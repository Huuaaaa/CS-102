This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r PE}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
PE <- read_csv("/cloud/project/Group Project (Survey)/UTAUT/CSV Files/PE.csv")

library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
PE <- read_csv("/cloud/project/Group Project (Survey)/UTAUT/CSV Files/PE.csv")

ggplot(PE, aes(x = Code, y = Mean)) +geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "yellow") +geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Mean - SD, ymax = Mean + SD), width = 0.4, color = "darkblue", size = 1) +labs(title = "Performance Expectancy Questions",x = "Questions",y = "Mean Score") +theme_minimal() 

```
