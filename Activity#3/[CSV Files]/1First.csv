"ThomDerd","5 January 2020","Grace is about to marry the youngest member of the very wealthy Le Domas family. But there's something sinister going on with this family... Well, the movie's central idea is not that new but the delivery of the idea, the pace and the performance of Samara Weaving really elevate this film. Entertaining and tense with comical moments that fit the genre, will make you follow almost all the characters in the film. Also kudos to the slow costume transformation of the bride and the juxtaposition of the prior wedding shots with what happens after, as this helps create a sense of relatability with Grace.One of the entertaining movies of 2019.8/10.","

"kosmasp","8 February 2020","Or is it? Right from the start we do realize there is more to it than just a simple game. So with that overshadowing the next section of the movie (viewer being ahead of our main character/heroine), it is up to the actors and the dialog/script to keep us on our toes and make this entertaining nonetheless.And the movie succeeds in doing so. I guess it could have been even better in some respects, but overall this is really good. The characters make sense (in their own universe) and the story is coherent enough (even if you may disagree with that statement during the end - I think the joke works quite well ... but that's me). Not for the faint hearted for sure ...","

"planktonrules","31 October 2020","""Ready of Not"" is a very, very violent, bloody and crude film. I am not necessarily criticizing it for this, but you must know this before you decide to watch. It clearly is an adult film...but even one most adults might have trouble watching because of all the gore. Be forewarned...you will see extreme violence, exploding people and more!!! Think twice before you watch!!This should be the best day of Grace's life. After all, she's just married a handsome guy from an incredibly wealthy family. But apparently, this marriage comes with a possible downside....the family are all Satan worshipers who owe their immense wealth to their demon master. And, as part of maintaining their wealth, they have a ritual for when new blood marries into the family...and if you pick the wrong card, the family hunts you and sacrifices you! What follows is this crazy family and their servants chasing Grace about in order to kill her and impress their lord and master!Despite the summary and TONS of blood and gore, the film is also a comedy. It's not a fall on the floor laughing sort of film but a darkly sick and twisted sort of comedy. The ending combines both...intense gore and the biggest laughs of the movie. Not everyone's taste...but funny and sick. And, it's also not for those who get motion sick, as the shaky cam is, unfortunately, overused in the movie.","

"UniqueParticle","21 August 2019","To me this was one of the best horror experiences have I ever had! Very suspenseful and fun to watch throughout! Samara Weaving is masterful in the type genre and I absolutely love how there's dark comedy in a few parts. It's very important to note this is very gory no it's not a spoiler just a warning for the squeamish type; for the horror fans you're in for a wonderful treat!Edit since this review is doing so well my name is Alex Nolan and I'd like to become very well known like Roger Ebert!!","

"TreasureHunterGirl","31 October 2019","Yes, it is a horror. Yes, it is a comedy. Yes, it is a great watch.I laughed a lot watching this movie. I also cringed a few times from the gorey horror. I didn't know much about it going in. I honestly couldn't pick how it would end which means I was interested the whole way through.I liked all of the performances, especially those of Samara Weaving and Adam Brody. They had interesting characters. Andie MacDowell and Henry Czerny were great too. Everyone was. No one let the team down.I really enjoyed this movie. I honestly don't understand all the 1 and 2 ratings. Even if you didn't like it, it doesn't deserve that low of a rating. It was just a really fun movie to watch. Give it a chance.","

"Leofwine_draca","20 October 2020","READY OR NOT is an interesting film but also a deeply flawed one that's never quite as funny or as entertaining as it tries to be. I liked the whole idea of the sinister rich family in their wonderful 'old dark house' inspired mansion and the idea of the heroine being hunted down, a little like the French flick FRONTIERS. Unfortunately what promises to be a TURKEY SHOOT-style cat and mouse story of human hunting turns into a largely aimless comedy with repetitive set-pieces and a sub-par script substituting bad language for wit. It's a pity, as the direction is solid and the performances are strong, but imagine this cast with proper dialogue to play with! I also found the climax a cop out as I was expecting this kind of over-obvious thing to happen. Not a bad film, just something I was expecting more from.","

"Bertaut","14 October 2019","Written by Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy, and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, Ready or Not is a horror-comedy and social satire that comically exaggerates the anxieties attendant with marrying into a wealthy family and mocks the insular nature of such families, so obsessed with their wealth that they've become disconnected from the real world. In the tradition of Richard Connell's 1924 short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"", the film is about elites hunting common folk, but it tells its story with tongue firmly in cheek. And whilst it can be a tad episodic at times, and the manner in which it presents some of its violence is somewhat problematic, this is a very enjoyable and funny film that's well worth checking out.It is the wedding day of Grace (an exceptional Samara Weaving) and Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), whose family earned their fortune making board games, and are now decadently wealthy. Several years previously, Alex turned his back on the family, and it's only since he met Grace (a foster child eager to have a family to call her own) that he has started to rebuild bridges. His mother Becky (Andie MacDowell) and father Tony (a barely sane Henry Czerny) are thrilled to have him back, and credit Grace with his return. His aunt Helene (a hilariously acerbic Nicky Guadagni), however, makes no bones about the fact that she hates Grace. Elsewhere there's Alex's brother Daniel (Adam Brody), an alcoholic locked in a loveless marriage to Charity (Elyse Levesque), and their cocaine-addicted sister Emilie (a wonderfully hapless Melanie Scrofano) and her husband Fitch (a scene-stealing Kristian Bruun). Shortly after the ceremony, Alex explains a strange family tradition to Grace - whenever someone new marries into the clan, they must participate in a game, chosen at random by a mechanised box using a deck of cards (Charity gor checkers). At an austere ceremony, Grace is asked to operate the box and she receives the hide and seek card, with Tony explaining that the only way for her to win is to stay hidden until dawn. And so, Grace hides in the mansion, unaware that the family (sans Alex) are arming themselves with crossbows, axes, hunting rifles, and assorted antique weaponry.The film's various psychoanalytical/satirical subtexts are fairly obvious - a lampooning of blue blood families clueless as to how the real world works, a savage deconstruction of the institution of marriage, and a gynocentric celebration of a woman fighting back against old-world patriarchy. In relation to these last two themes, nowhere are they more apparent than in Grace's wedding dress, that most classic symbol of marriage, which becomes dirtier and more damaged as the film progresses, with costume designer Avery Plewes using the dress to show the stages of Grace's symbolic deconstruction of the institution of marriage (to survive the night, she must make the dress more conducive to running and hiding, which involves a lot of ripping and tearing).Concerning the film's engagement with wealth, essentially it suggests that, yes, as we all know, the rich are very different from you and I, but could it be that not only are they different, maybe they're actually evil? Of course, it's not suggesting this with anything even approaching realism, and much of the film's humour comes from the Le Domas family itself; they're wealthy, evil, violent, and powerful, but so too are they hilariously incompetent. For example, it's been so long since anyone has got the hide and seek card that everyone is a little fuzzy on the rules, and they spend a good chunk of the film arguing with one another about the hunt - Fitch and Charity want to use modern weapons, but Tony maintains they have to use antique weaponry, nor are they allowed to use the castle's security cameras to track Grace.This all goes back to a century-old deal made between the family's original patriarch Victor and a mysterious traveller named Mr Le Bail, who promised Victor that the family would become hugely wealthy, but only if they maintained the tradition of having new family members play a game on their wedding night, laying out the rules for what was to happen if they got the hide and seek card. Tony argues that the rules can be no different from those originally established by Le Bail, but, really, his argument never amounts to much more than ""tradition...reasons"". The film gets a lot of laughs out of showing characters trying to get to grips with their weapon - from Fitch taking time out from the hunt to look up ""how to use a crossbow"" videos on YouTube to Emilie accidentally dispatching several maids due to her inability to handle her weapon.Another theme, although one not developed to the extent of the above, is religion. Le Bail, for example, is believed by the family to be a demonic figure, and his name, obviously enough, is an anagram of Belial, the demon from the Tanakh who would later form the basis for the Christian and Jewish depictions of Satan. On the other hand, Grace's name most likely references the idea of Divine grace. Elsewhere, the film depicts a pit of slaughtered goats, alluding to ritual animal sacrifice, a pre-Christian practice. Goats are also important in Christianity, especially in the practice of scapegoating, whereby a goat takes upon it the sins of the community and is cast into the desert, symbolically removing the taint of those sins (as per Leviticus 16:8-10). Along the same lines, Grace injures her hand on a nail, in a veiled reference to the Stigmata. However, whether or not we're supposed to interpret her as a Christ figure is hard to say as, although these references are interesting in isolation, they never really coalesce into anything concrete.Looking at some other problems, the film is, generally speaking, very slight; it's short and it's silly, and it's not going to change your life or lead you down the road of esoteric revolution. The violence is also (somewhat) problematic. The film maintains the stance that the rich are insane and the violence they mete out is contemptible. However, some of the biggest laughs are reserved for Emilie's accidental killing of the maids. And I have to admit, I found the way she haplessly dispatches two of them exceptionally funny. Also funny is that after one of the kills, the family are trying to have a conversation, which is continually interrupted by the gurgling of a mortally wounded maid; until Helene takes an axe to her head. And again, I have to admit, I laughed a lot at that scene, even though I recognised that the film was essentially asking the audience to see this violence as funny but some of the violence elsewhere as not so much. In this sense, it kind of wants to have its cake and eat it, picking and choosing when the audience should laugh; it takes Grace's stakes seriously but also encourages us to laugh at some (and only some) of the violence elsewhere, which is problematically inconsistent.Nevertheless, as I said, these scenes did make me laugh, so make of that what you will. Although Ready or Not is slight, its satirical ire is focused, even if the tendency towards irreverence doesn't always chime with the tone of the socio-political agenda. Allegorically skewering inherited wealth, marriage, tradition, even religion, the film suggest that with their atavistic rules and sense of entitlement, the Le Domas family embody the concept that old-money can lead to insularity from modernity. Offering us a match, the film suggests that perhaps the only way to deal with such irrelevancies and their sense of self-importance is to burn them to the ground. And it has a blast showing us why.","

"Slarkshark","30 July 2021","This was a good bit of fun. Dark comedy with plenty of gore and an explosive ending. Still filled with bonehead decision making, as one would expect with a horror type film.Samara Weaving does well as the bride, and surprisingly does not just turn into some random badass with a mystery background complete with combat training.Think 'Knives Out' mixed with 'The Hunt' and voila, you have 'Ready or Not'.","

The characters are perfect from the creepy over the top aunt to the leading protagonist Samara weaving. Acting is on point and the movie never slows up(dig to the crazy person saying it's boring)The movie actually has an ending, and what a great ending too. The movie delivers on everything they intended to give you and more.Sooo don't listen to the non constructive low critics and make your own decision and go watch","

"neil-476","12 November 2020","When Grace marries into the Le Domas family, whose great wealth is from the sales of games, it's not a huge surprise to find out that a family game features on her wedding night. The game is Hide and Seek, and it turns out that the object is not so much to avoid being found, it's more to avoid being found and killed.This simple idea is played for all it's worth between a varied crop of family members and the necessarily resourceful Grace. The cast is low profile but very good, the film is nicely staged, there is a decent story and script, and the combination of bloodshed and laughs works well. This is not laugh-out-loud, but the steady stream of black comedy is constantly amusing.I really liked this.","

"kluseba","23 August 2019","Ready or Not tries to be a mixture of a comedy and a horror movie and fails at both. The movie is never atmospheric, intense or scary enough to be a great horror movie. The film is never clever, surprising or vibrant enough to be an entertaining comedy movie. Even by poor b-movie standards, the story of this film is completely ridiculous in a way that it's almost insulting.If you were wondering why this film still deserves four points, the movie isn't entirely bad. The settings look great and especially the mansion where the sinister hide and seek game takes place is really gorgeous, including hidden hallways and elegant gardens. The movie features a few intense action scenes that make you root for the desperate lead character. The film has a fast pace and doesn't overstay its welcome with plodding storytelling. Lead actress Samara Weaving does her best with a poor script and has enough charisma to be the only great actress in this film.Ready or Not should be ignored since it's neither a gripping horror film nor a clever comedy. It's a shallow action film with a few gore elements. Movies like You're Next are similar in style but executed much better. The overtly positive reviews for Ready or Not show that expectations for horror movies have significantly decreased in an era of prequels, remakes, sequels and overall rehashed ideas. Refer to European or Asian cinema to find some creative horror movies these days.","

"tmpsvita","7 November 2020","Never seen a movie so dumb and so smart at te same time.
So dumb cause well just read the story it's almost ridiculously stupid but at the same time so smart cause it knows what it is: pure fun entertainment. It never takes itself too seriously, it often jokes about its nature and it plays with it constantly especially with over the top dialogs and grotesque characters that fit perfectly into every, absurd, situation.
Situations where the lead character, the spouse (that Samara Weaving plays with tons of charisma), acts exactly how we all would have done even with smart decisions that rarely in an horror a protagonist takes.
The intelligence of this movie is its awareness of how to work perfectly, with enough weirdness, enough absurdity, enough charisma, enough blood (so much blood) and this makes it a very fun, enjoyable experience.","

"Fella_shibby","23 November 2019","A bride has to spend her wedding night playing a game of hide n seek with her in laws. Unknown to her, the family has a tradition of sacrificing the new member before dawn to please satan or they might lose their life.
Whether she gets killed or whether the mumbo jumbo truly exists is the highlight which gets bogged down by the lack of suspense or tension.
Rightly stated by BA_Harrison that the secret doors, rooms n servant tunnels r not covered properly.
The film does get a bit monotonous. The side characters get killed while our scream queen gets to survive a hell lottuva ordeal.
The maids r hot babes but they dont have much to do. None of the kills r memorable.
Watch out for aunt Helene with her comical hairstyle n a never give up attitude who is always ready with an axe.","

"MissCzarChasm","25 November 2019","You know that when a film garners this much hate and reviews which call it ""Sick, sick, sick"" and ""disgusting"", and go on and on about how all the ""violence is towards women, blah, blah"" ... it has to be something special.And this one is.It is resonatingly (yes, I made that up) witty and really quite funny. In fact, it is almost too funny to be a ""horror"" film, and although it was certainly gory, it had nowhere near the gore of most horror films. It was just right IF you are looking for a film to satisfy the horror-seeking fan in you and which makes you laugh at the same time. In my book, the best of both worlds.As for the reviews which mention violence towards women: get over it. I'm a woman and I detest women like these reviewers who demand to be seen as something more, but then fail to live up to being able to 'take it'. Grow up. You give real women like me a bad name by association.In closing, this is one I highly suggest you watch for yourselves and make up your own mind about, but go in knowing that there is humor in it and hardly any scares. In short, a bloody good time.","

This is the third best movie of the year - not kidding.The movie manage to deliver all the blood, guts, and gory darkness you can possibly wish for together with plenty of laughs. This is horror, comedy and great acting in a movie which surprises and have one of the greatest ending of any movie I have seen in a long time.I do think that the movie feels too short, it should have been dragged out a little bit more - especially for us to get to know everyone a bit more so we feel more when they go poff or get their heads chopped off or shot or strangled or...
I also think a few things do not make total sense, however it is a horror drama comedy so I suppose that is not completely needed.
And sure, yes, it has a bit of that B-movie feel to it, the production value is not bad but it is not great either.
A few choices I wish was made different, but overall those are the negatives as I see them.I give it a 8/10, and I highly recommend.","

It's been a while since I've seen a horror film as satisfying (and as much fun) as this one.From the trailer, I expected a slapstick comedy horror, but this was not the case - thankfully. Although the film contains humor (that are actually funny and not slapstick), this was a nerve wrecking, suspenseful film that crawled in under my skin.Samara Weaving is FANTASTIC as Grace, the unsuspecting bride. The film might not have worked so well with another lead. She's the perfect lead for this film. 'Ready or Not' is a very different and refreshing take on the slasher genre. I also loved the setting in the big mansion. The film is wonderfully mysterious in the beginning and keeps you guessing until the finale. There's a few unexpected twists, as well.

"GusherPop","30 November 2022","Grace (Samara Weaving) loves Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien) so much that she's tolerated the hoops through which his family have made her jump: Alcoholic wastrel Daniel (Adam Brody) hitting on her, mother Becky (Andie MacDowell) being somewhat cagey about her approval, sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) not even showing up in time for the ceremony, father Tony (Henry Czerny) outright voicing his displeasure at the girl's status and aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni) staring daggers at her from the moment they met. They're a bizarre bunch but Grace sees the light at the end of the tunnel now that they've all congregated at the Le Domas manor for the nuptials. However, and it's a big however, the film is charismatic and thrilling enough to bypass its shortcomings. Weaving makes for a very likable hero, with a broad comedic appeal, an every-girl clumsiness and sarcastic rejoinder for everything. In a better world, she'd be headlining comedies already. She makes for a likable action hero precisely because she knows and shows that the clothes don't fit her. In her tattered wedding dress, she fights for her life against everyone from her young nephews to the butler. Every wound she receive shows her that the backwards morality by which the rich live is so deeply ingrained that no amount of pleading could right the course. It's also her first clue that not even her beloved Alex will be able to get her out of this jam. She's not just fighting people, she's fighting tradition and the idea of family. By the time the games come to an end, ""Ready or Not"" has ceased to be about the rich and the poor. It's about a girl trying to survive a violent ordeal, which is potent enough for the moment you're watching the film, but in a climate in which politics can pull a film from a release schedule, now is not the time to hide.","

"Bibliophile100","8 February 2023","As Katniss Everdeen said in the final book (and film) of The Hunger Games: ""There are much worse games to play"". The game in the comedy horror film Ready or Not...is definitely one of those ""worse games""!When a bride-to-be is married into a lavish, rich, and weird family, she soon discovers that they really stick to tradition...and tradition in this house, is anything but fun and games! Each time someone is welcomed into the family, they must play a game. For the bride, the game is hide and seek. All she has to do, is avoid being caught by dawn. Sounds easy right? Well, not with the family armed with ancient weapons and planning to perform a ritual on you it isn't! With the bride's new husband being the only reluctant and helpful one, she must outwit, out hide, and out smart the deranged and insane clan, until a supposable curse threatens to, supposably kill the family!I made a brilliant choice to see this film! And you will too, if you decide to play the game! The direction of Mr. Matt Bettinelli Olpin, and Mr. Tyler Gillett is excellent! I loved how the camera follows and moves with those who are running for their lives, and the still shots on lots of stuffed animal heads and pictures on the walls; these shots made the film seem a bit like a 90's or 80's era film, which I appreciated. The dark humor was pretty good too, but I especially loved the acting. I adored all the cast members and their splendid talent, especially, Samara Weaving, who played the traumatized, and frightened bride! As for the supposable death that will befall the family if dawn arrives...well, even they aren't sure if it's true! And that's part of the curious mystery!To any brides-to-be-wedded-into-a-new-family, be careful whose family you're welcomed to join, for as the words on the movie poster say: ""In-laws can be murder!""","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","29 January 2023","A bride's wedding night becomes a nightmare.This is about class warfare which is here made literal. Thankfully, much like in real life, the 1% are impressively incompetent. Many of them will spend their entire lives failing upwards, like for example Donald Trump, who was President when this hit theatres. This doesn't have anyone who's a direct analogue for him, although some of the more notable things about him are spread across multiple, like terrible hair, overconfidence, etc.This manages to be one of the most tense and hilarious films I have ever seen. Like Jordan Peele, directorial duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett understand that today, it is necessary to subvert some of the horror tropes because otherwise we know what's coming. However, others have to be played straight, otherwise it becomes a parody, which is not the desired outcome.This features some bloody, gory, violent, disturbing content, and a lot of swearing. I recommend this to any progressive with a tough stomach. 8/10.","

"aidanratesmovies","23 February 2020","Surprisingly smart, nimble, and by far an absolute blast- Ready or Not truly makes the best of its absurd premise, by not taking itself too seriously and finding a sheer sense of energy and balance between the humor and the chaos ensued. Samara Weaving leads a surprisingly great cast, with a performance that was absolutely perfect for the role involved. All other characters gave quite good performances as well, and to my surprise, none of their acting seemed too forced or taken too far. The script at times can prove to be a bit messy, but it is all in good fun, and by the time it is over, you will almost be impressed with the lengths it covered in such a short runtime. The pacing is quite good, and the cinematography is quite brilliant. For such a small budgeted film, you can't help but be blown away by the amount of quality involved in such a film. It simply shouldn't be and feel as it good as it is, and yet, it is true. Ready or Not is easily one of the best surprises of 2019, and proves that an absurd concept can be quite a good film, if having the right people involved.

"iamianiman","22 August 2019","Ready or Not is a fresh take on the slasher genre. It crafts a creative arch on the basic storyline concept that is rarely done in movies with similar genre. It is not the typical house invasion or vacation goes wrong.Ready or Not serves a plate of dark comedy that escalates as the run time goes along. What makes this so great is the general get to spot each laugh easily, not just its specific target audience.For a slasher film, Ready or Not deserves an applaud for its remarkable acting performances by the cast. Everyone shows their distinct characters from behaviour to costume that they are so entertaining to watch similar to that feeling when you get dozens of characters to choose from in a game.The lead character, the one who you will be rooting for is created in such a way that she is not dumb like in most movies. However, she is not smart either but the circumstances make her character safe from the trap of being a daft person. In other words, the movie does not unravel her intelligence nor her ludicrous manner.Also, the lead character has little to no character development. The fundamental question of her historical context and background is extremely lacking that we as the audience fail to connect with her as humanely as possible.The biggest complaint has got to be the rushing third act (final 30 minutes). The first two acts peel its layer off one by one steadily but the third act however loses its balance and goes downhill. They tried to do something completely different but it fails to satisfy the audience because we want something more pleasurable than what they have given us.Verdict: Ready or Not is a phenomenal gem that breaks the stigma free of 'slasher genre is dead'. However, it is not considered a masterpiece although seems very close due to its disastrous third act nature that falls short compared to the other two acts.","

"BA_Harrison","26 September 2019","After Grace (Samara Weaving) marries into a wealthy family who have made their fortune creating board games, she finds that she must participate in a game of hide and seek before she will be properly accepted as one of the clan. But as Grace hides in the sprawling family mansion, her new in-laws tool up with a variety of weapons and set out to find and kill the young woman as part of a Satanic ritual.After watching Mayhem and The Babysitter, I found that I had developed a strong aversion to Samara Weaving's scream, a horrible warbling sound that sets my teeth in edge, but I was willing to try and put my animosity to one side for Ready or Not, the trailer for which looked like a lot of fun. I failed: her scream still got on my nerves, but as it happens, Weaving's warbling was just one of many reasons why I didn't enjoy this film.All of the characters are unlikable (Grace included) and unbelievable (husband Alex does a 180-degree personality flip), the plot goes nowhere for most of the film, the intended dark comedy falls horribly flat, the ending is predictable (reminding me a little of Drag Me To Hell), the location is underused (the servants tunnels, in particular, are totally wasted), and for a film given an 18 certificate for 'bloody violence and strong scenes of gore', there's very little in the way of inventive or graphic kills. Also, try as hard as you can, but you'll never convince me that it is possible to saw through a solid piece of hardwood with the chain on a pair of handcuffs.Save your money, save your time and save the strain on your ear drums (that scream!!!).3.5/10, generously rounded up to 4 for the creepy Hide and Seek song.","

For horror/thriller/B-movie fans, this was a gold mine. The concept was refreshing. If you're not smiling at the end of the movie, then this genre isn't for you.","

"SnoopyStyle","28 October 2020","Grace (Samara Weaving) and Alex (Mark O'Brien) are getting married at his rich family's massive estate. She's informed that she must play a game before being admitted into the family. It's a matter of life and death.I didn't expect much from this B-horror with no big fanfare. One or two of these fun little horrors out-jumps its peers every year and this is one of them. It has a lot of fun. Samara is a solid lead. It has a fun takedown of wealth and family corruption. The movie takes a fun thrill-filled idea and executes it. It's comparable to Happy Death Day.","

"rivertam26","21 February 2020","This wild little horror gem centers on a feisty young woman who gets married to the member of a crazy rich family whom she discovers plays a game to determine if their new member will be a sacrifice or not. The movie is tongue and cheek and is filled with gags both creepy and hilarious. The lead performance from Samara Weaving, so great in Netflix's the Babysitter is truly a thrilling, layered portrait. All in all the movie is fun even if it feels a slight bit gimmicky at times.","

"jtindahouse","9 September 2019","The first thing you'll notice when watching 'Ready or Not' is how good the dialogue is. Horror movies are notorious for having terrible, bland, uninteresting dialogue, but the lines written for this film (and it does help that there are some very good actors delivering them to be fair) are superb. That sets the tone, and then the story takes over. I love how mysterious this movie is. You're always on edge because you feel like the film has more up its sleep than its showing you. This is a really well made horror movie.The cast of characters is just so great. There isn't a bland one amongst them. They all add something to the film and collectively make it so great. I would be remiss not to mention Samara Weaving in the main role. She is incredible. She is the horror character filmmakers dream of creating, because you can't help but root for her.Even though this was a great movie throughout, I couldn't help feeling the ending was going to play a large part in how people were going to feel about it. So did it stick the landing? It did so and more. The ending was handled brilliantly and was the icing on the cake to an already great film. I can't recommend 'Ready or Not' highly enough. See this film.","

"nogodnomasters","13 September 2019","The film is a dark comedy and a generic spoof of family ritualistic satanic films. It opens with a wedding to Beethoven's 9th symphony D minor etc played during ""Clockwork Orange"" while Alex DeLong was being tortured by his own love for the music. Grace, a commoner (Samara Weaving) is going to wed Alex Le Domas whose family has ""more money than God."" They made their money from the manufacturing of games. At Midnight, they must play a game drawn from a card taken from an old box that they play or die. Grace was hoping for checkers.The title hints at the game and film poster of an armed bride who is dirty, tattered, and torn tells you what happens. The film had a number of light moments with an ending that made me laugh. Melanie Scrofano plays Emilie who loves her cocaine and can't shoot straight. Some of the players are apathetic about the game but play because they are told they must or die. The family consisted of a cast of characters that made the film fun.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","

"Reviews_of_the_Dead","23 August 2019","This was a film that I was excited to check out as I caught part of the trailer. When I saw that it starred Samara Weaving that was when I knew I was on-board. The concept was something that had me intrigued as well. I hadn't seen this since the theater and am now giving it a second viewing as part of the Summer Series for the Podcast Under the Stairs. The synopsis is a bride's wedding night takes a sinister turn when her eccentric new in-laws force her to take part in a terrifying game.We start this film off with two little kids running away from someone. They are Daniel and Alex. Daniel has his brother hide in a closet and when he turns, a man asks for his help. He yells for others to come and when they do, the man is shot with arrows. He's then taken away while a woman named Helene breaks down.The film then alerts us that we shifting 30 years into the present. It is the wedding day of Grace (Weaving) to Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien). The Le Domas are a rich family that made their fortune off of board games. Daniel (Adam Brody) is an alcoholic, but still fairly close to his brother.Grace is scared the family doesn't like her, because of how rich and snooty they are. We get to know them through the pictures before the ceremony. The father is Tony (Henry Czerny) and he's married to Becky (Andie MacDowell). Daniel is married to Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) and they really don't get along. There's also Aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni) who keeps giving Grace the evil eye.As the night progresses, Alex finally reveals to his new bride that at midnight they are required to play a game. It is family tradition. Showing up just in time is Alex's sister Charity (Elyse Levesque) and her husband, Fitch (Kristian Bruun) with their two kids. They go into a room reserved for family only. There's a box that will decide the game they have to play that night. You can guess what it is from the title of the film. Grace doesn't take it too seriously, but her in-laws do. She has to survive until dawn, but they have a lot riding on her not making it.That should be enough of a recap without spoiling anything. I want to start this off by stating that this is a fun film. I had a blast with this one and it is actually quite hilarious. To be honest though, as the film progresses, I did see some deeper things here that I really enjoyed as well. Regardless, this is a fun, popcorn horror movie that doesn't shy away from the violence and the gore.The first of which to cover is the symbolism of Grace vs. The Le Domas. She is wearing a white wedding dress and they're wearing mostly dark clothes. I took this as she is good and them being the evil. It is even more interesting in this idea as some things get revealed as to why they have to play this game and what they think will happen if they don't complete what they need to do. I also like that she is wounded and her dress gets dirtier, she becomes stronger in fighting back. It is showing that change that comes over her as she grows harder.As it went on, I also picked up the idea of old traditions against the new ways of life. The Le Domas are old money. I like the idea how they earned it and they are trying to adhere to the rules of the game. The problem is that as it goes on, they get scared. They want to break tradition for the sake of winning. I thought this is a fitting look at the rich, who tend to bend the laws for their own gain. Going from there though, Alex is torn between protecting his new wife and the life that they could be making for themselves and his duty to his family. It is funny how inept this family is at hunting her. It definitely sounds like it was much easier as the ancestors were actually hunters. The deeper the generations go, the less skilled they are due to their easier upbringing.I do have to admit there is something that happened late in the film I could have done without after my first viewing. After listening to others talk about it and now giving it a second viewing, I don't have my issues there. It makes sense for what the movie is building to and that fear of what could happen if they fail.The pacing of the film though is something that is good as well. The film really just gets right into introducing the characters and getting to the game within the first half hour or so. I do like that we see a gradual change in Grace as she has to go to greater and greater lengths of surviving. There wasn't anything in the film that really bogged it down for me and I had fun all the way through.Something that was really good here was the acting. On a podcast I heard them compare Weaving to the horror Margot Robbie and I love this comparison. She is such a beautiful woman, but she is an amazing actress as well. I love how quirky her character is and she gives off that vibe that she is down to Earth without realizing how good looking she is. I love the change in her character as things happen to her. Brody is good here as well. There is an issue I have after this viewing with decisions this character makes. It feels like it is there to push the movie and doesn't make sense. Much like O'Brien, who is fine in his role, they're dealing with keeping up with traditional or finally breaking it to move on. I thought the rest of the family and staff was fitting for what was needed, they definitely rounded out the film and they all kind of bring their own humor to their specific roles.As for the effects of the film, I think there was some CGI, but to be honest I was stoked to see that they went practical. This film can be quite brutal at times and there are some things that Grace goes through that had me cringing. The CGI that was used looked good to me and I didn't notice it. There was good amount of blood and gore for me, so no complaints. The film is also shot very well as it does do some interesting angles so credit to the cinematography.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film, which I have to admit didn't really stand out. It did fit the scenes for what was needed and it helped to build tension. The only time I remember it was when they play this 'Hide and Seek' song. It is an old timey one and was quite eerie if I'm honest. I might see if I can find it actually. Regardless, I like the vibe that song gives.Now with that said, this film is definitely a fun one. I heard that, but I like to check things out for myself and it didn't disappoint. I thought it had an interesting concept, by taking a children's game and turning it deadly. I like the social commentary we are getting here and how it is plausible a family like this could get away with it. It is paced well, it built tension and I never got bored. I thought the acting from Weaving was good while the rest definitely rounded out the film for what is needed. Even the comedy worked for me as it doesn't take anything away from the movie or the tension. The effects were great, both the practical and the CGI. The soundtrack didn't stand out aside from one song, but I don't have a lot of complaints either. I'm not always the biggest horror/comedy fan, but there was something about this one that I liked. I thought this was good, bordering on being great for me.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.","

She is nervous but eager to join his family's gaming ""dominion"", which is how they came about their enormous wealth. The couple go for a photo-shoot prior to the ceremony, along with other members of Alex's family. Daniel (Adam Brody) is joined by his wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), who is open about the fact that she only married Daniel for his family's money. Their father Tony (Henry Czerny) is visibly disapproving of Grace, but not nearly as much as Helene (Nicky Guadagni), who shoots Grace a death glare. More approving is Alex and Daniel's mother Becky (Andie MacDowell), who tells Grace that only Alex's opinion matters. Moments later, everyone gathers for the ceremony, and Grace and Alex are married. All of us have made certain efforts so our in-laws will like us , but Grace is going to have to give it her all if she wants to fit in with her brand new husband's wealthy dynasty, who require her to follow a brutal tradition: for the bride to try to survive her wedding night while the rest of them hunt her down .

In-laws can be murder !.Grisly thriller with extreme violence , gory scenes , twists and turns , that's why the bride's wedding night takes a sinister change once her eccentric new in-laws force her to take part in a terrifying game . The story points are not so obvious and Samara Weaving is the heroin that every viewer will cheer , she seems to be a fragile woman but her reaction is really surprising in similar style to Sharni Vinson , recalling the lead character in ¨Adam Wingard's You're Next (2011)¨ . The class struggle stuff hits the proverbial fan in this extremely murder-thriller with ironical and fantastic touches . Packs large amount of struggles , guts and gore , there's a huge body count , this one actually knocks off an immense amount with extremely gory scenes and strong violence . This is an intriguing film in Slasher style that begins with a reunion of family , but then things collide in horrifying and criminal happenings . A lot of the movie was shot at Casa Loma in Toronto, Ontario, Canada , it is a designated heritage property and is a museum that is open to the public and exterior shots of the mansion from the film were of Parkwood Estates in Oshawa, Ontario (Canada) . This nail-biting movie displays plot twists , action enough , thrills ride , spectacular fighting , graphic violence, and is pretty entertaining . A really black satire starring a brilliant Samara Weaving and including an uncommonly perverse Andie MacDowell , along with other enjoyable actors , such as : Adam Brody , Mark O'Brien , Henry Czerny , Melanie Scrofano , Kristian Bruun , Elyse Levesque and John Ralston.It displays a colorful though dark cinematography by cameraman Brett Jutkiewicz . As well as thrilling and suspenseful musical score by Brian Tyler. The motion picture was well direced by two directors: Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett and the 35-day shoot took place at locations around the Toronto, Ontario area, including Casa Loma, Sunnybrook Park and the Claireville Conservation Area . Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett are two craftsmen , two writers/filmmakers experts on terror films , such as : Southbound (2015) , Devil's Due (2014) , V/H/S (2012) , Scream VI (2023) , Scream (2022) and Ready or no (2019) .

"slinky_gurl","5 September 2019","I don't even know where to start. I loved this movie! The idea felt fresh, the actors were amazing. Although it had its slow moments there was always something around the corner.
Although hilarious and horror is something you usually wouldn't think to put together it just worked, reminded me of the original nightmare on elm street.The lead actress was great (especially at the end which was one I did not see coming and boy was it great). I do have to say in my opinion the star of the movie was Adam Brody, he played his character perfectly and just as you'd expect delivered some of the best/most sarcastic lines.
I have recommended everyone I know to go see this movie. Glad I saw it in theatres and will definitely be buying it so I can watch it at home!","

"ferguson-6","21 August 2019","Greetings again from the darkness. Rich people aren't like you and me (unless you happen to be rich, in which case you fall into the first category). Their houses are different. Their vacations are different. Their family traditions are different. And that's where this latest from co-directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillet (known collectively with Producer Matt Villella as Radio Silence) really kicks in. Yes, the Le Domas estate is a maze of dark wood, music rooms, and hidden passages, but it's the wedding day tradition of post nuptial game night that provides the thrills, chills, shocks and laughter for about an hour and a half.Former foster child Grace (a star-making performance from Samara Weaving, THE BABYSITTER, THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING MO), is nervous and excited just before her wedding ceremony begins. Her husband to be is Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), the black sheep of an ultra-rich family, and the ceremony is being held within the lush garden and fountain grounds of the Le Domas mansion. Grace loves Alex and seems to have come to grips with his family: alcoholic brother Daniel (Adam Brody) who is always hitting on her, Daniel's gold-digger wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), father and patriarch Tony (Henry Czerny) who is outspoken in his belief that Grace isn't good enough for the family, mother and matriarch Becky (Andie MacDowell) who seems confused about her feelings towards Grace, crazy-eyed Aunt Helene (Nicky Guardagni) who seems to hate all living creatures, and coke-head sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) who, along with her husband Fitch (Kristian Bruun) couldn't even get to the ceremony on time.The above lineup of players is crucial because of what happens next. For wedding day game night, Grace draws the ""Hide and Seek"" card, rather than the much preferred checkers or Old Maid. There is a nice set up for this tradition which includes a Faustian deal made by Great Grandfather Le Domas. It's that deal that turns 'hide and seek' into 'hunt and kill'. Oh yeah, Alex forgot to warn Grace about the stakes and it's a blast to watch her transition as she figures it out. A torn wedding gown and yellow Chucks make up the visual of a bride fighting back against the antique weapons of crossbow, pocket pistol, elephant gun and battle-axe. You got it right - this family tradition is absolutely bonkers ... and bloody ... and deadly.As has become the favorite pastime of Hollywood recently, the film torches the ultra-rich. But if you can overlook the political posturings, you'll find a devilishly fun irreverent farcical zinger that offers some similarities to CLUE and SLEUTH, as well as many other games and movies. It has some of the look of SAW, but with significantly more tongue-in-cheek. In fact, dark comedy thriller might be a proper description, but you'll likely find yourself laughing more often than jumping in your seat. It's a wonderfully crafted and paced film that understands exactly what it is ... an instant classic Midnight Movie (along with this year's SATANIC PANIC from director Chelsea Stardust).Co-writers Guy Busick and Ryan Murphy take full advantage of the ominous setting and the wicked set-up, however, a minor quibble would be that the dialogue could have been a bit wittier. Most of the laughs come courtesy of the moment or the actors, and the banter falls just a little short. The prologue provides a 30 year ago flashback that cautions us for the ride we are about to take, and even offers some insight into the characters as much younger versions of themselves. The opening credit sequence is a beautifully staged and filmed running shot of some classic board games, informing us of the industry closely associated with the Le Domas 'dominion'.It must be noted that a studio recently postponed the theatrical release of THE HUNT because of the political backlash to their premise - rich people hunting poor people. While the themes of these two films could be considered similar, only the most extreme hard-liners could view READY OR NOT as anything more than good demented fun. Much of the primary production was filmed on location at the Parkwood Estate in Ontario, and it's the perfect setting for a family that chooses murder and fortune over all else. Two standouts on the soundtrack include ""The Hide and Seek Song"" by Headquarters Music and ""Love Me Tender"" by Stereo Jane (definitely not Elvis). For those who enjoy the twisted comedy approach to in-law jokes and violence, there are plenty of macabre moments that will deliver a smile ... till death do us part.","

"lee_eisenberg","25 August 2019","Two years ago, ""Get Out"" addressed racism through the prism of a not-what-it-seems relationship. Now, ""Ready or Not"" looks at class structure through the same format. Much like how ""Crazy Rich Asians"" showed how rich people expect their children only to marry within their ""respectable"" range, this one shows how anyone from outside the country club crows is immediately ""the other"" to these people. And if the bride is the other, you can do whatever you want to her. Mind you, there are some shocking scenes. But it's all well done. Definitely see it.","

Not even close. The useless main character was the definition of a ""damsel in distress"" needing someone to save them.She stumbled through the entire film, only surviving because of another character protecting her, the fact that her attackers were ridiculously inept, and pure blind luck, even in the end. Very disappointing. Very unsatisfying. Great cast though, but totally wasted on a weak script and direction.","

"peeedeee-94281","31 August 2019","I was intrigued by this one because of all the positive reviews, even though the trailer didn't quite sell it for me. It looked like a cross between The Purge and Eyes Wide Shut.
Anyway, the movie starts of alright, the set up for what is about to come first with a flashback of the childhood of the boys, who then we see in present day is getting married to a blonde outsider played by Samara Weaving.
I actually liked her initially. She seemed like someone we could root for and hope would kick some serious butt. Ultimately, I found her unlikable, just like all the other characters in the film. What was it about her I didn't like? Well, she just doesn't sell the role very well. Is she bad ass or is she just lucky, everything seems to work out too conveniently for her, considering she has several people hunting for her. She doesn't appear to have any fighting skills. But the worst part: Her scream. Ugh, every time she did that yodeling scream, I couldn't stop thinking about Adam Sandler in the waterboy. Or tarzan lol. I've never heard an annoying scream like that before lol.
The story's pacing and tone is just all over the place. Much of the killing is accidental, nothing happens due to skill. There were too many predictable moments, like that 'goat pit' or whatever they called it that scene was too obvious where it was going. And clearly the family didn't care about piling bodies out in the open?!
And the swearing was terrible. I'm no prude, and I look a good f word in the right place, but this movie was mainly filled with unfunny moments where the characters keep saying wtf over and over. The dialogue really needed improving.
The ending was kind of funny, but ultimately, unsatisfying. It really didn't make any sense either.
Overall, this movie was just okay, I'd recommend watching it on Netflix. I watched for a discount price so I can't complain. I give it 2 marks for the reasonably good CGI gore in a few places, but that's about it.","

"abhijith-alpha","2 May 2020","READY OR NOT: A REVIEWThe movie is about a young woman marrying into a rich and eccentric family, who force her to play a deadly game on the wedding night to be accepted into it. Samara Weaving plays the poor bride who fell in love with a rich guy, who discovers, to her shock, that her in-laws want to kill her before the sun rises on her wedding night.The idea isn't exactly original. The direction is somewhat listless and tries to rely heavily on horror movie tropes. The actors try to make it convincing but this is a group collected on their good looks more than their abilities. Compounding the issue, the weak screenplay and weird lighting and colour grading saps the performance out of even a seasoned veteran like Andie MacDowell, the most well known among the cast. This movie has bits and parts that work for it, but overall it was a letdown. The twists and turns of the scripts were telegraphed miles before they arrived; the physical comedy and horror wasn't distinct enough to compensate for the unoriginality; the character motivations were predictable and overall falls flat.Weaving tries her best, one of the young actors with good screen presence. Her performance is caught between the unlucky young woman running from an unfair situation and the vengeful bride a la Kill Bill. But her strong screen presence is wasted here in script indecision as she shifts back and forth between these two personas too many times to weaken the arc. Surprisingly, Adam Brody, whose character started off as the stock irresponsible brother, is the most realized character in the movie, and was the only one who held my interest every time he was on screen. His inner turmoil, the wrestling between emotions of guilt and shame, and loyalty to the family, is a good example of an actor making the best out of the limited range his script originally allowed him to do.Most movie tropes are present in ""Ready or Not"", the lucky girl, the sensitive rich guy who hates his rich family, the sneering matriarch, the charismatic and scenery chewing dad, the practical and in-charge mom, perpetually drunk brother, in-laws varyingly ambitious to spoilt, professionally creepy family butler and the unfortunate maidservants. Unfortunately the director seems to have stopped halfway between making the film a truly great horror film that also provides scathing social commentary. The movie seems to have settled into a middle path between proper satire and shallow commentary on the state of the world. Considering how much the ideas of the callousness of the rich towards the less privileged have been expressed well in many horror movies, and the overall script had the wherewithal to deliver it, this movie falls short for me. Sometimes, fun and gore, packaged somewhat competently, isn't enough for me to rate a movie good. This movie is good, but only by a small margin. I wouldn't watch it again.FINAL THOUGHTS
What a waste of an opportunity. All the ingredients where there, just not in the right amounts.Andie MacDowell looks weird. I blame the editing and the lighting.Adam Brody is really good.Some of the cinematography is really good. The inside of the mansion, in many scenes, is simply beautiful.RATING 5.5/10","

"HafizhMaulana21","5 March 2023","When a family wedding turns into a deadly game, a bride must survive before dawn.Ready or Not, a title that strongly describes how deadly the game is in this film. A game of hide and seek that is displayed is gruesome and brutal. And of course it is very bloody. Ready or Not gives quite a different sense of mystery thriller. With the combination of comedy, it certainly adds to the strength of this film, which indeed throughout the film does not provide much attention that is suspenseful continuously. Many scenes are filled with dark comedy stories. The plot of the story feels ups and downs with conflicts that do not come continuously. The film gives a lot of room to combine thriller, mystery and comedy so that the impression of conflict does not immediately strengthen in some acts. Moreover, Ready or Not leaves no sense of horror and sadism in the film. Some scenes feature an overly graphic depiction of the gruesome and deadly game.","

"donttouchmeprimate","14 December 2019","-After eating one of those festive ""Halloween"" burgers that fast food establishments do every year.Very simple plot with a great cast. Of course this is a slasher flick so expect some intense moments mixed in with some equally awful writing when it comes to logical decisions, but it's full of story and some very funny moments.It's a film I can see myself putting on again at some point. So all in all. It's pretty good for what it is.
Poor Clara, she was my favourite.","

"peterp-450-298716","17 December 2019","So, at midnight you have to play a game.
It's just something we do when someone new joins the family.I have to revise my opinion about the horror/comedy cross-over urgently after seeing ""Monster Party"" and ""The dead don't die"" this year. ""Ready or not"" is yet another film that pleasantly surprised me. Really. I had a great time watching this movie. And not only because the lead actress Samara Weaving looks appetizing, but also because of the entertaining content. I appreciated the morbid black humor as well. It's not such absurd humor as in ""The dead don't die"". But the slapstick-like events that were used in it, resulted in a spontaneous chuckle sometimes. There were also quite a few bloody scenes in it. In short, it was fun watching this horror flick.And all because of playing an innocent game of ""hide and seek"". Grace (Samara Weaving) chose that on her wedding night by pulling a card out of a wooden box. Apparently, the Le Domas family, who made their fortune in the board gaming world, has a recurring family tradition at weddings. So the moment Grace got a wedding ring from Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), her brand new husband, she unknowingly became part of this tradition. So instead of playing a game of hanky-panky and frolicking in the old-fashioned-looking four-poster bed, the wedding couple is requested to go to the family room to play an old-fashioned board game. What Grace doesn't realize is that there's one special card that can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the evening. Guess what. Yep indeed, she draws the card in question.It was not only the course of the story I found enormously fascinating and ingenious. Also, the setting where it all took place was beautiful to see. A huge Victorian house, full of dark corners and niches. Such a huge villa that suits a wealthy family like Le Domas perfectly. Full of wood paneling, majestic staircases, and richly decorated corridors. As a child, you could easily get lost there. And that's where the innocent ""hide and seek"" takes place. At the beginning Grace enthusiastically participates. Until she realizes that nobody from the Le Domas family starts the countdown and starts shouting ""Ready or Not, Here I come"" (hence the film title). Instead, this insane family has armed itself with old, primitive weapons and starts hunting her.The most hilarious thing about the film is the family members themselves. All of them are cartoonish, caricatural characters. From the authoritarian somewhat empty-headed paterfamilias Tony (Henry Czerny) and his wife Becky (Andie MacDowell) to the scary-looking, shrewish aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni). The latter is the most extreme character. She looks as if she's a member of a satanic cult with her purple suit, black nail polish and upright Cruella de Vil hairstyle. And when you see her running through the corridors, screaming frantically and waving with a huge lumberjack's ax, the picture is complete. Add a bunch of other family members to it, such as the alcoholic son Daniel (Adam Brody) and his cheeky wife Charity (Elyse Levesque). The coke-addicted daughter Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) and her cowardly husband Fitch (Kristian Bruun). And of course the butler should not be missing. Together they form a colorful ""Adam's Family"" -like collective.Finally something about the horror part. Even though the overall atmosphere is rather lighthearted and caricatural, the hardcore horror fanatic will enjoy certain moments. This gothic horror is filled with a few gory and bloody scenes while maintaining an exciting pace. I found the part in the barn particularly successful and at the same time extremely funny. You see the nail. You see the hole in a hand. And you immediately know how these two facts will be linked. Sublime. And even though you know where it's going, I was surprised by the denouement. A denouement that would make Quentin Tarantino jealous. And I suppose they wanted to show how huge the gap is between rich and poor. In the end, this was just a minor side issue. ""Ready or not"" is perhaps the cruel version of the Cinderella fairy tale. But ultimate entertainment was the main goal here. And they certainly have succeeded in that for me.More reviews here: movie-freak.be","

"Carycomic","28 August 2019","I had a choice between two movies on this rainy afternoon. DORA THE EXPLORER...or READY OR NOT. D.T.E. started sooner, so I chose that one.Boy! Was that a mistake.After twenty-five minutes of listening to Dora breaking the Fourth Wall, like an adolescent poor's man version of Deadpool, I walked out of the theater and bought a ticket to R. O. N. A mixed blessing, to say the least. But, on the bright side I was able to sit through the entirety of it. And, even better, I was the only one in the audience during the matinee I chose! So, I was able to make slightly sarcastic comments, half out loud, without being shushed by other movie-goers.A good thing, too.The first half of this film is only mildly amusing...and definitely nowhere near as suspenseful as the second half. I mean, just the opening shot of all those board games (and one in particular) gives you a pretty good idea what the back story for this weirdo family is going to be!Then, there's all the swearing.Were the writers getting paid by the profanity? I haven't heard that many F-bombs dropped since the original CABIN FEVER! Which, if memory serves, I accused the cast thereof of trying to sound like vintage Robert Deniro...with none of his acting talent. Well, the same holds true for most of the cast of R.O.N. The only notable exceptions are Samara Weaving, who's totally new to me (and totally believable as the unexpectedly feisty Grace); and Andie McDowell, the only recognizably big name in the cast.In summary, then, I give this five stars (four stars better than JENNIFER'S BODY). As in; not bad! But, I've definitely seen comparatively scarier.","

"Breumaster","15 February 2020","The Movies is not as comedic as the trailer makes believe into. But the movie sure has it's comedic moments. I expected a little more story, action or comedic fun, but after viewing the movie, I can say that it is pretty more bloody and gory than expected. The R-rating fits for today, 15 years ago it would have been a nc-17-rating. But I also noticed that most of the hunting scenes were somehow generic. The pure hunt had no fresh ideas or turns in it. There are many similar hunting stories like this on on the market. Just think on 'Surviving the Game' or 'The Collector', but this one has an occult background, which makes it interesting. The setting in the house looks worthy, the light and camera professional. The climax has some very funny moments, we had a bizarre laugh at. All in all, it's a kinky ending. I would consider it as a recommendation for people who like dark humor and sarcasm.","

"jadepietro","4 September 2019","GRADE: D+THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: This newlywed game is an awful horror film that dispatches its dark comedy origins more quickly than its bloody victims.JIM'S REVIEW: Summer 2019 was the bleakest of times...hurricanes destroying the lives of many survivors, mass shootings with no gun regulation in sight, a roller-coaster of a economy due to unnecessary trade wars, an unhinged president...and one of the most disappointing movie roster to ever (dis)grace the tarnishing silver screen. Take your pick, which was the worst...all were bad news. Let us beg the gods above that September brings with it an autumnal bounty of good news.That said, my first fall film experience is Ready or Not, a slice-and dice horror send-up about the trials and tribulations of matrimonial bliss when one is confronted with in-laws whose sole purpose is to play a game I would like to called Kill the Bride. This wealthy family has a tradition of playing games like hide-and-seek on one's wedding night to welcome the newest member to the family. So let the games begin, of course, at the stroke of midnight.Yes, you might say that the premise is very far-fetched and ludicrous. You could say that I knew what I was about to see from the trailer. And I would wholeheartedly agree with your statements. But my hopes as a reviewer were still high, if a bit naive as our plucky heroine, that this strange little movie might have a sharp (literally) comic edge about its satirical subject, playing up the dark humor and downplaying the gore. No. Instead it was just a very bloody version of Clue with various killings and assorted weapons used by deranged members of this dysfunctional family in the conservatory or in the dining room. (Everyone, of course, has the poorest of aim, little vision, or any semblance of reality or character development. And now, I'm talking about the directors and its screenwriters. Let's place the blame directly at them: Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillert never find the right tone in this macabre mishmash and writers Guy Busick and Ryan Murphy only celebrate predictability with their contrived concept and just cannot create believable characters or clever dialog. The twist ending is more absurd than expected and a real letdown.)The actors range from deserving of better material to find another job ASAP. Samara Weaving (a Margot Robbie wannabe) plays Grace, the woeful bride. At least, this actress has some screen presence as does Mark O'Brien as Alex, the hapless groom. One actually pities this talented actors who deserve a better way to make a living, As Alex's brother, David, Adam Brody has his moments but is rather bland. From there, it gets worse: Henry Czerny, usually a fine character actor, is at his hammiest and has done far better work than this shlock suggests. That Andie MacDowell is part of this misfire only adds to the disappointment and confirms that what happens to actresses in their elder years does indeed qualify for elder abuse. Granted, the script is a mess and it is difficult to tell if it is the fault of the actors or the badly-written characters they play.The rest of the supporting cast is ghastly in their roles and they appear to come off as strictly amateurs in this movie. They all seem to be directed to perform like a live action Addams Family knock-offs without the make-up or wit, although Nicky Guadagni as Aunt Helene is cartoonish enough. (Some advice to all of the the ensemble: Your dedication to your craft is admirable. But, perhaps, your desperation to be a part of this biz we call show outweighs your better judgement. Ask yourself if you really want a film like this to be part of your legacy when doing your next venture. Plus, find a better agent.)For the record, Grace's white wedding gown turns a nice shade of deep crimson by the film's third act, if you care by then. (And those final scenes are unintentional laughable as the film veers into supernatural territory.) The body count continues to rise as servants and kin are dispatched with glee. The violence ranges from stabbings, impalements, beheadings, and gruesome shootings. The weapons include axes, cross-bows, rifles, pistols, and knives.How this movie merited some critical praise (and it did) is baffling! The suspense is nil, with nary a scare or a laugh, although the directors have an obsession for close-up gore and torture, believing that blood-drenched corpses gurgling their last gasps of life constitutes a horror film nowadays. Need I say more.Ready or Not is more not than ready. No RSVP is needed. Just avoid this wedding party at all costs.Ah, Autumn! Have you already forsaken me!","

"edicionccq","24 November 2019","""Ready or Not"" it's a weird movie. The movie is full of strange choices from the writers.
At first the movie starts really good. Excellent pacing, the plot is simple but it works, the jokes are funny and the fear is present. But the second half of the movie is just weird; there are a lot of changes in the way things developed. Some moments are so good for the horror aspect but then a joke appears all of a sudden. If you ignore the pacing of that half and the weird choice for the ending this is a good movie.The best parts of this movie are the characters. Every single one of them is pretty well established and the way they act is coherent with their personalities. Most of the characters, that we could consider the villains, are funny and has their reasons to do what they do and it's kind of convincing. The leading character is pretty good. You want her to win but also you want to see her suffer and fighting for his life. And believe, she will really fight for her life.The conclusion is ""Ready or Not"" is a weird black comedy with slasher. It contains gore and funny characters. The twists are decent and if you are into dark humor in killing, this will be good for you.","

"BandSAboutMovies","24 August 2019","Marriage - especially the ceremony itself - can be terrifying. The best horror movies take a frightening moment in our lives and show how ""what's the worst that can happen"" explodes outward into a spiraling miasma of sheer madness. In a year sadly bereft of many great - or even halfway decent - horror films, Ready Or Not has arrived to squarely punch you right in the face and spit blood in your eye.For generations, the wealthy Le Domas family has remained in power by conducting a ritual on the night that anyone new enters the family. Tonight, prodigal son Alex has returned home to marry Grace (the niece of Hugo Weaving, who also appeared in The Babysitter and Mayhem), an orphan who has been raised in foster homes.Years ago, the great-great-grandfather of the Le Domas family made a deal with Mr. Le Bail and the family must play one game - they're pretty much Hasbro in real life - at the end of the wedding ceremony. It could be something as simple as Old Maid. Yet it ends up being the worst card - Hide And Seek.Now, the entire Le Domas family is hunting down Grace, who only thinks that she's playing a game. Maid after maid gets caught in the crossfire and the entire extended family - children included - are armed, dangerous and after our heroine.Henry Czerny shines as Tony Le Domas, the crazed leader of the clan, and Andie McDowell is wonderful as his somewhat conflicted wife Becky. One of the relationships at the center of this film is between good brother Alex and bad sibling Daniel ((Adam Brody, Seth from The O.C.). Of course, this being horror, what is good and what is evil will change throughout this long night of the soul.There are parts of this film that aspire to be more than mere slasher or modern horror. That's a good thing. It may be me reading into things, but the scene where Grace escapes into the fields was reminiscent of the framing and pace of Suzy Kendall being chased in Sergio Martino's Torso. And without giving too much away, the close finally delivers on the levels of gore and supernatural menace that has been slowly hinted during the film's run time. Joyously, this feels like a movie with no dead spots, growing tighter and taunter as the slowly more blood-caked and torn wedding gown that Grace wears throughout.I have to single out Nicky Guadagni, who was in Cube, for her portrayal of Helena. The loss of her husband at the film's start has warped her into the twisted center of this family, despite what the male head would have you think. She's turned her loss into less than sacrifice and more of a reason for being. Drug addict sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano, the lead on SyFy's Wynonna Earp) is pretty great, too.So often, modern horror hasn't been certain how to combine humor and terror. Ready Or Not gets it right. Then again, I have a weird sense of humor, so I laughed joyously at moments that no one else found funny. Too bad - I would have preferred to see this in a much rougher theater than the comfortable place where it unspooled so that people would have been unafraid to scream and yell at the screen. After all, that's what movies are for.Ready Or Not was directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin (V/H/S) and Tyler Gillett (Devil's Due), who are part of the Radio Silence film collective. It was written by Guy Busick (Stan Against Evil) and Ryan Murphy (Minute's Until Midnight).I will spoil one part of the film. At the close, as Grace draws a drag of cigarette despite being covered in grime, gore, viscera and her own blood, there's an echo of a movie from the past, Heathers. That made me clap in the theater - despite the machinations of family, the man she loves and even fate, Grace is not going away without a fight. Her spirit is one that even the devil must sit up and take notice of - quite literally.","

"cappiethadog","29 January 2020","The rich are different, Daniel(Adam Brody) admits as much to Grace(Samara Weaving), his sister-in-law for all of half a day. Daniel doesn't have what it takes to be a satanist, or a capitalist, for that matter. He lacks the killer instinct. ""Ready or Not"", directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, updates the ideology behind Ernest B. Schoedsack and Irving Pichel's ""The Most Dangerous Game"", in which Grace, the hunted, is clearly marked as the proletariat; not a relativistic object, an animal chosen by the hunter(Count Zaroff, played by Leslie Banks in the 1932 original), which happens to be human, because the normal rules of engagement need not be abided by if you're outside civilization's jurisdiction. The rich make their own moral universe. But Daniel is moral. He discovers his brother's wife in the pool room. The moral brother gives Grace a ten-second running start before he alerts the others, starting with Tony(Henry Czernas), his father, who is adamant about keeping the family's bloodline blue. The newlywed should have paid closer attention the underlying warning of her hubby's warning. Before Alex(Mark O'Brien) and Grace read their wedding vows, the groom says: ""I'm giving you an out,"" to his bride, who misreads the warning as being money-related. Grace misses the part where Alex never cracks a smile to reassure her that his apprehension is a joke. The family tradition is more sinister than she can imagine. As children, Daniel hid Alex in a closet the last time somebody had the misfortune to draw the dreaded ""Hide and Seek"" card. It was their Aunt Helene's husband, who died in a ritual sacrifice, but not before Becky(Andie McDowell), the boys' mother, let fly a strategically-placed arrow from her bow like an expert archer that kept Charles(Andrew Anthony) alive for the interim. The aunt(Nicky Guadagni), whose mien is suggestive of the proverbial woman with a grudge, has been waiting years for a night like this. Like Rosemary Woodhouse(Mia Farrow), wife of Guy(John Cassavetes), a struggling actor in Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"", Grace's unwavering belief that Alex will deliver her from evil leads to disillusionment. Although bad blood with his family led Alex to flee the LaDomas dominion, in the end, blood turns out to be thicker than water, as they say, because the gaming empire family's blood is bad, especially, the blood of the black sheep.Daniel was slightly taller than Alex on that fateful night. You could say that he was the ""high boy"", running interference between Alex and the destiny he'll learn of on his wedding night. A high boy, in the furniture sense of the word, in ""Rosemary's Baby"", has been moved. Mr. Nicklas(Elisha Cook), the Bramford apartment building landlord, stands aghast; he knows that a hall closet exists behind the hulking cabinet. Guy rubs his face, as if annoyed at the old man for being so observant. But isn't this the first time he laid eyes on this place? Rosemary points at the outline. This annoys Guy, too. Rosemary would never guess that her husband's exasperation pertains not just to the landlord, who enlists him as a furniture mover, but because her deducing skills make them collaborators against a conspiracy plot that will become self-evident in the near-future. Landlord and wife have no idea what they just stumbled upon. The question of whether Guy's association with the cultists began that night as dinner guests of their neighbors, the Castevets(Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon), or a long-standing one which resumed after a lengthy hiatus, was an open-ended one. Arguably, ""Ready or Not"" resolves this ambiguity, due to the film's resemblance in form and content. Guy knows Roman Castenet and his wife Minnie. He also knows about the ghastly history of that gothic piece of 19th century architecture. Hutch(Maurice Evans), their old landlord, is only wasting his breath. Like Grace's husband, Guy probably wanted a normal life. Slitting goat necks, a LaDomas family tradition since grandfather cut a deal with fellow traveler LeBail, the devil in disguise, chased Alex away, but relative poverty brought the prodigal son back to the fold, gambling that Grace wouldn't pull the bad card. Being one of the common people didn't suit him. Slitting goat necks notwithstanding, satanism is a necessary evil Alex willingly accepts as the cost of being a trustee to the family fortune. Faustian pacts are nefarious deals, naughty by nature, that are made to either procure money, or in the case of ""Rosemary's Baby"", fame; two drugs more potent than love, and worth killing over, for some. Guy, as well, ventured out on his own, wanting to prove himself as a stage actor with the right stuff, all the while knowing that if he couldn't establish himself legitimately, enlisting the help of Roman Castevet and his dark arts as a last resort was an option. An actor, the man who beat Guy out for the starring role in a play, goes blind suddenly, and the play's director calls his second choice to see if he'd be interested. As payment, the husband promises the cultists a baby, albeit with some acquiescence. A son, born stillborn, Rosemary is told, she refutes, not after the sound of crying comes emitting through those thin walls on a nightly basis. The dislocated high boy, refashioned into a barricade, Rosemary remembers, then quickly diagnoses, must block a secret passageway to her next-door satanists.Emilie LaDomas(Melanie Scrofano), already on the hook for two accidental kills; a governess and maid, makes it a trifecta of collateral damage when she shoots Daniel, her good brother. Without his ""tall boy"", Alex comes out of the closet, so to speak, and learns the truth about what sort of devilry he's up against, like Rosemary. She can tell by looking at her son's eyes that Guy isn't the father: Lucifer is. On the night of the impregnation ceremony, when that dessert with the chalky undertaste Minnie laced with drugs starts to have an effect on Rosemary's cognitive functions, Guy mocks his wife for added dissonance, relaying news from the black and white television about the pope's visit to Yankee Stadium. Rosemary is Catholic. His words are coded: Your god can't help you. The go-between can't help you. The Richard Connell short story ""The Hounds of Zaroff"", adapted into ""The Most Dangerous Game"" for the screen, is applicable. Guy could be a stand-in for the Count, who hunts her in baroque fashion. No bow and arrow, no gun: Guy depends on Rosemary's unconditional love for him as a weapon. The old men and women, nude throughout Adrian's conception, are the hounds. Does she fight back? No. Love is the most dangerous game. Rosemary joins the cult, agreeing with Roman that she should ""be a real mother"" to her half-humanoid son. God or Lucifer, Rosemary doesn't really choose either one. What ""Rosemary's Baby"" conveys is that she's possessed by her husband, choosing his obtuse convolutions to isolate her against the practical advice of cosmopolitan girlfriends, who all agree that Dr. Saperstein(Ralph Bellamy) is a quack. Go to Dr. Hill(Charles Grodin) they persist. But the internal physical pain, no matter how intense, because of her religiosity, the satanists know that Rosemary, their human game, will no doubt carry the little devil to full-term. Grace, on the other hand, despite her name, is a secularist; a position, guessed at, since the potty-mouthed young woman expresses no misgivings about her wedding being held outside the sanctity of a church. Since Becky, the groom's mother, gave birth to her husband, LeBail's heir apparent, the ""new me"", a moniker, previously though to have referenced the two women's shared experience of coming from humble stock, now means, the audience realizes, that the child she dams will carry the title of ""Grace's Baby"", second in succession to the LaDomas fortune and the throne of a fallen angel. With Daniel no longer alive to protect his younger brother, Alex learns that it was always his destiny to lead the family, which involves more than sitting goat necks. He has to sacrifice Grace. Does she fight back. Hell, yeah.Bob(Joel McCrea), the lone survivor of a yacht explosion at sea, makes it ashore on a small island overseen by a madman, in ""The Most Dangerous Game"", proving once again that the rich are different. Bob, a published author, who writes books about big game hunting, leads Count Zaroff to believe he has found a kindred spirit; a teammate instead of opponent. Zaroff, a Bolshevik, who owns the private island, dangles the proposition of hunting his two remaining guests: Martin(Robert Armstrong) and his sister Eve(Fay Wray). Bob flatly turns down the offer. Count Zaroff calls this game ""outdoor chess"" when it's Bob and Eve's turn to play. Bob gets a knife. Eve gets nothing to counter their common enemy. This outdoor chess Zaroff invented is a game meant for two human animals, mano a mano. The Count deeming Bob as a formidable opponent. With the woman, he's playing checkers.""I will play the ***t out of checkers,"" Grace declares before she goes downstairs. By the break of dawn, she gets to the other side of the board. The winner doesn't say: ""King me,"" but that's exactly what Grace does.","

Usually the game is harmless, but Grace pulls out ""Hide and Seek"", which means her in-laws are supposed to hunt her down and murder her before sunrise...READY OR NOT Is a tongue in cheek horror movie, as satirical as it is terrifying. Playing with the concept of murderous in-laws it shows to what extreme one has to go through to belong to a new family. Samara Weaver fills the shoes of a fragile heroine who quickly learns survival skills in a labyrinthine gothic mansion, when like many newly weds she realises there's no happily ever after.The film has a perfect pacing and a great cast, each of them with some memorable idiosyncrasies that make them very much alive. Adam Brody, a divided brother of the groom is a show stealer, and Andy MacDowell shines as the family matriarch and a reluctant killer. Her character's transformation in the film is the most interesting one.The soundtrack by Bryan Tyler is incredible and is the heart and soul of the film. It also makes a great stand alone listen.READY OR NOT has enough suspense murders and gore to satisfy a seasoned horror movie lover and its cleverness is what makes you talk after the credits finish rolling.

Amazing camerawork, lighting and performances by the lead actors especially Samara Weaving makes this movie a memorable one.

"Larsii90","5 January 2020","Despite some predictable moments and dumb decitions I enjoyed it. Creepy and fun premise, setting, good cast and characters and great acting. It was twisted, gory and went in new directions several times. It kept me guessing and I would recommend it. Something different! Sadly you can't expect horror flicks to be good anymore, but this surprised me!","

"ThomasDrufke","4 September 2019","A great trailer can really shape your expectations about a movie. What was initially thought of (and pitched) as merely a hide and seek horror film, there was no real reason to get excited about Ready or Not. But oh boy did that trailer (and the marketing campaign overall) completely shift my hopes for the film. And luckily, the film is exactly what the marketing presents, endlessly fun, at times hilarious, and a devilishly delightful thriller vibe throughout. Oh, and Samara Weaving is an absolute star in the making, and far better than Margot Robbie 1a, which is what I initially referred to her as. One of the best films of the year, and a great way to end the summer.9.0/10","

I finished 1 min ago and I have to write my comment immediatelly , that was the most absurd , zero logical funny gore movie in my life , I laughed too much really. I dont understand Samara Weaving plays always in horror movies like that :) she is so nice , I love her. Also I love other characters in the movie. Anyway I gave 7 because it is hilarious watchable without too much expectation . I don't know why but these amount of bloods in the movie like that make me laugh . ( this is so stupid .I know ) It is so fake .. one comment starts like ""silly, really silly but it was good"" I totally agree with this... last sentence about movie : wedding dress was really good.","

You think you're ready, but you're not, it's wild. Weaving does a great job as the main character, she's put through her paces and just keeps moving (and looks pretty badass doing it!). I really enjoyed the quirky nature of the dialogue and acting. You're laughing one minute, then gasping the next. They make no bones about the premise and each character plays their part beautifully. The ending is a bit weird, but in context it couldn't have ended any better. Really something.","

"Groverdox","23 December 2019","""Ready or Not"" is one of those movies you don't need to watch. If you know what it's about, you can pretty much imagine the whole thing. You've probably got an imagination at least as good as the filmmakers'.I only really watched the movie for the beautiful Miss Weaving, and I'm not sure if her character really made it worth watching. It was also pretty cool seeing Andie McDowell as a villain.But other than that, I was just waiting for it to end. Even the movie's sub-par gore is predictable. What a surprise, for example, that the protagonist suffers a wound mid way, that would probably see her bleed to death within moments in real life... and then goes the rest of the movie with it without even fainting from loss of blood.The movie is born to be a thriller in the Agatha Christie mould but makes a final, misguided detour into horror movie territory in the final act, as though the filmmakers realised they needed to somehow justify the movie's ridiculous premise, and only the supernatural could really do that.It seems like it was made up as they went along, which makes it a waste of their time, as well as ours.","

"JohnDeSando","4 September 2019","""Till death do us part.""I could have avoided one of my failed marriage if I had never married into her family in the first place. However, at that time, I never thought to look at the family to see the warning signs.In Ready or Not, young Grace (Samara Weaving) is ready to marry Alex (Mark O'Brien) not knowing the La Domas family, although their being super wealthy from board games might help her over the ignorance. As they are scheduled to play an initiation game of Hide and Seek for her, it becomes clear it's deadly enough to demand her life before dawn or they all die.Elements of Get Out, Clue, and Rosemary's Baby help make Ready or Not one of the best horror movies of the year with a little scare for everyone. If an audience is interested in blood and surprise, with a slight bit of the supernatural, then this macabre fest is for them.If, however, like me, an audience looks for social and cultural commentary in addition to the scares, then this nervous experience more than fulfills that requirement. The film shows two ways a bride should be on alert: 1. Wealth has a way of making the wealthy unpredictable, self-centered, and wicked. 2. Why a fiancé has estranged himself from his family is an important piece of information that may save a bride's life.The usual jump-scare tropes and malicious surprises make Ready or Not a delight for the normal horror fan. The cautionary-tale about knowing thy fiancé's family is universally true here. The over-the-top gore that induces laughs makes this film a joy to any filmgoer who can suspend disbelief and love this genre for its ability to teach about life's ironies and dark sides.","

"kirbylee70-599-526179","17 December 2019","A number of movies that once qualified to be called thrillers now fall under the guise of horror films. These films have viewers on the edge of their seats waiting to see what will take place, filled with jumps and scares aplenty. What makes them horror films are the morbid things that take place in the film. READY OR NOT is such a film.Former foster child Grace (Samara Weaving) marries into the Le Domas family after a whirlwind 18 month romance with son Alex (Mark O'Brien). Alex has been estranged from his wealthy family for some time now. They return to the family home for their marriage and all seems to be going well. Until the evening of the wedding Grace learns of something unexpected.The Le Domas family has made their wealth from the gaming industry. Begun years ago by Victor le Domas, he was provided with funds to start the company by a mysterious benefactor named Le Bail. Victor left behind a mysterious box and a demand of his family. When someone marries into the family they must play a game, determined by a card that the draw from the box. After hearing the story Grace draws her card and the game chosen is hide and seek.Grace runs off to hide with no idea of what is actually about to transpire. The family believes that if they don't follow the game to its end something terrible will transpire. What they haven't bothered telling Grace is that this game of hide and seek involves hunting her with weapons, the object to kill her before sunrise. If she survives, things move forward.As Grace hides the family arm themselves with various weapons. For most of them this is something new they've never experienced. While some are skilled others have no clue how to use the weapons they've been given. This becomes apparent when one of the family members is killed by mistake.A change in the game takes place when Grace is located by her husband Alex. He tells her what is going on and explains to her the object of the game. With his help the pair are hoping to survive the night and move on to become a happy couple. But with the number of family members hunting the odds are not in their favor.The movie sounds like a simple plot but is filled with tons of things that make it worth watching, in particular the dark comedy that many of the sequences lend themselves to. In particular is Aunt Helene who has a scowl on her face from start to finish. She seems the most suited for the role of hunting and seems to take relish in what transpires. What she does to the help is guaranteed to provide a laugh for those with an offbeat sense of humor.Another funny moments has the family arguing about whether or not to use the security cameras seen throughout the house. The cameras are not to be used during the game but once the first person is killed they think twice about using them. Aunt Helene complains telling them they have no sense of tradition.The film has a wonderful look to it, a sort of brownish haze that adds to the atmosphere of the film. The sets are amazing with a fantastic looking old style mansion for the events to take place in. The cinematography is also extremely well done allowing scenes in the dark just enough light for things taking place to be seen, a problem with many movies that take place at night.The acting here is wonderful as well with each character turning in wonderful performances. To be able to play these roles with a straight face takes some acting chops. Perhaps outstanding among them is Henry Czerny as the head of the family. His ability to play his role as serious as he does while in the face of absurdity is hilarious. Samara Weaving as Grace is worthwhile too, showing the right amount of shock and resilience the role requires. And Andie McDowell is fantastic in the role of the mother here, a role that most would never expect her to play.READY OR NOT is not the type of movie that everyone will have fun with but if your sense of humor runs the dark side then this will be a movie not to miss. It's gruesome and funny at the same time and that for me is something that rarely works. This time it does.","

"vengeance20","2 September 2019","Just seen this tonight at a Scream Unseen event at my local cinema & found it an epic watch!The films story-line is simple. A young woman, Grace, marry s into a rich family who have an annual tradition in which any new family member must play a game at midnight in order to seal the deal in a sense. But Grace picks that one game, Hide & Seek, she at first laughs & plays along but then soon realises its not the typical innocent game she thought it was. The rest of the film sees Grace in a fight for survival as she becomes caught in a deadly game of cat & mouse.I already knew what the film was going be like story-line wise, the trailer gives that away in the first 20 seconds alone. But what the twist of the film was going to be & how violent, was yet to be seen!It's rare in cinema now that you get an 18+ at all, never mind an 18+ horror! This film didn't disappoint & kept me locked from start to finish! The gore & kills were epic & didn't cease to amaze me! The humour was funny too, though I wouldn't say there was enough in it to justify the ""Black Comedy"" genre as it was mostly serious than anything else.The ending however though gory was a little half & half, but you'll have to see for yourself in order to know where I'm coming from with that one...!But overall this film was a nice 100 minute gory fest that reminds me of The Purge mixed with Downton Abbey! 9/10","

This is actually something I'll watch again, even though I know how it ends.For the life of me, I can't understand how anybody who read the description of this movie and then watched it, could give it a low rating. It's EXACTLY as described, but better. It doesn't make the mistake of lumbering on for 2 hours, but is a quick watch.A note for violence: some reviews comment that it is extremely gory. I did not find this to be the case. It is quite bloody, but for the most part, it's tame enough to allow folks who can't handle tons of gore to watch it, but meaty enough for gorehounds to enjoy it. I would always prefer gnarly amounts of viscera, but it was still a super fun romp of a flick. For what it was meant to be, the writer and director nailed it.","

"Wililjam","30 November 2019","I didn't really go into this film with a lot of expectations of what it was going to be, and there weren't a lot of recognizable actors in the movie, but holy crap this is a good one.The film has a bit of everything sprinkled it in, but everything works. I laughed a hell of a lot, and all of the humor in it is kind of dark, but it works very well. There's a lot of scary moments, but not really any jump scares which is good. Scary films, at least recently, have relied way too much on jump scares. This one doesn't, and it's still scary. But the film balances the horror and humor very well.Why it all works is because of the actors. They're all amazing, actually, especially the main actress Samara Weaving. I don't think I've ever seen a performance as realistic as hers. She can really act like she's scared, and her screams are top-notch.Honestly, I would love to see a prequel, or a sequel that delves deeper into the mythology of it all. I would definitely recommend this to everyone who loves horror and/or dark humor. It's a refreshing horror film, so go watch it!","

"tabuno","9 September 2019","In the same style as Kate Winslet's The Dressmaker (2016) and Nicole Kidman's Dogville (2004), this very dark comedy horror movie maintains the difficult balance between grotesque and weirdly appealing immorality of evil death. The script and director successfully maintain a difficult but nicely paced movie along with an amazing absence of overly imbued supernatural features. Instead Ready or Not holds the audience attention more for its humanness than monsterness. The lead character played by Samara Weaving is allowed to perform with a more realistic and Hitchcockian motif using scary elements of timing, audience expectation, well-deserved cinematography, and music to create a technically well-crafted scary movie. For the most part, the movie is well-tied together with a compelling sprinkle of twists and delicious sordidness. Except for perhaps a tinge of the loss of the fun balance of darkness and comedy towards the last half of the movie, it still ends with a nice sense of humor","

"Pairic","2 October 2019","Ready Or Not: A Black Comedy Horror film with the comedy fading at times due to the brutality of the killings. Grace (Samantha Weaving) is marrying into the wealthy Le Domas family. On her wedding night she participates in a family ritual, drawing a card from a box to decide on the game to be played. She chooses Hide & Seek. Soon she is fighting for her life. An ancestor of the Le Domas family had made a deal with Mr Le Bail (the Devil) which brought him great wealth- at a cost.A gruesome chase ensues with maid's being accidentally shot with crossbows and crushed in dumbwaiters. The resulting injuries are starkly displayed and it would have taken just a few changes in the script to transform this from comedy to outright horror. The family engage in Satan worship and sacrifice goats as well as those new family members who choose a fatal game. Even children participate in the hunt.Samantha Weaving delivers a tour de force performance as she faces an onslaught of knives, bullets arrows and axes. .Very dark humour and horror combine to create an entertaining film. Ably directed by Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin who were also at the helm of Southbound and Devil's Due. 8/10.","

"Abdulxoxo","14 January 2021","From the trailer I thought this film looked tedious, kinda B-ish with poor acting but gladly I was wrong. Ready or Not is a decent thriller flick, and it manages to cross genres to great effect. There are action sequences, horror sequences and even some black humour. I felt tense when I was meant to. I wriggled at all the gory scenes when I meant to. Hell, I was even laughing at the dark humour, which I'm sure will not appeal to everyone. The way the screenplay sets up how and why this family is trying to kill Grace is actually really well thought out. This is a bloody, violent movie with some hilarious swearing; and I like that they didn't hold anything back.
The production design on this movie is superb. The look of the mansion and all the old weaponry work really well. The lighting is also fantastic. In addition I like the score. it has that rhythm that helps add tension to a horror movie, but in a way it also sounds sort of playful, like the children's game they are playing. In terms of the acting, everyone across the board does a great job. Samara Weaving is excellent in the lead role. Pretty much every member of the Le Domas family has a distinct personality and give a fun performance. Adam Brody's lack of interest is a constant highlight. Scrofano is there for the slapstick humour. Guadagni is just plain old scary. Her look, as well as attitude to family tradition, is just terrifying. Overall, this film is very entertaining and thrilling, and I had a good time watching it.","

"Kirpianuscus","19 July 2023","I wanted see this film after I saw its trailer. For actors, off course, for supposition to be a solid horror with some Gothic touch.And, indeed, after its end, easy to define it as ""modest"" but far to be a dessapointment.Good premises and few serious fists of naive humor.Unrealistic situations and a final reminding classic B movies.And Samara Weaving offering a role of surviver who transforms the poor Rambo in simplistic sketch. But the real star is Nicky Guadagni in a role reminding some Addams family.So, pleasant, because it is just nice to see Adam Brody as the good brother, Andie McDowel as mother between so opposite feelings, Henry Czerny as a father of family preocuped by an old ritual, a lot of blood, a burned house and bodies becoming a sort of popcorn.The real god - good- good detail- the wedding dress for who the compassion is just fair. And, sure, an eccentric entry in husband family or a pure manifesto against marriage behind a serious investigation about relatives of beloved one.","

I also wasnt really expecting that ending, but I loved it and thought it was so over-the-top and perfect for this story. Also, I really liked Adam Brody in this, I did feel more for his character more than the main character played by Samara Weaving (and maybe thats a slight problem) but its still an overall plus in my book. But speaking of the main character or final girl as you will, as she wasnt as badass/capable as I was hoping her to be. Its not like shes dumb necessarily, but I feel like she only survives for so long because the family has stormtrooper aim. There was a couple of moments here and there where the comedy was a bit much but overall I did really enjoy this film.","

"bowmanblue","12 July 2020","Sometimes a film is generally known as one thing, but - in reality - is totally something else. It would be easy to lump 'Ready or Not' in the 'horror' category and, yes, it does have numerous elements associated with the genre. However, it's so much more. And, by 'more' I mean better... and funny (in the darkest possible way!).I remember thinking that a lot of the best films (horror or otherwise) that seemed to be made in the eighties got going very early. They didn't waste any time with redundant plot details and allowed the audience to grow with the story and characters. 'Ready or Not' does this by kicking off with everything you need to know in the first ten minutes or so. A young woman has returned to her husband-to-be's luxurious family home in order to marry him in front of his - slightly aloof - family.All goes well until after the ceremony where he informs her that it's tradition that any newcomers to the bloodline must play 'a game.' She picks out the age old classic 'Hide and Seek.' A chance choice she soon learns to regret, as this involves the family hunting her down throughout the mansion with an assortment of weapons in order to slay her.'Ready or Not' could just have been some random horror-hunt film, but the main reason to watch isn't anything to do with viewing a film that will scare you, but simply to entertain. And it does this using 'black comedy' at every turn. Yes, the family are evil murderers, but they're just so damn funny that you can't help but enjoy their performance. Plus Samara Weaving is excellent as the main character, proving that strong female leads can still exist without turning them into some sort of 'Mary Sue' trope.It's not that long in length and the runtime flies by with a mix of gore (also played for laughs in many cases!) and an awesome script which is simply there to entertain the audience. If you like your gore mixed with very dark humour you really do have to watch this one. It's a modern classic and I hope they don't make a franchise out of this because it's perfect the way it is.","

"I_Ailurophile","16 September 2022","One could wax poetically for many paragraphs about the fantastic filming locations, or the production design and art direction that enrich these spaces. We could go over the excellent hair and makeup work and costume design, delightful props and weapons, and fabulous blood and gore. It's worth reflecting on the terrific music of Brian Tyler that ranges from innocent nothings, to cheeky rearrangements, to fantastic, charged themes that lend to the tension, suspense, and scenes of action. Those action scenes are executed with outstanding vibrancy, and the stunts and effects look great. Cinematography, editing, lighting, and the production values generally are very sharp, and skilled directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett capably spotlight every little detail. The cast (what a cast!) is tremendous just for the names and faces, to say nothing of the phenomenal acting they all offer up. Samara Weaving stands out most of all, naturally, as protagonist Grace, showcasing exceptional range and physicality that makes her the perfect action-horror heroine. I'm also partial to Melanie Scrofano, who made such a big impression in 'Wynonna Earp,' and her turn here as Emilie is pure comedic joy. All this is to say nothing of Henry Czerny, Nicky Guadagni, Andie MacDowell, Mark O'Brien, Elyse Levesque, and all others on hand who bring the picture to life with incredible vitality.All this is well and good and true, and it's worth discussing every last element of the movie. But most importantly - 'Ready or not' is devilishly fun!Utmost commendations to screenwriters Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy, for their screenplay is utterly stupendous. It's strongly balanced and penned with extraordinary finesse. The action is tight and invigorating, the horror is gnarly and cringe-worthy, and the comedy is as consistently funny as it is dark. Yet beyond these there are also strong themes and emotional beats that provide earnest weight to the proceedings, not least of all persistent questions about Alex's feelings, the situation that the Le Domas family is trapped in, and their perspectives on it. All this leads to a delicious variety of moods in the scene writing and dialogue as every last strain is twisted together with marvelous fluidity. Characters are written with diverse personalities, and the narrative as a whole is wonderfully compelling, and satisfying. When horror gets blended with other genres sometimes the mix doesn't always turn out quite right, but this a shining example of how, when every facet is given its time and place, keen minds can bear superb fruit.Provided one has no objections to substantial graphic violence, I can't imagine anyone I wouldn't recommend this to. Each composite aspect is realized with gratifying care and intelligence - no part is given any less treatment than another - and the result is that 'Ready or not' is is an absolute blast. If you've already watched it, it's worth watching again; if you haven't had the chance yet - well, what are you waiting for?","

"ccamp89","27 August 2019","I typically enjoy schlocky horror-comedies a la Drag Me To Hell or The Cabin in the Woods, but Ready or Not just didn't quite do it for me. It has a neat premise that toys with ideas of class, privilege, and entitlement all while, of course, reveling in comic absurdity and bloodshed. It doesn't have anything particularly insightful to say but hey, I'll take a novel premise over another Annabelle copy-and-paste job any day, regardless of how shallow the subtext. My issues, then, lie more in its execution: the cartoony and somewhat irritating quality of the characters, the limpness of the humor, and the lack of memorable set pieces. I walked away from the other two aforementioned films with a head full of stand-out gags and striking images. Here, the experience largely blended together and slipped by without truly shocking, scaring, or amusing me. Perhaps that's the fault of the direction, which is so crucial in translating a good premise into a kinetic, absorbing, and visually compelling film. Still, I can see why others may enjoy this and I do appreciate the original and playfully-executed concept. Perhaps it just wasn't my cup of tea.Strong 2.5/5","

"Pumpkin_Man","5 September 2019","I really had fun with this dark horror comedy. It reminds me of the story 'The Most Dangerous Game' where the hunter is hunting down real people. Some could say it's also similar to Rob Zombie's 31. It wasn't until the last act that I started smiling and laughing like a psycho and fell in love with it because of it's sheer ridiculous over the top gore, violence, and blood. Lots of blood!!Alex Le Domas comes from a mega rich family, and he's set to marry the love of his life, Grace. After the Wedding, Grace must take part in an old family tradition. She must play a game with them. Unfortunately, she has to play 'hide and seek' She has to hide while his family finds her. She has until dawn. Soon enough, she realizes that it's not just a game, they all mean to kill her!Throughout the night, Grace tries to survive by any means necessary. She even turns the tables and starts fighting back. Will this bride be able to survive her bloody Wedding night? I highly recommend READY OR NOT!!!","

"justinwfirestone","13 September 2019","At a parsimonious 91 minutes, Ready or Not is about half as much of a movie as It Chapter Two, which trundles in at an unceremonious 169 minutes. If you consider the ticket was purchased with a student ID for a discount and a free 44oz. popcorn with buttery topping, it's safe to say Ready or Not is the clear winner of this summer's Battle for Your Dark Comedy Hard-earned Bucks.What if you were dirt poor and wanted to become rich through marriage to a family so wealthy they could kill some people now and then and not have any repercussions, either moral, ethical, or legal? It might involve sacrificing some of your own morality or sense of ethics, perhaps even a deal with the devil, as you learn more about what it takes to become part of an elite ruling class, with little to worry about other than what bottle of wine to quaff next.It's a slight gore-fest, but nothing nasty like a Saw flick or a Hostel pic. It might even be a more feminist statement than Mad Max: Fury Road, and for a dark comedy, it has a relatively bright ending.","

The pace is good not running out of steam. Kept me interested till the end. It's also nice not to see monsters and zombies for a change.
Samara Weaving as the new daughter in law isn't stunningly beautiful which makes her right for the role. Adam Brody is likeable. Andie Macdowell suits the role of Mother in law in a Morticia like way.

'Ready or Not' is satirical, funny, and entertaining. I especially like the fact that the female protagonist is a smart, courageous, and daring fighter, and Weaving truly delivers all the characteristics with the right amount of comics and charisma. How the directors play with the timing of events in the process is genius. Finally, a MUSIC director definitely needs praise. Solely music changes the nuance from horror to thriller to comedy: the best element of the movie.","

"BJG-Reviews","5 December 2019","The stage curtains open ...Well, that was different. ""Ready Or Not"" already gets high marks for originality. It is more than just a movie about survival, love, betrayal, family, tradition, or marriage. Actually, yeah it is - all of the above. It is surprisingly deep with characterization and plot. It is a gory, good time.It is Grace's wedding day. She found a good catch with Alex, who belongs to an extremely wealthy family - a family that abounds with eccentricities. Everyone is thrilled to have her joining them and the wedding is beautiful. There is just one small detail that her new husband failed to tell her. At the stroke of midnight, on their wedding night, she needs to play a game. It is, after all, family tradition! She agrees and she draws the game of Hide & Seek. Before she knows it, she is running for her life from the very family that welcomed her in with open arms.This movie grabs you pretty much from the get-go and doesn't let go. It is paced very well, moving along at a good clip, effectively holding your attention until the explosive ending (and I use that term liberally). The acting is right on the money, the special effects and cinematography well executed, and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you wondering what in the world is going on and why.I highly recommend ""Ready Or Not"". It delivers on all counts, albeit with some over-the-top moments, but still fitting to the story. It is fun, fast and furious in it's own right with plenty of gore and blood to keep even the most picky horror fans happy. I loved this one. 9 stars out of 10.","

"gwnightscream","29 November 2019","This 2019 comedy-thriller stars Samara Weaving, Mark O'Brien and Adam Brody. Weaving (The babysitter) plays young woman, Grace who marries wealthy guy, Alex (O'Brien). After the wedding, Grace is invited to participate in a traditional yet lethal game for those who come into the family. She finds herself in a nightmare and discovers that her in-laws are unhinged.
Brody plays Alex's brother, Daniel and Andie MacDowell (Groundhog Day) and Henry Czerny (Mission: Impossible) are also featured. This is a pretty good flick that sort of resembles ""Clue"" with suspense, gore and humor. The beautiful, Weaving is not only good in here, but also reminds me a little of Margot Robbie. Give this one a view if you like thrillers or dark comedies.","

"CANpatbuck3664","7 October 2019","I didn't know what to expect from Ready or Not but while I ended up being very impressed by the end, I wasn't on board at the start. The movie has a serious open with another new addition to the family ""playing the game"" and while the movie gets a little lighter when they shift to present day, it still lacked fun elements. They don't establish as many rules or alternatives for the premise as they should (probably my biggest gripe) and the idea of the hunt for Grace seems half-baked. But with an unexpected death, the movie makes a decision and goes a different route. This was what pulled me back in, the shift to make it a comedy was the correct one. There are very dark moments in this movie (I liked how they set up the mythology of the Le Domas family) but you are never far away from something that will make you laugh. If you aren't easily shocked or you love horror movies, there's some really funny stuff in here and it's the reason to go see this movie.Samara Weaving is on the rise, she was the only good aspect of The Babysitter (which was an attempt at a horror/comedy that missed the mark completely) and she had a brief appearance in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. She's a great heroine here, she can elicit sympathy in the dramatic moments but she was also really funny in those darkly comedic bits. She's a great asset to this movie and she shines. I think this will be a stepping stone to bigger things for her and with how excellent she was in this movie, if they decide to shoot a sequel, they should definitely bring her back.With Samara Weaving giving such a strong performance as the lead, the supporting cast is left to fill in the blanks. The family makes for a decent group of antagonists, the biggest name in the supporting cast is either Adam Brody or Andie McDowell. Brody is a better actor than he's given credit for, his character is complicated and I think Brody does a solid job of selling that. Andie is fine, she's a little wooden but she does a better job than I expected her to. My favourite was Melanie Scrofano (who I know as Bonnie McMurray in the hilarious show Letterkenny) as family screwup Emilie, she's over-the-top but she got some good laughs from me. Ditto for Kristian Braun for play Fitch. Mark O'Brien, Elyse Levesque and Henry Czerny round out the rest of the main players and they all do a solid job.Ready or Not goes through plenty of twists and turns to get to the end, some work better than others but I didn't have any problem going along with it. The ending pulls a nice bait and switch and then the creative team pushes all of their chips into pot. The final 5 minutes features some big finishes that aren't revolutionary but they had me giggling with what they chose to do. It was an interesting call but minus it taking the edge off the previous couple of scenes, it largely works.Ready or Not represented a different type of experience for me. When I go see a movie, I usually have watched the trailer, read or listened to a couple of reviews and investigated what I'm committing a couple of hours to (give or take a couple of minutes). I had heard the basic premise (which I didn't think was spectacular) but when I went to see this with a friend, we went in cold. I had seen it was well reviewed but having that fresh perspective really helped me enjoy it. Ready or Not was such a pleasant surprise and if your sense of humour skews towards a darker sensibility, I think it will be your cup of tea too. Its really funny, Samara Weaving is a great heroine, she's funny yet I was invested in her making it to the end. The supporting cast hits the right notes in helping the movie remain entertaining and I liked that they went all out with the ending. They don't pull punches and while it was surprisingly wacky, I liked the direction they went. Ready or Not doesn't hit the high that comparable horror/comedy Happy Death Day but this is a good alternative that is worth a watch. If I wasn't so late getting the review up, I'd definitely recommend seeing it in theatres but considering the time that lapsed, check this out on your preferred streaming service when it becomes available.","

"dfranzen70","5 December 2019","I realize that a lot of people have seen the more-recent Knives Out, which has a similar plot (rich people, big mansion, murder), but those similarities are superficial. Ready or Not is much more in the vein of You're Next, a family gathering gone awry, a horror movie with spots of comedic activity, and just as bloody. Here, Grace (Samara Weaving), having just married Alex (Mark O'Brien) at his super-rich family's super-big house, learns on her wedding night that she must play a game in order to be accepted into the family. The game is chosen through mystic randomness, and previous players have selected games like chess and Old Maid. Grace, though, gets Hide and Seek. Sounds like a fun game to play, especially in such a large building that's filled with tons of nooks, crannies, dumbwaiters, smart waiters, you name it. But it's not meant to be fun, as we soon find out - the family members, while Grace innocently hides, arm themselves with rifles, handguns, knives, and even a crossbow. How can she win? Grace wonders. Last until daylight, she's told. Good luck with that! The upsides of this movie far outweigh its main problem, that there's a real lack of chemistry between Weaving and O'Brien. The supporting cast is fine, but Andie McDowell, playing Alex's mother, is a real standout; it's a lot of fun to see the star of Groundhog Day and sex, lies, and videotape in a real horror movie, and she steals every scene with a commanding performance. And there's just enough humor to counteract some of the darker themes and scenes, particularly in the final act.","

"kannibalcorpsegrinder","29 December 2019","Preparing to marry into a wealthy family, a bride learns of a tradition on the wedding night where they're going to play a game with the family, and upon learning they're to play hide-and-seek realizes there's a far deadlier secret motivation for the choice of games and tries to survive the family night.For the most part, this one was an absolute blast. Among the many positives here is the buy-in of such a ludicrous premise into being a believable part of the family's history. That the film is concerned early on with the secretive nature of the family tradition that they have to play in order to be accepted gives the film a deep backstory. The history lesson that tells of the history that explains how it all started as well as the continuous notions to stay on tradition hunting everyone with classic weapons and techniques speaks to the family's status and secret nature rather well. That leads into the titular game itself, which is an absolute high-energy blast that mixes together the ludicrous premise with fun action. That they're chasing her around the house as she's unaware of the true nature of what they're hunting her for gives the first few scenes a sense of crazy over-the-top work where they go around shooting at each other, wielding crossbows and trying to chop her to pieces provides some crazy visuals. The confrontations become quite fun as there are encounters in the secret catacombs of the house, in various game rooms and meeting parlors or outside on the estate grounds that showcase not only luck on her part to survive but also plenty of drive and determination to do so. In addition, there's a wicked sense of humor to come from these encounters and situations that gives the film a sense of fun. The general premise of hunting an oblivious woman in order to prepare her for a Satanic sacrifice allows this one to offer up some fun where they mistake each other for the target and get killed accidentally to where the reactions after-the-fact generate some funny moments. There are also the hysterical smart-aleck comebacks and quips that are featured here which provide this one with several fine chuckles as well, leaving this one to have enough to like here with the mixture of goofy comedy to alleviate the serious nature of the hunting. That leaves the finale as the main troublesome spot of the film which seems to be simply an individual basis. Due to the family's desire to capture her alive rather than outright killer her, the finale devolves into a series of scenes knocking her out only to drag her into the altar room for the ritual where she escapes and forcing the chase again. It feels repetitive and completely highlights the ending resolution which is a massive cheat and utter letdown. Taking a realistic but unsatisfactory course of action where she's completely passive and not responsible is a cop-out of the highest order, despite the wild action featured which might make some forgive this one. However, it's really the only area where this one approaches a flaw.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.","

It wasn't a scary movie and there weren't any jumpscares, but it was super funny and I laughed so hard. The casting was nice and their acting was really good, especially Samara Weaving. Also, the cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie were both nice. It was a really intense movie from start to finish and there were too many action filled scenes.

"Cinema-reviewer321","22 June 2023","I did not know what I was going to expect from a movie that is like a more deadly game of hide and seek that starred Samara Weaving, but since I like Samara Weaving, I wanted to check it out. I had a fun time Ready or Not (2019), and thought it was a good horror comedy, even though it had some small issues.I will start by saying that Samara Weaving was incredibly good in the movie. She starts out being scared once she finds out what is going on, but soon gets the upper hand against the family which was what I wanted to see happen because I wanted her to survive the game. She does this all while wearing a wedding dress that gets ripped, dirty, and bloody throughout the movie as she hides or fights back.The family who are forced to play this game and hunt for Grace do an excellent job in the movie; they seem nice but eventually become insane and psychotic. They will seem too over the top with some performances, but they are funny mostly because of the dark and violent humor that is in this movie that can be shocking at times. Each character is weird in their own way in this movie.The look of the big house or mansion the family has does look cool, and big when the game begins with a lot of rooms, secret compartments, and dumbwaiters for hiding places. The cinematography is nice, and the look and feel of the place is eerie, especially because of the past of this house and family. The chase scenes or any action scene between the characters.There are some scenes that can be slow or not needed, but the movie is a fun horror comedy for most of the movie that has dark humor that works well with the horror scenarios. Ready or Not (2019) was a fun horror comedy that had effective scares and funny comedy, but surprising moments that I did not expect especially in the third act climax along with the movie being investing to watch wanting the main character to survive the game. If you like horror comedies or interesting premises like this, then you will like this movie.","

"gustheaffen","25 August 2019","People that say this is the worst horror movie ever clearly have not seen many horror movies. Well done, well cast and entertaining story even if some of it was somewhat predictable. Instead of just having the typical bash the rich they spun that to bash the rich but also all the greedy spouses that married into the family were forced to fight for their lives too. Just because they didn't get Hide & Seek when they had to play on their marriage night they were forced to play with the same consequence which was pretty ingenious and I thought the end was great. There were a lot of comical parts to the movie, many of the deaths were funny as was the YouTube video on how to us a weapon and it was also quite gory in parts. Overall I found it an entertaining 90 minutes and one of the better movies of this genre I've seen in years. I enjoyed it much more than Get Out and Halloween last year.
There could also probably be a sequel now that she is the survivor of the game.","

"Stovepipe99","21 August 2019","Is an 8/10 a little generous?Maybe.But I just got back from seeing this one in the theater and it was the perfect summer horror film: bloody and funny and just plain FUN.I really have very few criticisms about this film. Was it maybe a little predictable? I guess. But knowing where the story was going didn't stop me from enjoying the ride.Samara Weaving did a great job in the title role. Unlike a lot of films of this type, she doesn't just go from wilting violet to gun-toting war machine in the blink of an eye. Her character really goes through a complicated series of emotions and encounters, and the film wisely gives her strong scenes with the characters of her husband, her brother-in-law, and her mother-in-law. Even the more secondary characters are given distinct personalities and motivations, and so despite the sprawling cast I knew exactly who each character was and it added some impact to the violent scenes when they arrived.Adam Brody is really good as Daniel, the brother who reluctantly participates in his family's cruel traditions. I didn't even recognize Melanie Scrofano (I know her from Wynonna Earp) as the coked up sister-in-law, but she was hilarious.Without venturing into spoiler territory, I found the film to be violent and bloody, but not cruel or depressing. A lot of the violence was darkly funny, and the actors are generously doused with blood and gore. It has some broad themes about what people will do to become rich or to stay rich--a criticism of both rich people and the non-rich people who are willing to do horrible things to climb the ladder. But the film isn't overly concerned with delivering a message, so the broadness of its themes didn't bug me.Movies are always better on the big screen, but I would highly recommend this film as a rental--especially for a movie night with a group of friends.","

The film reminded me of Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"", because this film added psycho family, just like this one, and Ready or Not, is one of the worst deadliest game of Hide and Seek, that you never even heard, seen, or played before.

If it is any of them then it fails miserably.The movie was like fat guy stripping down naked and flashing his bum and waving his belly and expecting you not just to laugh but also like him but it just back fires.I've seen over 20 films in the IMDB bottom 100 and Ready or Not makes them look like masterpieces.Pure garbage which is why I walked out of the cinema after 20 minutes of torture.It's a really sad world we live in where a lot of really good scripts don't get made into movies and other projects get cancelled or gets into development hell but trash like these get made.","

A bit of gore for seasoning. It's a unique premise and overall disconcerting in the end. A shock horror flick for the Instagram generation.","

"lluewhyn","13 September 2019","While the concept of The Most Dangerous Game involving a woman against her in-laws is somewhat original, the execution of this film is bad.Problems:
1. This is probably the most undeveloped main character I have ever seen. You learn almost nothing about her history or desires, which makes it really hard to care about her more than the fact she's being chased by murderers. Most of the characterization and time is spent with the family members, who are the villains, and almost all of them are pathetic.2. The profanity in this film is over the top. The characters probably swear twice as much as a Tarantino film, and with a lot less creativity or impact. It would be funnier to hear the ""blue-blood"" family start swearing once things start getting so bad for them, but all of them are swearing left and right from the beginning of the film so there's no escalation that makes the profanity interesting.3. The film teases out a class struggle at the very beginning, with the protagonist concerned about marrying into this upper crust family, but along with the swearing from #2 these family members really don't act very high class at all, the main character Grace has a posh accent that doesn't make her come off as lower class, so this plot/theme goes nowhere at all.4. It looks like the filmmakers were trying to make this more realistic at times (but not consistently so), so the main protagonist has no special combat skills, ingenuity, or athletic ability. As a result, too many of her ""successes"" are pure luck or someone doing something stupid. As a result, this film pits the Unremarkable vs. the Unintelligent. This isn't that exciting.5. There are really very few interesting set pieces, probably due to lack of imagination or funds. The action appears in short, boring bursts, and there's no visual wow factor. You get the feeling they didn't have much in the way of stunt coordinators.6. A related problem is that you never get a good perspective of the mansion or grounds, and with characters wandering in and out of the plot at random, you never get a really good perspective of how difficult it would be to ""seek"" Grace. The film just meanders from room to room, and the tension of the hunt just dissipates as a result. I'm guessing they just didn't have the funds to acquire a good interior location for the set.","

"thekarmicnomad","20 December 2019","A woman who has just married into a rich, eccentric family discovers she has to play a game with the family on her wedding night.
No biggie.
Except as you have probably surmised from the movie poster it is not going to be a fun game.This has a lot of what you would expect: running around lofty corridors, sneaking through the spaces in the walls, hiding in kitchen cupboards and some gore that will make you wince.The film has a very witty dark humour running through it.
Inappropriate quips are made as the family members and servants are reduced to bloody pulp.What really makes this film is the lead character.
A very fine balance is maintained between her being a determined protagonist and a human being.
It is nice to see a lead character actually show a modicum of fear and distress when someone runs at them with an axe.
Samara Weaving has an awful lot piled on her shoulders and she carries it very well.
The rest of the family are also excellent and add comic relief and drama.Production and camera work is all top notch without being too extravagant.
This is not particularly scary but is quite a violent film in a slapstick kind of way.Great fun - don't take it too serious and you will have a ball.","

This is most highlighted part which brings your interest to watch further till end. A newly married bride faces dangerous riots from family of her husband. The family believes that if the new member is not killed in his / her first night at their home then all the members would get killed after dawn. After choosing hide and seek game bride finds horrible truth about family. Climax and end is interesting you will be little surprised about a twist at the end. As me it is enjoyable movie. Watchable at once. Leading female lady is perfect casting and did a good acting job.","

"RahulM007","16 November 2019","""Ready or Not"" is one of the best horror movies of 2019. It focuses on a bride whose welcomed in her husband's eccentric family. The movie is nor traditional or predictable. The twists and turns throughout the movie are all unexpected and shocking.The lead actress Samara Weaving who portrays Grace reminds me so much of Margot Robbie. The resemblance she has with her is uncanny. Grace had a quite open attitude to the family game/ritual, but that changed when she found out the true nature of it all.The levity in this movie was perfect and was not forced at all. It made some scenes more bearable to watch. I was at the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie and was not extremely fond of the gore and bloodiness depicted frequently in scenes. In hindsight, this movie is a horror movie and should feature these scenes.The twist at the end where Alex has a complete change in character and is on board with the whole family ritual was unexpected. I thought that Alex and Grace would escape together and never see the family again. In reality, Grace murdered Alex's mother and that drove Alex on a dark path and trying to fulfill the family ritual.The family failed to kill Grace by dawn, so they exploded. The house was haunted by the ghost of their grandfather. I thought that the family made all of this up. It was an interesting turn of events. It would have been quite anticlimactic if the whole family did not die.To conclude, ""Ready or Not"" is my favorite horror movie of 2019. It was a blast to watch this movie in the cinema. Strangely enough, the audience was not laughing at the scenes I found particularly funny. But everyone has different tastes.","

Also the combination of the comedy and horror were good, not in other movies that try combining those 2 genres and fail.I recomend watching it, i didnt have some expectations before watching it, but after watching it, the feeling i got, it was so unique and i am recomending it to all of my friends.

A bit more back story on even the bride would of helped,to care & hope of her survival.
Weather it was meant as a horror comedy or not,just parts didn't mix well.
I'm from an era of 80's campy movies,they can be silly & B-rated fun but it worked.
Have watched the actors in other movies,where they were great!
Unfortunately this movie,didn't keep my attention.

Acting was very well done by all cast members of the film.Only part i didn't get was the very ending when all family members randomly started blowing up I think it went a bit silly there but with the film been so entertaining all the way that weird twist is no big deal.Overall very entertaining movie I could watch this over and over without getting bored.","

"DarkVulcan29","22 August 2019","Think of a board game you get real into it, that is what Ready or Not kind of feels like. New Bride to be(Samara Weaving) feels like she does not fit in with the grooms rich family, on her wedding night is asked to play a game of hide and seek, what she believes is fun, turns into a night of getting out alive, when she realizes that the grooms family intends on hunting her down.This is not just a horror film, but very darkly humorous also. Samara Weaving(who is the niece of actor Hugo Weaving) really plays her part very well, you root for her all the way. All the characters are pretty good, you can see the actors all are having fun making this. But the other main stand out is Adam Brody, who plays the grooms brother, he plays his part with such conflict very well, you just really see it in his character. It feels like interesting story telling by Quentin Tarantino and M. Night Shyamalan, and an ending you'll talk about for a while.","

"JohnRayPeterson","8 December 2019","I'm not usually interested in the comedy horror thriller, but when I caught the ratings on another site and read some of the reviews here, I decided to give it a go. I was absolutely delighted. Best if I control myself and spare you any sort of spoiler; also best if you avoid them too, as your viewing experience will be that more rewarding.The concept was original and every element worked well, from a cast of characters who all have an important part to play to how well they played their part. The script I would tend to believe was an easy sell to the producers. Samara Weaving who plays the main character, Grace, doesn't steal the show, she is the show. You will have your pick of delicious characters to root for, oh yes you will; and by 'root for' I mean wish you could beat the living daylight out of, but always in a fun way.The production and direction appear not to have missed any detail, important or small, which is why the story flows well. As for the visual, again, very pleasant and most importantly, effective. Lastly but not to be denied, the soundtrack and tune selection was right on the money; it enhanced it all superbly. If you understand what contrast in art, all forms of it, is about and how it works, then you'll get that the contrast the soundtrack delivered is what brings you to smile all along and without missing a beat to the very end.If this review didn't provide any clue of what the movie is about, except for the genre, but left you with a feeling that it is one you would want to see, then you can thank me later, after you've watched it.","

They underestimated her ability to escape their murderous intent.","

"matthewssilverhammer","30 August 2019","Not since 2011's Cabin in the Woods has a horror comedy been this uniquely fun, cleverly written, and perfectly demented. And like Cabin..., it's not flawless; the direction certainly could use a defter touch, especially in the cinematography and scare controls (oddly, Wes Anderson came to mind as an interesting replacement). However, if the flaws are part of the package, a package that includes a wonderfully original script and pitch perfect performances, then like a good marriage, I'll take the better and the worse.
Like Get Out, it's a horror satire that presents one of our biggest fears: a worst-case-scenario for meeting the in-laws. On her wedding night, Grace (Weaving) is forced into a deadly game of hide-and-seek with her husband's family. The balance of tones and genres here is vital and difficult, but they hit the target at each turn, giving us a wonderfully absurd 70's grindhouse / Roger Corman picture for the modern day. Weaving is sensational and hilarious as the baddest bride since Uma Thurman hunted down Bill, and the cast of characters hunting her down are varied and often side-splittingly funny.
Underneath the entertainment heights, there is plenty of sharp satire bubbling up. The rich preying on the poor. Selling our souls for the almighty dollar. The trappings of our upbringing. The motivating power of all kinds of fear. The absurdity of religious certainty. Each of these elements packs a punch, but none of it would hit as hard if the movie weren't also an absolute blast. Ready or Not is easily one of my favorite films of the year, and I can't wait to watch it again and again.","

"EdwardtheBlackPrince","29 May 2021","For Grace it is the happiest day of her life she is about to be married to the man she loves and be welcome into his rich family however the special day ceases to be midnight comes and decide to play a game. The game however hide and seek and when they find her she'll be sacrificed. This movie takes the cat and mouse aspect of your next and mixes it with the comedic charm of knives out. It's a fun over the top film. You can tell all these actors are having a good time and enjoying themselves, while giving memorable performances. The settings are very well this whole manor is just right for various situations that happen. It doesn't really beat around the bush the opening it gets to the game rather quick. The costume designs are nice. Grace is awesome she's very believable she doesn't come off as Op, which where she's just one shot it everyone and giving them the roundabout. She does get injured and she does good get bloodied and bruised ,but you really don't know anything about her the focus is primarily kept on the family. The duality between the two brothers Alex and Daniel you really get a general feel that Alex really does care for Grace and wants to see you're safe , where's Daniel you don't really know what to make of him he's more neutral and he honestly does not even care about this whole ordeal. You're left wondering what the outcome out it's going to be, this whole event that may happen with the whole family will die if Grace doesn't die before dawn. The thing is the family doesn't actually know what will happen so it does make you wonder is there actually something going on here are they just a bunch of psychotic rich people?","

It does not rely on jump scare scenes, which is a big plus, and there is a lot of dark humor, which is why the film can find its audience. The atmosphere, setting and visuals are excellent. However, the script is very bad, the plot of the film is minimal, and the characters seem to not exist, which ultimately bothered me. In the end we have a horror movie that entertained me and that doesn't rely on a formula like the vast majority of (bad) horror movies and that's why the movie gets a thumbs up from me.","

"Benslie","23 August 2019","First of all, I wish this film was a bit longer. The film is one hour and thirty-five minutes, with credits, and I feel like if it was longer it would have helped it out a bit more. This is a slight spoiler but it's the opening scene so either skip over this or read it but the film just jumps straight into the film. There is no lead up into it, it just jumps right in so not till later in the film do we learn why they are doing this. So, I feel like a couple of extra minutes in this film could have helped it out. The acting starts out cheesy and kind of annoying but as the film goes on and the stakes get higher it takes a sharp turn and becomes pretty good. As the movie progresses you get to see which family members are fully invested into this and which ones would rather not do it. I will say that Grace is one of the most badass characters in horror and I was always cheering her on. I will say the editing in the film is kind of award at times and makes no sense. I say sometimes because most of the time it's edited just fine but in a couple of scenes it just jumps to a scene that isn't connected and almost feels like the directors were like, ""Shoot we forgot that one scene well let's just throw it in between these two scenes even though it doesn't make any sense to."" This film is a horror-comedy and I will say they balance the two well and a couple of scenes had me chuckling. The last thing I want to mention is the score by Brian Tyler is great. In the end, I highly recommend checking out this film at least once because it's a unique and original story and we don't have a lot of that now a day.","

Fully delivered, and was clever, fun, and as stylish as trailer promised. Had a plot, an actual story, which is rare for a horror film, and good writing, acting, production value. I was into it from beginning to end. Kept good pacing, was not too long or too short, and everything was clear and well explained without overdoing it and feeding everything to the audience.Best horror film since Cabin in the Woods. Happy Death Day had a similar fun, but a bit more b-movie than this. A warm welcome since most horror films over the past 20 years have really sucked. They've been either the gore porn garbage of the 2000s, or found-footage with terrible quality and zero story, or shock-value indie directors with lack of actual substance, so, this was refreshing.It's made much more than it's budget, but I'm guessing it hasn't done better because there wasn't that much advertising for it, and given the news today, people are a bit turned off by the subject matter. It wasn't gratuitous, and relied much more on the story, which had a point and was not just random violence.Well worth it to see in the theatre, but renting it at home will probably be nearly as enjoyable.","

I liked Andie MacDowell in here but she does do the same fake southern accent in every role she takes, no idea why? Anyway, our heroine is quite likable. The rest of the family is convinced if they do not follow the game's rules they will end up with an unfavorable fate. Now this whole allegory wraps up nicely in the end.

I have to say that it is due to main girl in the film - she was just perfect, but 2 brothers too and all others.Really utterly entertaining! I recommend to all. Not sure if this is bloody comedy or comedic horror. Anyway, I am sure everyone can enjoy it.10 from me","

"writers_reign","30 September 2019","I've just read approximately a dozen negative reviews right here on imdb and I'm guessing that these were penned by the Nightmare On Elm St/Halloween set i.e. the kind of moviegoer who takes gore seriously and thus feels let down by this tongue-in-cheek entry. I, on the other hand, have yet to see a Saw (sorry about that, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or indeed anything remorely resembling 'horror' so I was happy to go along with this black comedy and bask in the laugh out loud moments that punctuated it. I doubt if it would claim to be another Some Like It Hot, or even Young Frankenstein but it's harmless and reasonably entertaining.","

"asinyne","5 September 2019","This movie is a wild ride. I picked it because all the others had already started. I was the only one in there. It was probably the most fun Ive had while going to a movie along since the original Road Warrior. It was tongue in cheek funny at times with a hilarious closing line. There is plenty of anxious moments for you to endure. I really enjoyed it. The cast was very good and kind of eccentric. The blood letting may have set some kind of a record. Not for the squeamish. But its all in fun and the sets are very creepy and cool. I recommend this very much for horror fans. The cast played it very straight...mostly....ha.","

"joseph-brak","9 October 2020","Ready or Not pits a newly wed bride against the wealthy - and homicidal - in-laws on her wedding night. Samara Weaving does a great job at playing the victim while also remaining resilient, and brings a sense of sassy style to the character, aided by her cool and clever costume design (great cosplay potential!). The setting of an extravagant and slightly ominous mansion really adds to the flavour of the film as well. The subtle mystery element to the plot is also concluded with a near perfect ending, which matches the slightly bizarre nature of the film and leaves the film finishing on a high note.","

"joshbarton15","29 September 2019","Marital bliss, achieved through the matrimony of two people very much in love and willing to spend the rest of their lives together in sickness and in health, until ""death do us part"". In the hands of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, that death may come sooner than you'd expect into the marriage with Ready or Not, a thunderously entertaining black comedy horror.When Grace (Samara Weaving) and Alex (Mark O'Brien) become newlyweds, Grace doesn't get the wedding night she'd expect when Alex's family force her to take part in a murderous game of hide and seek in which she must survive the night to be officially welcomed to the family.If done right, films like Ready or Not can be absolute crowd-pleasers, as long as you go along with the lunacy served up by the filmmakers. Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy have conjured up a devilishly funny screenplay, full of put-downs as sharp as knives and plenty of gleeful violence. It's a film that wears its 18 certificate like a badge of honour, decorating the hallways with blood as the game of hide and seek ramps up in intensity, and it's really great to see a film not hold back in this sense.Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett do a slick job of directing the chaos, Brett Jutkiewicz's cinematography opening up hiding spaces amidst the glorious country house setting for the film while Brian Tyler's score possesses an energy that accompanies Grace's fight for survival so fittingly.Samara Weaving may well look like Margot Robbie however, she's well on her way to attaining star status on her own merits thanks to a fantastic lead performance in Ready or Not, the combination of sheer terror and comedy she brings to the film no doubt making her a future icon of the genre. The supporting cast really do make this such a treat as well, Henry Czerny and Nicky Guadagni in particular going all out in the insanity department for our entertainment.I had an absolute blast watching Ready or Not, a film that will most likely be experienced best with the biggest audience possible. Both my future wife and I came out thoroughly entertained however, if any of her family suggest playing hide and seek on our wedding day, I'm running for the hills.","

"timothyhilditch","26 January 2022","A women gets married into a wealthy family and has to play a game with them on her wedding night. A slasher gimmick movie. The game starts off serious with everyone trying to win, but once everyone understands the rules it turns into a lot of fun.Didn't give me lots of laughs just a fun watch, with an interesting gimmick.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","29 September 2019","For me, the comedy in 'Ready Or Not (2019)' isn't all that successful. It's never particularly funny and its attempts at humour sometimes, but only sometimes, reduce immersion. Usually, however, this isn't an issue. The tone is pretty much spot-on for the knowingly absurd narrative, turning what could've been a self-serious and, therefore, seriously silly affair into a near inside joke with its tongue planted firmly in its cheek. The beauty of it all is that there's never an attempt to undercut the weight of the situation. It's a fight for survival, on both sides, and it's as messy as you'd expect. In fact, the comedic beats often serve more as character insights than anything else, allowing the piece to build an interesting and relatively realistic set of core players. Most characters react as you'd expect them to, which is rarer than you'd think. Also, the villainous family are given much more time and nuance than the trailers seemed to indicate. Everyone has an understandable mindset, even if it's violent and deranged, and a few key folk undergo some serious character arcs that are expertly established and surprisingly executed. Generally, the flick follows a predictable formula but it has more than enough charm to account for this. It becomes somewhat repetitive as it goes on but it's always compelling and its finale is subversively satisfying. There's not as much focus on 'fight-back revenge' as I anticipated, which actually makes for a more intriguing time. Where everything ends up is a shock, but it's built to so naturally that it feels inevitable. The whole thing is just so grounded, probably the most relatable version possible. It's entertaining throughout and it's always smiling alongside you. That doesn't mean that it misses out on the pain such a piece requires. There are several moments that should make you wince and the protagonist is certainly put through the wringer, both inside and out. The overall message is slightly muddled - though, to say why would be a spoiler - and the ending may just have been better if it went in another, hinted-at direction (mainly when it comes to clarifying what seems to be the movie's initial intent). Still, there are underlying themes which are interesting to explore retrospectively and the consistent focus on character is commendable. The experience, as it is, is both enjoyable and believable. Its story is purposefully silly, wonderfully so, and it's handled with a fantastic balance of humour and gravitas. I actually buy everything the affair is selling. I think I like it more now than I did just after the credits had rolled. There's never a dull moment, really. It's remarkably consistent entertainment. 7/10","

"cherold","12 January 2020","After watching the first tedious half hour of Ready or Not I began to wonder if it was really the kick-ass comedy-horror movie of the trailer, so I took a look at the IMDB reviews. And I discovered, much to my confusion, that no one seemed to agree on whether the movie was a comedy or a horror movie. Some felt it was comedy-horror, but others felt it was a horror movie with a few comedy bits (that some liked and some didn't).Having watched the movie I now understand. The movie has scenes that are definitely comedic involving the ridiculous characters and some startling moments of comedic violence. And the movie has scenes of grim struggle and peril. But these scenes don't particularly feel like they're part of the same movie, and there's no integration of the two elements; no moments that are scary but funny or funny but scary.For me, the funny parts are quite good. But I found the horror elements intrusive in the way some reviewers here found the comedy elements intrusive. Which parts you find bothersome will be a matter, perhaps, or your expectations.By the halfway point I started fast forwarding through the horror bits just to see how it all turned out.There is a good comedy-horror movie trapped inside Ready or Not. There's also a decent B horror movie trapped in there. The two movies don't get along.The cast is quite good, particularly protagonist Samara Weaving, who has an intensity that makes her interesting even before things get crazy.To summarize: Boring first half hour, some really good comedy horror, some non-comedy horror that I guess is okay for that sort of thing, pretty good ending.Not recommended.","

"CinemaClown","20 September 2019","Refreshingly original, riotously fun & ridiculously entertaining, Ready or Not is a slick, sly & subversive delight that packs a ridiculous premise yet implements it with such flair & finesse that it is one of the best surprises to surface in cinemas this year. Wild & wicked from start to finish, it is all the more bolstered by a star-making turn from Samara Weaving.Directed by a collective trio of filmmakers known as Radio Silence, the set-up is quick, the fundamentals are illustrated with clarity, and once the main plot kicks in, the directors steadily up the ante and cleverly balance the extreme with the grounded to make sure that the cinematic ride isn't just tense & thrilling but also fun & amusing throughout its runtime.Apart from the intelligently written script, this gnarly survival horror also benefits from its aptly processed colour grading, dark & delirious ambience, sumptuous set pieces, sharp editing, brisk pace, pulsating score, costume design and clever mix of dark humour & thrills. Coming to performances, Samara Weaving is a revelation in her role, and renders her character's overwhelming feelings with both authenticity & precision.On an overall scale, Ready or Not deftly merges horror, humour & cultural critique into one sharp, stylish & scintillating horror-comedy that scores high on all fronts. A vicious, vivid & vigorous blend of You're Next & Get Out that makes the most of available resources to deliver a cinematic experience that's an absolute blast from the first frame to the last, this indie horror-comedy is one of the most enjoyable & entertaining examples of its genre(s).","

Besides the silly plot gimmicks here and there, the narrative flows smoothly and the main premisse of the plot is innovative enough to get you intrigued and to keep the whole thing going.

"quaseprovisorio","1 April 2020","This movie is not very different from some leisure activities of french or the portuguese royalty. They would release a pig in the woods, or another animal to eat and the first person getting it or killing it would be the winner. With another context this isn't very different: a bunch of powerful peope against someone from a foster family. The Man vs you.It is put in a very simple way yes - but the truth is: if this wasn't the main theme of the film, the killing order would be very different. Notice how the first ones to die are the maids and the driver? They are the weaker ones. The powerful die at the end. I would love to see the theme getting more developed, because it would be funnier to see the bride killing them, but they are humans too and the movie expresses that well.Besides that, the film has funny moments and some gory moments too, that are an appeal to the audience. But what makes this movie having dark humor is how unworried about the life of the ""peasants"" the rich family is. It's their indifference that makes the funny part of this movie, how normal they treat their employees getting killed. It's like they don't even realize they are human beings like them. Maybe they don't give them the same value they attribute to themselves.That's why this movie is a seven for me and not a six or even a five. Without the social commentary is not as good as other scary movies. But because that layer is important here, i think it elevates to most of scary movies out there.","

"rlaine","3 June 2020","Horror comedy is not an easy genre and I can't really think of many that are actually good, although I'm not a die hard fan of the genre either. Ready or Not succeeds quite well tho, I was entertained. It's not that much of a horror, as it's not really scary, but rather depends on the gore. I bet real gore hounds would've liked even more, but a few scenes were a bit too much for me, not a huge gore fan here.My kind of ""horror"" comedy is the lighter kind, Joe Dante etc, not necessarily the Evil Dead etc kind that are more hard core.What I liked was the somewhat cliched crazy family mansion, candles, thunder, secret passages kind of old school ""gothic"" atmosphere, it made a lot for me. Acting was pretty good (although too much flat out screaming for me), the comedy was quite nicely timed and the characters were nicely balancing between crazy and goofy.Well made movie not to be taken too seriously!","

Especially when you are in a initiation to be part of the family. Ready or not is a Hide and Seek horror film. Where your life is on the line. Ultimately what's disturbing is the maids and butler who do the work in a rich family house, gets killed by a dumbass who can't do anything right.The bride gets picked as she hides and defends herself from a devil worshipping family. Has lots of cuss words, dark humor, and some disturbing images. If you enjoy it then you will probably love this movie. If you don't like what I said then skip it.","

"Jackblyth8","27 December 2021","A film of extreme consequence, with a thrilling, fast pace allowing the vehicle that is a seemingly innocent game turn into a breathless horror of fatality.After the wedding ceremony of a young woman, her new in-laws force her to participate in a seemingly innocent game. Things soon turn bloody and sinister, revealing the sick rituals of the family.Star of Sex, Lies and Videotapes Andie MacDowell is the single 'big' name of the production, which is naturally an off-putting feature when deciding what to watch. Ready or Not is a title of ambiguity for the film presented, rather than the game, this idea of hiding in an attempt to not be found, or running away from the past, or maybe questioning the bride's ability to meet the standards of the family she is marrying into - Tyler Gillet and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin are the architects behind the horror which sets heads spinning from its violent uses of brutality, one could argue one too many shots fired and knives stabbing.The setting takes place in the radius of a gated area (albeit large), the historical mansion proving token to the film's background as well as the vast garden adding irony to the picture's core, despite playing Hide and Seek there is but limited room to hide and in-turn limited room to seek. Claustrophobia is a theme which drives the motives of the 95 minute watch, an elaborate, primitive concept well concealed in a sublimely finished script.Gaining a respectable 6.9/10 on IMDB along with an impressive 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, the film that amassed over $57 million in its Box Office proved a dark horse in the film game, and rightly so, with a narrow budget of $6 million, Ready or Not is a different kind of mystical, and most certainly worth a watch.","

"mixymaxy","17 December 2020","I'm a big horror fan and my preferences are a little different from others. I like movies with sick and sinister games, movies with a variety of characters to choose from, movies that dont lose 'horror' while adding 'comedy', movies with a cheerworthy protagonist, or movies that are good till the end. Any of these traits make me like a movie. Thats the reason I hate movies like Hereditary.
Ready or Not, however, was an unexpected bomblast. At the time of its release, I felt like its a boring old fashioned horror (I'm a modern horror fan), so I didn't even research about it. An year later, when I was in quarantine, I found Ready or Not's sypnosis quite attracting. Finally, I decided to watch it and it is my favourite movie now. I would give it infinity stars if possible.
Ready or Not offers a range of characters from the funny, dumb Emilie to the Caring yet deadly Becky. Needless to say, Samara Weaving stole the show by a far margin. Her performance was uncomparable. Probably one of the best movie performances ever. After that, the rest of the crew was no less either. The problem I get with most movies that offer a varying personalities is that as characters die, the movie gets boring. But Ready or Not gives us a roller coaster ride with a satisfying ending, which makes me smile everytime I watch it.
The Hide and Seek Song is a very effective song as well.
Moreover, Ready or Not has a perfect dose of comedy and its protagonist is not stupid. Samara Weaving has always killed the roles she played no matter if it was The Babysitter's Bee or Bill or Ted Face the Music's Theodora.
The movie is worthy of a watch.
I recommend it 100%. I hope we get a sequel.","

The problem is that even with a very nice cast the movie jerks between the two themes never really transitioning smoothly. At times it feels like the direction was ""okay this time we are going to kill someone for laughs"" or ""in this one the murder is serious"". It's one of those movies that you find that you never heard of and after watching it you understand why. Not the worst thing available but in six months I doubt I remember anything about it other than Samara Weaving was in it. Knives Out works much better if you want to watch a messed up rich family murder movie, though not nearly as bloody.","

"TwistedContent","25 November 2019","Took a long time for me to get my hands on ""Ready or Not"" & a horror (comedy) that manages to stay above 7.0 on IMDb 20 thousand votes in is expected to be pretty good in my book. Well, it really was quite an enjoyable romp, but I beg to differ and oppose to those who praise ""Ready or Not"" for originality and are calling it refreshing or unique.""Ready or Not"" is without a doubt a solid one to add to the not-so-many great horror comedies of this century, but it's also far from flawless. An unsuspecting woman is getting married at her new husbands massively rich familys house, a bunch of dysfunctional and secretive family members get introduced, a silly and mysterious tradition turns into a violent, devious and satanic rollercoaster. The pacing's even, we get carried on smoothly by solid acting, quality cinematography, gruesome kills, dry humour and somewhat familiar characters. Personally, it was the violence, action, the overall aesthetic and some of the performances that did it for me. I laughed maybe once, the jokes are pretty dry and mostly far from original, but I do not think of it as much of a fault here. The twist/s (if you can call them that) are predictable, in fact, the whole movie is quite easy to predict. Most of the themes presented have been seen before, recent indies like ""Satanic Panic"" and ""Monster Party"" come to mind, of course, these specific ones are a lot cheaper and also worse examples of the same themes. The dysfunctional family farce and all the shticks that come with it have been enjoyed tens of times before, sadly, ""Ready or Not"" doesn't reinvent the ways of that.Don't get me wrong, it's a highly entertaining and satisfying romp of graphic horror, okay comedy and high budget sound & looks, it's just that it's not much of a memorable movie, and I couldn't call it unique under any duress. My rating: 7/10.","

"Jared_Andrews","25 August 2020","What a fun movie this is. For a joyous hour and a half, you can step into a simpler world. There's a likable hero (Samara Weaving) facing off against an unlikable villain family of psychotic satanic kooks.Psychotic satanic kooks, you say? Right, so what happens is the hero marries into a rich family who has amassed its fortune in games (think Parker Brothers or Milton Bradley). When the family insists that the wedding night end with a game, the hero views it as a quirky but harmless escapade. Oh, how wrong she is. Because of her misfortune of randomly drawing the card to play Hide and Seek, the entire family now believes they must kill her before dawn or suffer the wrath of a gamesman spirit that is responsible for their family fortune, or something like that. The details of the plotdon't matter a great deal other than to understand that the family is trying to kill her, so she runs around in a wedding dress trying to survive.Tonally, the movie is much more funny and exciting than it is scary. Even if you frighten easily, you should be able to tolerate this one. Though, a fair warning is needed about the violence. There's a lot of that. Much of it is comic violence, but a queasy stomach might act up anyway. Again, I'm just giving a fair warning.In a world where everything is politicized, you might have seen some people doing so with this movie. To me, that's a bit of a reach. At most, I would admit there is some fairly obvious social commentary, as the rich family members ridicule and look down their noses at this woman who isn't wealthy and is marrying into their world. The groom's aunt takes particularly aim at the bride, attacking her with her eyes and then later on literally attacking her with an axe.The message is clear, but I didn't bother exploring it too deeply because the movie doesn't appear to be asking for that from viewers. What I would encourage viewers to do instead is to enjoy the marvelous work of Weaving as she fights for her life in the most charming way possible. She's an absolute star, and the movie does not succeed if she is not able to balance being equal parts tough, cunning, and amused by the absurdity of her situation.","

The violence and gore was well used and not really over the top till the end but used for some good humor. Little dissapointed the writers didn't go for a different ending for some characters but talking with my dad he dissagrees and felt the it was great and I can see his point of view.

"gortx","7 September 2019","This would be cheeky satire using a game of deadly Hide and Seek as a metaphor for the vanity of the upper class isn't as clever as it thinks it is, although it does have it's moments. Samara Weaving is Grace, who marries into the rich eccentric family of Alex (Mark O'Brian). Alex doesn't prepare his bride for her wedding night - a game of chance that must be played in order to keep the family tradition alive (conveniently, Grace doesn't bring along any family or friends of her own).
Turns out, this wedding's game mixes Hide & Seek with The Most Dangerous Game -- Grace isn't just to be 'found' but hunted down like prey (Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None is also name-checked). Alex's family are a ghoulish lot with Andie MacDowell and Henry Czerny as his parents, Nicky Guadagni as a nasty aunt along with others including new sister in laws played by Elyse Levesque and Melanie Scrofano. Adam Brody is Alex' close brother Daniel.
The plot doesn't get much more complicated than the set-up, but those with a sick sense of humor (guilty), will find some devilish delights in the gruesome goings on. Writers Gary Busick and Ryan Murphy (no, not THAT one) along with co-Directors Matt Bettini-Olpin and Tyler Gillett try to add a layer of social commentary about the rich and their lack of empathy, but, it's extremely weak tea. Any real bite is severely undermined by resorting to various versions of F-Bombs. Deep.
Weaving makes for a plucky heroine. The actors are game, and the Production Design (Andrew Stearn) is suitably creepy and garish. There are some genuine laughs and some scattered suspense, it's just unfortunate that more care wasn't give to creating a more cohesive tone and, most certainly, another polish of the screenplay. Ready or Not? Mainly: ""or"".","

"redroominparis","16 June 2020","Very poorly written, loaded with bad talent. I'm shocked Andie McDowell agreed to this. Adam Brody is ok, because he's doing the Adam Brody thing he does. The main character, Samara, spends way too much time growling and screaming in such a way that made pause it to watch you tube videos. It also seemed like the directors recycled scenes. I think they were going for shock value? I'm not sure. I guess the strengths could be set design, tough lighting job but pulled it off nicely. Worst, absolute worst performance by far was the Grandmother. You could tell the actor was extremely uncomfortable with the garbage script, cliche lines. She probably is classically trained and needed the paycheck. It was probably fun to shoot though.","

"Indyrod","5 April 2020","Last night I had the pleasure of watching one of the best horror comedies I have ever seen. I'm not all that much of a fan of most horror comedy movies, but ""Ready or Not"" completely knocked me out. Not only is it loaded with blood and gore in abundance, but the story or script is very very good, as is the acting. The movie is about a couple getting married, the male being from a very rich family and the couple is going to the family's estate to meet his family for a celebration. At midnight the bride has to participate in a game, depending on a card the bride picks that signifies what game it will be. this is a ritual the family does anytime a new member is introduced to the family. The only problem, a very big problem, is the card the bride draws is the worst one possible. The bride thinks it is just a hide and seek game, but it turns out, the family now has to kill her before the Sunrise. Then the fun starts, and so do the laughs. I just loved this movie, not only is it fun to watch this bumbling family trying to find and kill her, the blood and gore effects are top notch. If you haven't seen this jewel, I strongly suggest you do, I can almost guarantee you'll be totally entertained, unless the blood and gore is too much for you.","

"richardwworkman","26 March 2021","At first glance this is an entertaining shoot 'em up, pursuit horror but the weird family incorporating an innocent to suit some dastardly plan echos Get Out.It's no surprise that the family in question are rich through inheritance, bloated with a sense of superiority and misguided exceptionalism. Remind you of any other powerful American family?The Trumpian sense of uselessness among the trappings of weirdly Edwardian opulence gave this film a brilliant comic edge. Each attempt to fulfil a bizarre prophecy is thwarted by slapstick levels of incompetence.The final girl inevitably comes good although, quite rightly given the plot of the film, this is more by accident than design.If you don't fancy the political commentary undertone to this it's easy enough to switch off and just enjoy the glorious bloody mess. There's some very realistic injury detail and gore for the horror aficionados.","

I also loved the cinematography, the character development, the acting, and the scenarios, the technical aspects are almost Oscar worthy.The weakest thing in my opinion was the rushed ending, I would give more 10 minutes instead to finish the movie in a bloody and fast way.Avoid the trailer (or try to forget it) because it shows a lot of important scenes and some funny jokes. Because Ready or Not is surely one of the most thrilling experiences of this year.","

"bastos","16 March 2021","As an avid horror fest goer I usually like these gory, fun, gimmicky kind of movies, but here, some inconsistencies make it just a near hit for me. The main problem, in my opinion, is the main character, as she has an alarming lack of development in the script department and she's neither cool nor badass enough for the underdevelopment not to be an issue. She's just there, annoying and oblivious to almost everything, playing this game and you're supposed to root for her. The family is a bit better treated by the screenplay, as most of them are well established if a bit cliched, and you can understand more or less their motivations while being actually funny. Another minor thing I didn't like was the inconsistency of the game, as at first it was just a normal hide and seek game but later on there is this ritual you're supposed to do, which makes absolutely no sense at all, I really hated that. Other than that it is fun and entertaining with a very memorable ending that redeems most of the faults throughout.","

"mgwmusic","30 January 2020","Fun movie (certainly not a waste of time), but it could have been way better. Dialogue sucked. Too much overuse of profanity to try and sound modern/hip/cool. How about actually writing with some intelligence and vocabulary (I know, I know, it's really hard to look up words in an online thesaurus).This movie had a great mood/feeling throughout, but it lacked in some areas that would really make it better:1. The whole, everybody gets CGI zapped at the end was entirely too convenient (and not scary by the way - how about some disturbing practical effects? Which 99% of modern horror lacks - which is why they suck by the way).2. It would have been much more fun if the bride went on a vengeance rampage (à la You're Next). Instead, she basically, avoided everybody until dawn - meh.3. Also, the lore was a very interesting start, but they didn't dive in nearly enough, and it could have been so much cooler had they gone into the history & ""why"" of it more. Again the ending was too convenient and ""wrap-up for time's sake."" It would have been much better if they actually had the spirit show up (i.e. more than a stupid shadow in a chair) and actually wreak some havoc.4. I get that a lot of the movie was meant to be funny (and it honestly was in some parts), but unfortunately, it would have been better to just use it as comic relief, rather than stretching too thin on both parts (i.e. horror and comedy) and creating a basically watered down horror movie with no real tension.","

"hamanoooo23","28 August 2019","Not gonna lie, the concept seemed interesting and original with potential. However, execution was terrible. It starts off well with proper horror vibes that kept me on the edge of my seat right until the first 'accidental' death of one of the maids. It was at this point that I knew it was going downhill. By the time they got to the third maid's death, I was ready to leave.The excessive comic relief scenes were completely unnecessary and made me cringe. I still don't get how/why movies try to incorporate comedy in horror films because they're two conflicting genres that defeat each other's purpose. What's worse is that the characters were extremely unfunny and the deaths were ridiculous, therefore taking away the fright factor (if it existed).But the worst part has got to be the ending. So they were right all along and as a result, they all died in a comical way? Ha ha? We barely got to see any kills in the movie. Why kill all these characters in one stupid scene instead of using them to make a good horror film with several separate deaths.Overall, the movie was absolute garbage. Seemed like a mix of Get Out and the Cabin in the Woods but A LOT worse. All the high ratings are probably from teenagers or people with low IQs that find comedic horror films 'entertaining'.","

Second, there is not an original story here, is quite boring. Same story in a house told a hundred times in a hundred different ways.
Third, the script is a joke. Weird decisions from the characters and stupid deaths.
Lastly, the ending is quite original, but the execution is pretty bad. No tension or something similiar. Predictable. So, overall just an OK movie.","

The plot is fantastic and original and the cast did a superb job portraying a twisted family. The main actress did also a great job, her stress and shock seemed so authentic. Only reason why I'm not giving this a 9/10 is because some of the plot twists didn't make sense to me. The characters wad sudden ""change-of-hearts"" which were illogical in my opinion. But other wise this is a solid horror-comedy with fun gore and great comedic moments. You have to watch this!","

"paul-allaer","8 September 2019","""Ready Or Not"" (2019 release; 95 min.) brings the story of Grace and the Le Domas family. As the movie opens, we see two young boys running around in a large mansion, only to see a guy get shot by bow and arrow. Is it real? or just play? We then go to ""30 Years Later"", and we get to know Grace, who is rehearsing her wedding vows. She is set to marry Alex Le Domas, on of the boys we saw in the opening scene. After the wedding ceremony, Alex informs Grace that according to family tradition, they will play a game starting at midnight. By luck of the draw, Grace gets ""Hide and Seek""... At this point we are 10 min, into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by up-and-coming Matt Betinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, who previously brought us ""Devil's Due"". Here they bring what turns out to be a traditional ""horror"" movie, albeit with a slightly black comedy twist. From the get-go it all appears so straight-forward, and hence I expected a major plot twist or some other significant departure from this tried-and-true genre. Alas, it didn't happen and hence I felt a bit let down: was this supposed to be scary? or funny? Bottom line is that it is neither. The movie benefits significantly from Australian actress Samara Weaving's breakout role as Grace. Surely we have not seen the last of her. Check out Andie McDowell (in the role of Alex's mother), who remains as lovely as ever. But other than that, this movie just felt average to me: not really bad, but nowhere near as good as, say, the similarly themed ""Get Out"".""Ready Or Not"" was released wide a few weeks ago, and now in its third weekend, I finally went to see it here in Cincinnati. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was not attended well (6 people in total). This movie has been getting great reviews (it's currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), and I must admit that I am a bit dumbfounded by that as for me there really was nothing special about this movie. But if you like horror-with-comedy films, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on COD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","

"wlee08","15 September 2019","As crazy as they come. Not sure why I liked this so much - maybe the color, the music (classical), the thrill of the chase, the folkloric story rooted in the classic short (and black and white feature) ""The Most Dangerous Game"".
This is The Most Dangerous Game if Tarantino got his hands on it. So in some ways the initial develpment is a bit predictable, and not always fully credible, but those would be the only weaknesses. You'll have a good laugh if you're into black humor. You'll have a jump or two from the edge of the seat. Bends a few genres in a similar way to movies like Cabin in the Woods, Get Out, or maybe even Mother!, but is probably a bit funnier than all of those","

"DaegT","28 December 2019","I came to a big big question after watching about half of the movie: ""Is it a point-n-shoot game or is it Ritual?"" You caught her n u could readily kill her right there. And that should be the end of the story. But then u brought her back for a time-consuming ritual? Hell yeah then u gave her plenty of time n chances to change her fate. I really can't come to a clue.But other than this big plot hole, I quite enjoy the dark comedy and the thriller atmosphere of the whole movie. It won't make my heart beats faster, and it won't stun my brain for even once, but I love the dark, strange and survival horror in a combination.I would recommend it if you have free Friday night for it.","

"jboothmillard","6 October 2019","I saw the trailer at least four times before the film's release, it looked like a good concept for a scary movie, and I'm glad it received positive reviews, including from Mark Kermode, so I was really looking forward to it. Basically, the wealthy Le Domas family hosts a generations-long tradition of playing a game at midnight on the wedding night with each new addition to the family. In a flashback many years ago, young Alex Le Domas (Chase Churchill) and his brother Daniel (Etienne Kellici) witness the killing of a man named Charles (Andrew Anthony), who has just married their aunt Helene (Elana Dunkelman). Thirty years later, Grace (Samara Weaving, Hugo's niece) is the newest addition to the Le Domas family, having married Alex (Mark O'Brien), who has been estranged from the family for years. Alex is hesitant to be back at the family estate, but Grace reassures him and is eager to become part of his family. Following the wedding ceremony, Grace is informed of the family initiation custom and meets with the rest of the in-laws. Participating in the tradition with the happy couple are Alex's alcoholic brother Daniel (Adam Brody), father Tony (Henry Czerny), mother Becky (Andie MacDowell), Daniel's snobbish wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), Alex's drug-addicted sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano), Emilie's whiny husband Fitch Bradley (Kristian Bruun), and Tony's older sister, the sombre Helene (Nicky Guadagni). Tony is told that she must draw a card from a mysterious wooden box and play whatever game is written on the card with the family and become a member of the ""dominion"". Tony tells the story of his great-grandfather Victor Le Domas, who made a deal with a man named Mr. Le Bail, who helped to create the Le Domas fortune if the family established the tradition. Grace draws from the box a card that reads ""Hide and Seek."" Grace believes the game is harmless, she will be hiding while the other family members seek. While she leaves to hide in the estate, the Le Domas family, excluding Alex, arm themselves with antique weapons to hunt her down. Alex manages to find Grace before his family, they witness Emilie accidentally kill a maid, shooting her in the head with a shotgun. Alex didn't tell Grace about the Le Domas tradition, believing says the odds of Hide and Seek being chosen being unlikely, it is the only game that would prompt the family to try to kill Grace. The Le Domas family believes that if they fail to kill Grace before dawn, they will all die as part of the deal with Mr. Le Bail (whose name is an anagram of Belial, an alias for Satan), decades earlier. Grace is shocked and angry with Alex at not telling her about the ritual, but he feared she would leave him. Against his family's wishes, Alex promises Grace he will help her escape, he heads to the house's security room and tells Grace to go to the kitchen. While looking for the exit, Grace encounters a second maid, she accidentally activates the mechanical dumbwaiter elevator and kills the maid. Daniel, who is also against the family tradition, finds Grace in the study. She pleads with him for help, but he says he has no choice, but offers her a ten-second head start before he alerts the others. Alex deactivates the security cameras and unlocks the doors of the house. However, he is captured and restrained by the family when they discover his betrayal. Grace tears her wedding gown to free her legs for mobility and arms herself. She manages to escape the kitchen after eluding the family butler Stevens (John Ralston), scalding him with boiling water. The family members regroup and lament the difficulty in killing Grace but reiterate they must do so before sunrise. During this discussion, Emilie accidentally kills a third maid with a crossbow through the head. Stevens informs the family Grace has escaped outside but promises to capture her. Grace hides in the barn, there she is shot in the hand by Emilie's son Georgie (Liam MacDonald), falling into the ""goat pit"" where the family have hidden the remains of previous victims. Grace manages to climb out and escapes through a fence, injuring herself further, and fails to stop a passing motorist for help. On the road, Stevens chases after Grace in a car, but she manages to temporarily disable him and takes the car after gets out. She tries to call for help using the vehicle assistance company, but the car was reported stolen and the car is disable remotely, allowing Stevens to tranquilize and capture Grace. Stevens drives her back to the estate, but Grace wakes up and causes him to crash the car, killing him. Grace runs, but Daniel discovers her, knowing that Tony is secretly watching, he knocks her out again and recaptures her. The Le Domas family prepares to sacrifice Grace in a Satanic ritual. They each drink from a cup as part of the ritual, but vomit, besides Daniel who has poisoned them all, saying they deserve to die. While Alex escapes his captivity, Daniel frees Grace and they attempt to leave the house. But Daniel is shot and killed by Charity. Grace starts a fire, but the family members ignore it and continue to pursue her. She gets into a fight with Becky and manages to beat her to death with the box. Alex arrives and realises that, even if he lets Grace live, she won't want to be with him, he captures her and alerts the family. The family try again to sacrifice Grace, holding her down. Alex tries to stab her in the heart but misses and stabs her in shoulder. They then see that the sun has come up, meaning it is now too late. As they recoil in horror for their impending death, nothing happens. Helene plans to kill Grace anyway, but as she grabs the axe, she suddenly explodes into a bloody mess. One by one, the other family members look in horror and try to flee as each blow up. Tony pleads for a reprieve to Mr. Le Bail, but to no avail and dies. Last to go, Alex begs Grace for forgiveness, but explodes when Grace demands a divorce. As the house is engulfed in flames, Grace momentarily sees the figure of Mr. Le Bail sitting at the head of the table. He nods in approval and allows her to leave, covered in the blood of the exploded Le Domas family members. Outside the house, Grace sits on the steps as the fire blazes behind her and smokes a cigarette as emergency services arrive. When someone asks her what happened, Grace shrugs and replies: ""In-laws"". Also starring Kate Ziegler as Young Becky. Weaver gives a fantastic as the unsuspecting bride who inadvertently becomes the victim of a deadly game, the other cast members, including an against-type MacDowell, play the aristocratic family with a dark agenda very well. The twisted game of Hide and Seek is the main draw, and the deal with the devil element is clever, there are some thrilling moments, but it not just tense, it is also witty and very funny, with the madness and slaughter being the butt of the joke, a great fun black comedy horror. Very good!","

It's watchable, that I'll admit, there is a bit of suspense, but other than that it's just not a movie I would keep in my collection. Horror and comedy can work but in this case I would just have skipped the comedy part. It was unnecessary and to be honest not that funny. The acting was good for some but bad for others, so even that was disappointing. I read somewhere reviewers comparing it to Get Out, really? If you never seen that one I recommend you that movie. Get Out has everything this movie doesn't have. That's a good movie and not this one.","

Clueless bride slowly (understatement) begins to figure out something is amiss with her new inlaws. Fairly quickly turns into a nonstop chase that begins to bore. Interspersed with creepy humor. The ""humor"" involves the senseless killing of several employees of the family. Not very funny to repeatedly see the villains callously killing people and smirking about it. This movie would have been better without this type of humor. The person being chased must not have ever seen a horror movie before! If she ran like her life depended on it rather than as a soon-to-be dead teenager in a Friday the 13th movie. The pursuers were ineffectual. I was somewhat entertained. I would never watch the movie again and did not care what happened by the end of the movie. Just okay. Not work the $12 I paid to see thyisl","

"neil_loveday-82593","26 September 2019","I have laughed at previous reviews on here slating this film since watching it earlier. I guess people these days just take things too serious these days?? Who knows?
It does remind me of Get Out, and yes, it's not a realistic plot etc, but this isn't a documentary.........I paid to watch a film and be entertained, and I was. It is often very tongue in cheek and silly at times, but these things will amuse you if you watch this with the realisation it won't win oscars.","

"Girivardhan","26 November 2019","Ready or Not is a deranged black comedy that wears its wild-eyed craziness proudly. And the story is set up with a cinematic glossiness, an old-school gleam that matches the well-polished woods and marble of its mansion setting. Star Samara Weaving certainly comes through in her young-bride-turned-terrified-scrapper role with movie star charisma to spare.","

"WasiReviews","24 January 2021","Ready or Not is a horror movie that is both unique and entertaining with the film feeling like Game Night meets the third act of Cabin in the Woods ( not a spoiler). Samara Weaving and Adam Brody were great. I loved how incompetent the family was shown to be, it implies that the only reason for their continued wealth and success was the deal. Her dress getting destroyed symbolizes her innocence slowly fading due to the stuff she had to endure throughout the night. I think the fact that Grace is ""good"" is directly correlated with her getting the hide and seek card. The family worships the devil, therefore the original patriarch wouldn't want such a good genuine person to join the family. Notice how the other two spouses of the siblings aren't very good people, therefore they got to join no problems. Melanie Scrofano as Emilie Le Domas-Bradley, Daniel and Alex's cocaine-addicted sister was flipping hilarious I loved her soo much in this she felt like a dumb blonde character (she has brown hair though) but she isn't overplayed or overtly stupid like Madison in Zombieland Doubletap who I hated with a vengeance. Overall this film wasn't that scary but I will say it was thoroughly entertaining and incredibly gory this is not something a 13-year-old should watch. This is very much a satanic film with worship and brutality. Trust me the gore and devil references are very strong. All the actors and some Canadians (GO CANADA) brought their best act in this film. I can't name them all but I truly thought all of them were great in this film.","

"nicholls905-280-546911","4 January 2020","Ready or Not is a refreshing horror film, that is self aware and funny. The cast is strong and the storyline is well constructed. The standard horror cliches sink it down slightly from time to time, but these are only a slight blip. 2019 had a strong line-up of horror films and this is one of them. The casting of Weaver was the correct choice and similar to You're Next, it doesn't hurt to have the lead actress as a strong person compared to the, just a victim.","

Samara Weaving's acting was so solid and on-point, I thought she was Margot Robbie for the first 45 minutes or so. The theory of why folks sometimes spontaneously combust is finally revealed in all of its perturbing and sanguine grandeur. More dark humor than a Cure album, too. Pretty cool seeing that dude from Sledgehammer again, as well. He didn't blow up the world this time (oops, was that a spoiler?).","

"MarioTee","3 December 2019","Yes, spoilersShould I write anything more than the title? I see this one-lined reviews that rate the movie with 1-3 stars. Some didn't even finish more than 10 minutes and yet feel adequate to trash it. Some don't like profanity in a movie where so many people die. Some find it unoriginal, as there is much room left for originality.
Let me just say this. The movie is not perfect. The main character is not always perfect in her decisions. Seeing ""normal"" people getting crazy because of the card is not that believable. The last minute and the paranormal touch is a bit of mess (they exploded? would be better if they burned or melted, not some quick death).
But the movie is still smart, fun, scary, funny, gory, and very well made. 7.5/10, but in spite of haters, 8/10!","

"GavWaskett","12 September 2020","The Le Domas' have an interesting family history, their ancestor made a deal with a man named Le Bail(French for a Lease if you want a bit of trivia and Le Domas means thought - my Google translate is working overtime today), their family fortune developed from that moment, however, as with all dodgy deals with people you don't know who promise you riches, there is a catch! Every time one of the family marries, they all sit around and the new Le Domas, selects a card with a game on it.Now this card selection, often leads to fin and games and a wedding night to remember, however, ever so often someone pulls out the 'Hide and Seek' card and then what should be for the happy couple a night to remember, becomes a night one part will never forget and the other part, well they won't have the chance to forget!And to this warped family, comes Grace (Samara Weaving), the new wife of Alex (Mark O'Brien), poor Grace, selects the one card that causes problems and the fun and games begin. To be honest, most of the family take more than a little bit of enjoyment from hunting the poor woman and taking pot shots at her. However, she does have the occasional bit of help from some unlikely quarters.Samara Weaving is superb as Grace, portraying her fear, shock and ultimately her feck you attitude. She is the heroine you root for and you quickly turn against the family to support her. Adam Brody as alcoholic brother Daniel is fantastic and his vulnerability and torn relationships are a nice contrast to his bloodthirsty wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), who you cannot help but feel, if she pulled the Hide and Seek card, things would've been a whole lot bloodier, a whole lot quicker and brother in law Bradley (Kristian Bruun) who loves the family money but is a little bit more choosy and his instrument of death. Both Miss Levesque and Mr Bruun create very fun and watchable characters who add to the horror and fun. You also have Andie MacDowell, as the matriarch of the family who just wants to protect her brood.The film is fast, fun and bloody, you really wouldn't want to be a maid at this party - the tips you receive are on the end of a crossbow blot! There are a few queasy moments, a nail at the top of a ladder springs to mind and there's some awesome death scenes. A really fresh idea as well, which in the time of remakes and sequels is really refreshing, a hide behind your hands and count to 17/20.","

Otherwise it's a generic horror flic with little to no tension, due to the fact that there's almost no quiet moments.The only character they got right is the main character itself. In my opinion she plays her part solidly and manages to convey a sense of terror that she is forced to live through. Also some of the imagery is staged beautifully.There was so much unused potential. She never really got face to face with every character for example, the backstory of the ritual wasn't really told in a compelling way and like I've said, there just isn't a lot of tension.I would love for the movie to lean into its supernatural elements a lot more. But hey.","

"stevendbeard","22 August 2019","I saw ""Ready or Not"", starring Samara Weaving-Three Billboards Outside Ebbing,Missouri, Ash vs Evil_tv, Oh and if her name sounds familiar, it's because she is the niece of Hugo Weaving/Mr. Smith, from the Matrix movies; Adam Brody-Shazam!, The O.C._tv; Mark O'Brien-Bad Times at the El Royale, Arrival; Henry Czerny-Revenge_tv, Mission:Impossible and Andie MacDowell-Magic Mike XXL, Groundhog Day.
This is a bloody, funny tale about In_laws From Hell. Samara is a poor girl marrying Mark, a man that comes from a rich family-they made their fortune in games-but he forgets to tell her about a family tradition. At midnight, on their wedding night, his family welcomes a new person into their family by playing a game. They draw cards to see what they will play, it could be Checkers, Old Maid or in this case, Hide & Seek. Henry & Andie are Mark's parents and Adam is Mark's brother. Mark tells Samara that they should just elope-he can't tell her why because of his family and their rules-but Samara wants to be accepted by the family and decides to play the game. Henry tells Samara that the rules of the game are that she must stay hidden until dawn. Samara soon finds out that the game is being played seriously and they are really trying to kill her before dawn or there will be consequences for the seekers. Although it is violent and bloody, there are lots of humor in it, too. There aren't any scenes at the end but if you do stay, there is someone that says, 'Ready or not, here I come!' at the very end.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, bloody images, language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.","

"jordanjanssen","2 September 2019","Oh dear. What a silly film.Poor girl marries into rich family who have a ritual for anyone joining the family to play a randomly selected game. Poor Grace gets the 'Hide and Seek' card, which means the rich folk (including young grade school age kids) hunt her with the intent to kill her.The film started quite earnestly in trying to be a creepy weirdo family house of horrors and rapidly descended into vacuous exhibition of digital gore. People in the cinema were laughing out loud most of the way through, and not in a good way!I only went to see this as an Odeon 'screen unseen' in the U.K. and because I have a cinema pass. If I had paid my £14 for a ticket, I would have been very unhappy about it. As it was, my companions got in for £5 each, which is all this film is worth.If you've seen a genuinely scary film, you'll want to give this a miss. The moniker of 'comedy' is more apt than 'suspense, horror, thriller' as shown on IMDb.Save yourself the money, and have a giggle at this when it arrives on satellite TV.","

"Coventry","2 July 2020","They're going to find her. And make her suffer...Sorry, but when you see that title, how can you not automatically complete the lyrics of the 1996 smash-hit by The Fugees? Anyway, ""Ready or Not"" is a very entertaining and surprisingly competent action/horror ride with a strong feminine protagonist, a healthy dose of humor and a handful of inventively gory gimmicks. I state ""surprisingly"" competent, because thus far I only knew the directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Oplin from the anthologies ""Southbound"" and ""V/H/S"" and, well, I though they both sucked. This film blends two very familiar horror themes, namely hunting for humans and severely dysfunctional murder-families, but present them in a very fun and enjoyable format. Grace and Daniel celebrate their wedding's day at Daniel's parental estate. It's the first time the bride meets her in-laws, and basically only knows they are a bunch of eccentric rich people whose empire is built on generations of successful boardgames development. At midnight, and according to an ancient tradition, Grace must participate in a game of hide and seek before she's fully accepted into the family. Her wedding night will be wild and nasty, but probably not how she imagined it. If you look past some flaws and improbabilities (like some of the characters implausible behavioral changes) you'll find this an enjoyable movie. The grotesque and bloody finale is hilarious, the hide-and-seek nursery tune is creepy, and the performances are good. It's particularly fun to see Andie MacDowell is a highly unusual role for a change. I swear you'll never look at ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" in the same way again.","

"rockman182","21 August 2019","Hide and seek gone terribly wrong. That's basically the premise for this film. It looked like it could be an extravagant little affair but at the same time looked like a film that could be awfully disappointing. By now, you know me and know that I don't turn down seeing any film and will watch pretty much anything. Ready or Not was no exception. I did enjoy the theme and gory cat and mouse for the most part in this film although the film does drag itself down when it tries to delve too much into its characters.The film is about a recently married couple, where the bride is spending the wedding night with her husbands mysterious but rich family. The family proposes to honor an age old tradition and play a game where the bride draws a card and they fulfill the game. She draws ""hide and seek"" which turns out to be a bloody, murderous game where the bride must hide as members of her in law family try to murder her before dawn to avoid a curse that will occur to them.The film delivers on its dark humor, gothic mansion setting, and humor here and there which is great because its what the film needs. Samara Weaving is a star in the making and I'm all for it. She is a character you back to escape and she really gets into the element that the role requires. The film brings a good amount of blood and violence which will satisfy those looking for an entertaining thriller. The film does spend too much time trying to have moments of ""emotion"" between characters and its winded and feels like it.The film becomes utterly ridiculous as it goes along but its hard to look away. Its a different type of film and I had a pretty good time with it which is all I could hope for from a B movie that only exists to be humorous, violent fun. If you want a fun tale of survival over the course of a night then this will do the trick. Just don't expect anything amazing. Side note, its nice to see Adam Brody from The O.C. all grown up.6.5/10","

"fntstcplnt","28 August 2019","Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpen & Tyler Gillett. Starring Samara Weaving, Mark O'Brien, Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, Andie MacDowell, Nicky Guadagni, Elyse Levesque, Melanie Scrofano, Kristian Bruun, John Ralston, Hanneke Talbot. (R)Weaving marries into the fabulously wealthy Le Domas clan, unaware of their unusual tradition of playing a game after each family wedding; the game this time is hide-or-seek, and these upper class rapscallions play for keeps. Delicious black comedy disguised as a horror movie has lots of devilish laughs and plentiful bloodletting; not quite as clever as one might hope, and the chase is more fitful than fluid (almost like one of the board games that made the family its fortune), but it's still good, grisly fun all the way with some sly potshots at class and heritage. The groom (O'Brien) has the personality of wallpaper (the absence of relationship chemistry between him and his new bride is unfortunate) and Brody's conflicted drunk can be a buzzkill as often as a laconic wag, but the rest of the sordid family each have their share of wicked (and wickedly funny) moments; the deadliest weapon brandished onscreen is Guadagni's hysterically withering glare. Weaving, however, steals the show as the most memorable bride-on-the-brink since Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill""; based on the evidence here, she's a star in the making. The audacious climax is a high-wire act that could have easily turned disastrous; it may not completely stick the landing, but one has to admire its macabre moxie.75/100","

"filipemanuelneto","12 December 2023","How many times we, common contributors, do not think of the hypothetical dark side that would like to exist in those rich families of business, politics and the arts? For many people, envy is very natural. Others, like me, are more concerned with the lawful origin of fortunes (what matters to me is that the rich honestly earn their money, the rest I feel it does not concern me) and others think that, since money is so earthly and perhaps evil, all great fortunes have some dose of perversity. Unlike people like me, who face money as a tool that can be well used or not, there are a lot of people who associate this malevolent load with money.This movie begins around this wealthy family and creates a story of Satanism, carnage and lack of scruples. Everything is set on the wedding of the Patriarch's firstborn son. The young bride, for his family to accept her, will have to play a mysterious traditional game that they all have to play at a given moment. A crazy initiation ritual in a hunting room full of weapons and embalmed animals. What follows is the predictable carnage. And I say predictable because the movie is stupidly easy to guess, which is the weak point of the plot. As a horror movie, it will only work for those who have a weak stomach for bloody scenes: yes, the movie has a lot of gore, but I've seen worse.Technically, the movie has its ups and downs. Taking advantage of the places that the production has achieved to shoot in Canada, including a famous museum-mansion, sets and costumes are excellent and worthy of a much more expensive thing. It is not a low-budget movie, it is obvious the producer has invested in the project, but it does not seem to be the first bet for a movie season: convincing and effective visual and sound effects help a lot and the editing was well performed. The soundtrack has its moments, but in contrast, cinematography is excessively trembled and occasionally poorly framed.With such apparently heavy bets, it was a shame to feel the production went to seek a third-ranking cast. The protagonists are not bad, but they lack the experience of first water projects with more calloused colleagues: Samara Weaving made a secondary character in ""Three Billboards..."", Mark O'Brian went to do another in ""Arrival"" and Adam Brody participated In ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith "", but it's that. They are actors competing for their space in the sunlight, a rightful desire, but without experience and perhaps a little raw. Truth be told, the movie also does not give them challenging characters or complex situations. The best actress here is Andie MacDowell, but it is far from showing the qualities we saw in her oldest work. Canadian Henry Czerny does what he can and is remarkable, but cannot save the movie alone.","

"cruise01","3 September 2019","Ready or Not (4 out of 5 stars).Ready or Not is a bloody fun time with a cheesy concept idea and plot and some suspense and thrills. Kind of like a cheesy horror movie like Cabin in the Woods. A simple and weird plot idea. But throw in some cheesy script and direction which does make it entertaining. Ready or Not worked with the idea.The plot follows Grace (Samara Weaving) who got married to Alex (Mark O'Brien) whose family is rich and have an empire in the gaming business. The family has a weird tradition on the wedding night. Grace has to play a game and this mystery box tells them they have to play hide and seek. With a twist. She has to hide and the family has their set of weapons and they have to go hunting for her.There is a little more to plot that reveals the family true reasoning with the game. Which has a family history of a tradition that they have to do. There is a twist that gets very bloody in the climax. Literally from the characters getting stabbed to fighting back. Even bodies exploding. Feels like Quentin Tarantino idea of a movie.The movie moves at a fast pace. Grace is on the run and avoiding the family until dawn. Every encounter has her fighting for her life and avoiding danger. While the family is slowly losing control of their hunting game. Which they are very desperate in trying to get her before dawn. Before something else happens.The script is a bit cheesy with the acting and funny. The direction also delivers some thrills and suspense. Not really scary at all. Samara Weaving delivered a great performance. Probably the most freaked out performance of the year. Love how her character is wearing the bride dress throughout. Until, she gets worn down and messy and bloody while trying to survive. Adam Brody also delivered playing Daniel, which he is the brother in law who is tired from the family tradition.Overall, Ready or Not is a good thriller of a film. It delivers plenty of thrilling moments and some cheesy humor. It can be a bit bloody. The story is cheesy with its set up but at least it is fun.","

"rgkarim","21 August 2019","Robbie K back in the trenches for another movie review, this time looking at yet another horror movie to hopefully bring with a number of warped imaginations to life. Some of them bring us into the disturbing zone and leave us scarred, others manage to be quirky cult thrillers that lead to endless sequels, and others are so bad they somehow stay good. Tonight, the horror movie looks to be a hybrid of a thriller meeting said horror, with promise of being a romping good time. Yet, the trailers can certainly be a mask for something else. Read on to check out my thoughts on:Movie: Ready or Not (2019)Directors:
Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett
Writers:
Guy Busick, Ryan Murphy
Stars:
Samara Weaving, Adam Brody, Mark O'Brien
LIKES:Good Acting
Decent Suspense
Pace
Quirky
Funny
Lives Pretty Close To What The Trailer PromisesDISLIKES:Predictable
Not Scary
A Little Too Silly
The Ending Sort Of
Focus On Blood at timesSummary:We get that these types of movies often do not have the best acting, but in this film the cast actually brings some effort into making believable characters that aren't too annoying. My lead is Samara Weaving who has the comical role down, but Adam Brody is a solid second actor to craft the believable brother struggling to handle the situation before them. As the rest of the cast plays essentially sadistic players in the mad games of chance, these carbon copy roles are all about trying to bring the suspense factor to the movie. Ready Or Not achieves the suspense decently, keeping a nice pace to keep the action going and the horrors at least coming. Thus, the thriller aspect is very well achieved in this movie. Yet, another element that I liked was the quirkiness of this film, primarily in the form of the presentation. Ready or Not is one of those movies that manages to find a stride with the cheesy gimmicks, putting a comedic spin on things without being too forced in your face. Perhaps it's the subtle comedy of the overzealous aunt, the clumsiness of the sister, or maybe just the reactions of the main character Grace, but there is something in the writing and presentation that makes it just fun. As an added bonus, the film also manages to achieve pretty close what the trailer provides, leaving some surprises to enjoy, and yet still not diverging down the pathways it could have taken.In regards to dislikes, the predictability of the movie is okay, some parts due to the trailers and other parts laid out in writing with heavy foreshadowing. This predictability not only ruins some of the surprise, but it also diminished the horror element of the movie as well. Ready Or Not's thriller is the selling point, for the jump scares are few, the creep factor is low, and there are seldom any moments that had me on the edge of my seat. This could also be due to the comical side of things and the fact they focused so much on the ridiculousness of the plot to help tone down the creep and scare factor. Maybe taking things the silly route wasn't the best route for this one, especially giving the ending, which to me is a mixed like and dislike. On the one hand the ending falls in line with the silliness of the movie and sort of just naturally occurs leaving you satisfied. On the other hand, the movie's ending led to not quite getting the hunt fest I had thought I was going to see. Like the most dangerous game or a final destination I had kind of thought members of this household would have altercations that were do or die. Yet as you will see, this in not quite the case and there is little more I can say without ruining anything so onward we move. My final component is the gore factor of this movie. Certainly not the worst thing, Ready Or Not does sometimes get a little too fixated on the blood factor for my tastes. Those who aren't fans of seeing suffering, skin crawling spectacles of crimson colored chaos need to turn away, as there are some gut-wrenching moments that aren't for the faint hearted.Overall, the adventure of Ready Or Not is a fun little project that is campy, quirky, and still thrilling in the world of horror films. With an engaging cast and concept, it's a movie that will keep the audience hooked and perhaps make them laugh at the odd sense of comedy and justice that they brought in this film. And though it matches the tone of the trailers, at times the comedy may have diluted the thriller anticipation you might have though. For the hunt sort of gets caught up in the blood and comedy rather than delivering the full-on horror chills. Still, the film is a fun watch and probably good for a small group to hit the theaters with or watch at home.My scores are:Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0","

"aciessi","25 August 2019","Ready or Not is exactly what the end of summer needed. A quietly released indie that comes alive on the screen as an old-fashioned horror bloodbath. Take Clue and The Most Dangerous Game, and mash them together. You'll get this. Olpin and Gillett are a directing duo to continue looking out for. Once the games begin, they make sure to keep the hits coming. In Samara Weaving, a star is born, again. She's horror's next big scream queen. No really, she's got an EPIC shriek. For a lack of better phrasing. Just as fun to watch is Henry Cherny as the wildly over-the-top Le Domas patriarch. Aside from some minor character issues, this film has a nice flow throughout, with increasing adrenaline and tension. While at the same time, teeming with self-awareness and gleeful fun.","

Ready or not is based on a loving couple called Grace ( Samara Weaving) and Alex ( Mark o brien) but in order to be accepted into into the family Grace must play a game with them with drastic and disturbing consequences for everyone. Ready or not had such a big potential to be good but largely fell flat for me the film was just mediocre. Lets talk about why.Lets start with a positive however. The plot was fairly unique and something i hadn't seen before. The whole plot was interesting to me. Having a family so adamant that they have to kill anyone who comes into the family was an interesting concept. And it made the film enjoyable for doing something different despite the poor execution.Next i thought the use of gore was fantastic. The gore really left an impact with each scene that it was in. It also really kept you on the edge of your seat as there was some admittedly uncomfortable scenes involving crushing of bones. But that just shows the director is achieving there desired reaction. And i thought the gore looked surprisingly realistic despite its very small budget.Next however i would like to say that the film was painfully predictable. Pretty much every character had the generic role within the film and hardly any of them stood out in a interesting way at all. You
could tell what was going to happen at the end because they told you what would happen so therefore most of the film was pretty pointless. It was a shame as the plot was different its just the ingredients within the plot everyone had seen before.Next despite in my opinion the film being tonally unsure about what genre it is the film was actually pretty funny. Despite some of the characters such as the loopy one who accidentally kills everyone was admittedly funny despite it maybe not supposed to be funny. It was a strange one as i felt that the film was more of a comedy but i don't know or think this was the movies goal. And it had moments with the acting and the script where it was so bad it was good/funny.Adding onto the previous point the script for this film was absolutely terrible. Some of the things that most of the characters was ridiculous and cringey. It made a large majority of the characters seem incredibly dumb. The script was fairy strong for the lead actress but it just felt like they didn't bother with any of the other characters.Next i thought the acting from the lead actors Mark o brian and Samara weaving was pretty good. Both of there performances held the film together in my opinion. Mark o brien put on a very believable performance of the struggle between loyalty to his family and the love for his wife and he did solid acting here. But the real star of this film was Samara weaving. She was fantastic in Ready or not and should be a big star in the future. She did an excellent performance in portraying the slow mental breakdown of her character after slowly realising what family she married into. The script for her was fantastic and relatable and really made you connect with her character. And both of these characters bough a relatable and good theme about wanting to impress other members of the family and Ready or not tackled this very well. And the only other good performance and character was Adam Brody. He bought the most comedy and was the only family member that wasn't the two leads that did a good performance. You could tell throughout the film how conflicted he was in terms of were his loyalties lie and his death was admittedly sad.And my final positive before i get into the main points that bought the film down. The film did manage to execute a very tense tone well. The film despite lacking in jumpscares did have many tense scenes that were mostly achieved and elevated by Samara Weavings performance. The fact that you genuinely didn't know when a member of the family was going to find the lead protagonist was an interesting way at keeping the tense tone consistent we will get onto the overall tone soon.Now for my final three negatives that really bought the film down for me. First of all the film was completely tonally inconsistent. This movie did not know what genre it wanted to be at all. It was supposed to be a horror and a comedy but there was not enough of either in order to justify what the movie was trying to do. It wasn't that funny and it certainly wasn't scary and the film had some moments where it was supposed to be funny but it was just pure toe curling cringe. And the whole film just felt so amateurish. You could just tell the director was new to the game and didn't really know what they were doing.And finally there was many lapses in logic and the ending was just terrible. There was many scenes especially towards the end that were either ridiculous or did not make sense in the slightest. The lead character jumped a really high distance and was absolutely fine and considering the amount of injuries she sustained throughout the whole film i was surprised but glad she was alive. And the whole point of Adam brodys character poisining his family members was for Samara weaving character to escape but it literally did nothing to them despite him saying it will make them very drowsy. And finally the ending was terrible when Grace survived until dawn and nothing happened to the family it firstly made the characters and the film look stupid but there was just a massive awkward silence. And when they did explode like they said they would it just was ridiculous and made the whole film pointless.Overall Ready or not is held together by the fantastic performance by Samara weaving and had potential to be great. But fell flat due to poor directing,acting,execution of the plot and its tonal inconsistencies.","

"Catocala","31 October 2022","Ready or Not is one of those movies that really knows what it is and doesn't pretend to be more than that. The plot is so ridiculous (in-laws force the bride to play a lethal version of hide and seek), but it makes no attempt to pretend to be deep or revolutionary. It just knows what it wants and does its job well.You get the jokes, you get the thrill, you get the over-the-top gore. A dark-comedy with great execution and pretty decent acting. Especially Samara Weaving as the leading lady, really is a leading lady and carries most of the movie when it comes to the acting.I was doubting to give this movie a 7 because it's good within its niche genre, but it is one of those movies that's fun to watch once and nothing really surprising happens. Good entertainment, what you see is what you get, but nothing more than that.","

"NDbportmanfan","10 September 2019","Ready or Not is about a newly wed bride that has to play a game in order to officially be welcomed into the family. The game that is chosen is hide and seek, with the catch being if she is found... well you can tell from the trailers.The one thing this film really does well is keeping the tension high while also supplying well executed humor. Which is vitally crucial in a silly premise such as this one. The sister's husband plays a role that embodies the audience as he is questioning the games logic, pageantry, and real end game. His humor along with his wife really makes the movie memorable.Much like real hide and seek the entire thrill comes out of the high tension hiding moments and the sporadic running scenes. These are thrilling and they felt more intense because the writers wrote a character that seems a little deeper than other scream queens of the recent past. We are even given a character in Daniel that helps carry the story when she isn't in the picture.Once we get past all the thrill and kill moments comes the third act or more importantly the end. This had all the momentum going into it from the previous scenes, but the end just falls flat. Honestly they should have added another 20 minutes to this as I would assume audiences are wanting more to the lore, or maybe that is just me. Where it stands now its okay because it was out there and few probably would expect it but you will go away thinking it had a lot more potential.This movie should be watched but there is nothing spoiler heavy that waiting until a home release wouldn't be the most viable option. I can see myself watching this one again in the future.","

"hnapel","24 November 2019","Samara Weaving, I'm not sure that is a household name already but after this I think it should be. All hail to the casting agencies who can find the perfect face for the perfect character. What I like about this movie, while it may not be exactly a horror story is its realism that is only violated in the very end but then it is executed which such perfect justice and accompanied by such ironic laughter from Samara that whoever came up with it is totally exonerated for its in-credulousness. This is a dark movie, bodies are drawn from the living at a steady pace and the killings are as brutal as they are fanciful. A head is chopped off with an ax I will give you and for the rest go watch it thank you very much. There's a dark kind of humor to psychopaths and this movie is full of it. The cringing, hurting moments invoke true horror because you can so easily relate to them, the strength of those scenes is that they are so close to the bone, the spine is a bone right? The movie stays close to the face of the main character, which is always a satisfaction when it is a pretty one, and in our desire to understand it we are exposed to all its evolving expressions as it attains more grit while the story develops in an ongoing escalation of violence. Believe me, the curse is real, this is a serious game.","

"arungeorge13","1 December 2019","It'd been a while since I've sat down to watch a comedy-horror flick and when Ready or Not caught my attention, I was sure to give it a go. That said, I wasn't particularly fond of the director duo's earlier work - Devil's Due, and a segment (or was it two?) in Southbound and V.H.S. But the genre continues to intrigue me and that was the reason I decided to watch Ready or Not.For starters, my decision turned out to be a great one. Not only does Ready or Not manage to entertain for a good 95 minutes, but it also serves fair justice to the comedy-horror fanbase. Led by a fantastic Samara Weaving (playing Grace, who's just married and brought to her husband's house to partake in a rather uncanny midnight ritual) and a fantastic supporting cast (featuring the likes of Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, Andie MacDowell, and more), Ready or Not offers an engaging mix of dark humor and survival-horror.The storyline isn't the most original one you'll come across for a film such as this. Yet, the director-duo pack in enough twists and tricks to keep viewers engrossed throughout its run-time. The (another-level) dysfunctional family was both fun and creepy in their own ways. Weaving is in top form here, conveying the transition from yaay-just-married-bliss to straight-up-shocked in convincing fashion. I liked her (mostly improv) reactions in the latter half of the movie where she has to fend for herself while in an incredible amount of pain. Adam Brody is pretty great too, and thankfully, he doesn't take the thunder away from Weaving in any of their combination scenes.The mansion and its surroundings could have been creepier (the lighting is excellent and works in favor of the film's overall tone) but otherwise, I'd deem them okayish. The edits are crisp and that helps for a film which is set in a limited setting and the entire storyline is basically a one-liner. What works in Ready or Not lies in its execution of a concept that's low-hanging fruit these days: commonplace scenarios turning wacky all of a sudden, the one-too-many jabs at rich people and the extremes that they resort to, and a lady (in distress) at the forefront of it all.In essence, it may seem like the R-rated version of The Hunger Games with a few funny lines and situations thrown in, but Ready or Not gets the job done in amusing its viewers and sometimes, that's just about enough.",NA

"Abranth-d","13 September 2019","Here's my review of 'Ready or not' . So 'ready or not stars Samara weaving who happens to be a Margot Robbie lookalike . The movie's about a girl who marries into a super rich family who have a tradition of playing a game , one of which involves playing hide and seek but the other members of the family have to kill her before Dawn . That's just about it. It's a neatly directed claustrophobic horror movie which has elements of black comedy in and out. That's something I loved about this movie. The tonal shift from funny to scary to weird is so fast in this movie and yet doesn't feel odd anywhere. The music was also gripping and helped with the setup for most jumpscares. I don't usually talk film school , but the lighting in this movie was gorgeous . The only gripes I had were with the use of shaky cam in certain scenes . Other than that , it was a pretty good b grade flick with gore , action and thrills. The ending however ... That was unexpected .",NA
"bonehead821","21 August 2019","What I got was a very dry dark comedy that just basically gives up at the end (and wastes kills). As a hardcore slasher fan, I went in looking for some decent kills, and maybe a decent survivor girl, but you get none of that with this. I can't even remember one single kill. It was just a bunch of offscreen stuff and quick shots of aftermath gore.If you're a slasher fan looking for some good kills, skip this one, it's not made for you.",NA
"carolinephillips-47427","23 August 2019","It's rare that a big, mainstream studio horror film comes out and actually delivers. Ready or Not is one of the rare cases when it does. Samara Weaving is a charming and likable heroine who must deal with her fiance's bizarre family wedding rituals that include a deadly game of hide and seek.Weaving's character doesn't get much in terms of backstory, which might have helped out a bit, but Weaving's abundance of charm and quirky tics make her feel better developed than she is and we're on her side the entire time.The supporting cast featuring familiar faces like Andie McDowell (in her horror film debut if I'm correct) and Adam Brody (who gets much more to do here than he did in his other horror comedies Scream 4 and Jennifer's Body).Throughout the film, you'll find yourself cringing at scenes of nails entering hands or people falling into messy pits of dead bodies in between laughing fits due to the witty dark comedy. Horror comedy is tricky to pull off, but Ready or Not pulls it off beautifully with a healthy amount of suspense and laughs in equal measure.Ready or Not is a must see horror-comedy event!",NA
