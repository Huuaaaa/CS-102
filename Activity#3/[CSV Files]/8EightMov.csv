"evanston_dad","7 August 2017","James McAvoy gives what could have potentially been an award-worthy performance if it had appeared in a different film.He plays a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps three young girls as a part of a plot two of the personalities have hatched to unleash a powerful and unstoppable identity. Betty Buckley, in a better performance than the role necessarily needed, plays a therapist working with him and who begins to unravel the alarming plot. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, who hasn't made a movie I've wanted to see since ""Signs,"" crafts a nifty and effective thriller with three fourths of his film, and then sort of if not completely ruins it by taking his idea too far and pushing the supernatural elements to the point where we realize we're not even watching the same kind of movie we were at the beginning. This particular story, and especially McAvoy's performance, would have been compelling enough without Shyamalan's characteristic inability to understand when he's ruining his own premise.Grade: B","

"arniecage","2 July 2018","A fantastic performance by the film's star, James McAvoy is reason alone to watch this film. Every personality on display is distinct to the other, and he is so interesting to watch. Anya who was breath-taking in The Witch does a fine job here too. This is a film where M. Night Shyamalan reasserts himself as a serious director following a string of poor films. I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel and the conclusion of the Unbreakable series arriving in January. 8.5/10.","

"zlifb","13 August 2018","What a remarkable film! The premise of the film seems quite superficial at first but as the layers are peeled back there's so much more beneath.It's a horror film without special effects gore, an action flick without any car chases. A high-tension psychological thriller for viewers with active imaginations, who don't need to be spoon-fed every explanation.The acting is top-notch, the script sympathetic, the cinematography and set fantastic, and the music/sound subtle enough not to be noticed, consciously, while building the tension inexorably. It's gripping, un-turn-away-able.Seriously impressive. I don't give 10's lightly.","

"TheMovieDiorama","27 February 2018","Ahhhhhh I am so disappointed with this! I really wanted to love it, it ticks all the right boxes for a decent thriller. Yet somehow Shyamalan missed the mark. It's not bad, in fact it's crafted intricately...just not great. A man with 23 different personalities abducts three young girls as he prepares to unleash the 24th personality that dominates the others. This is extremely difficult to review. For every positive outcome there is a negative to counteract it. For example: Kevin's internal survival against the other personalities was an intriguing and compelling concept. However, the enthralling psychological analysis was negated by the stupidity of this whole 24th personality that is able to physically change Kevin. A thought provoking theme is decimated by an unrealistic concept in an attempt to be dramatic. It didn't need to be! The first act was going so well with interesting ideas that Shyamalan clearly has an interest in. His focus on this multiple personality disorder shows in the film. Patient and psychologist conversations take place that explains Kevin's fractured mind. Then it constantly shifts to the thriller aspect where these three young girls are trying to escape from a sinister location. It's not exciting. At all. These girls aren't put in any real danger or hardly attempt to flee so what's the point? They just exist for the finale which as a result makes the film absurdly boring. These girls are lifeless. Except Taylor-Joy's character who actually has some decent backstory, told through flashbacks. Split is a tool for James McAvoy to showcase multiple fantastic performances. Genuinely creepy and unnerving. His ability to automatically switch characters was faultless and found him to be highly enjoyable. Also like the final scene which harks back to a certain film which I shall not name. I look forward to future prospects. But in the end, Split was a failed attempt at a thriller but an intriguing psychological drama. It's unfortunate the two just didn't blend for me.","

"crberme","22 October 2017","I was surprised to see that this movie was released last year (as I'm writing this) and I didn't heard about it, taking in consideration how promising the plot is.Split is about three girls get kidnapped by a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID) that has 23 personalities. I have to say that this movie does not represent what DID really is and how people who struggle with it are, mainly because this movie gets a bit too fantastical sometimes. It doesn't try to be strictly realistic though, so it's an awesome thriller anyway.The movie gives you chills since the very start with an awesome acting by James McAvoy and some seriously good still scenes. The overall scenes make you have a weird feeling, something it succeeds to transfer to the viewer that you probably won't be able to describe. That makes this thriller stand out in a good way.Maybe Split makes a unrealistic representation of dissociative identity disorder, and that can be a big turnoff, but this is a great movie nonetheless.","

"sherryismyrealtor","2 July 2017","This movie will keep you watching waiting for the next character coming out of James McAvoy. He should have won some awards for his performance of a man with many different personalities. James was very convincing in every part he played. The end is great but I don't want to give anything away so I won't comment on that at all. Well written and the actors were perfect. Watch it today, just don't make the mistake of downloading a different movie called Split about bowling. I did that and that is one of the worst movies I ever saw!","

"Sleepin_Dragon","1 February 2017","Whether you've enjoyed or loathed the last few movies from M Night Shyamalan I don't think any of us could disagree the talent is still there, and after a few misfires comes Split. I can say unequivocally that this is the best thing I have watched in a long time time.The first thing I think this film will be remembered for is the stellar performance of lead actor James Mcavoy, a wonderfully charismatic and talented actor, I'm sure most of us adore, I feel here he's announced himself as a serious contender for mega roles. His ability to switch from one persona to another, to be dark, sinister, camp, soft, cute etc. is incredible, people sat around me watching the movie were stunned at how good he was. The Dennis, Hedwig and Patricia characters in particular show his total versatility.A brilliant supporting cast, Betty Buckley did a fantastic job as Kevin's doctor, as did the trio of girls, Anya Taylor-Joy I thought was especially good.I make it sound like he's the only reason to see the film, far from it, the opening is gripping, the story itself so chilling, and the ending a real surprise.I implore you, see this in the cinema.","

"grantss","13 November 2017","A man kidnaps three teenage girls and holds them prisoner in a basement. He has multiple personality disorder, and is the prize patient of Dr Karen Fletcher, who is using him as case study in the condition. Several of his 23 personalities make their appearance to the girls. While none of them seem particularly harmful, there are indications that there lurks inside of him an ultra-strong and violent personality, The Beast.Written and directed by M Night Shyamalan, I was hoping this would be a return to something like the form of his earlier films. Yes, it would be difficult to match the brilliance of The Sixth Sense but something approaching great would be a good start. Unfortunately his trajectory over the last 11 years or so has been decidedly downwards with some monumentally bad movies - The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender (plus, probably, After Earth - I haven't seen it but apparently it is incredibly bad).So I was quite disappointed when I actually watched this, especially in the first half of the movie. Script, by Shyamalan, is weak, and padded. There was heaps of potential in the concept and themes but this is not used effectively.The biggest problem is that the initial plot is contrived and implausible. It hinges on you believing that the three girls would allow themselves to be held captive. They have plenty of opportunities to overwhelm the captor, but don't, and even when they actually figure on doing that we have a very weak and contrived reason for them not doing it.Plus there is a lot of padding to the movie. While the captor's visits to Dr Fletcher do add some depth to his character(s) and to her side of the story, much of it is unnecessary.So for the first half (even more) I was mostly sitting there thinking ""This is so unrealistic, just escape already!"" and getting bored at some of the discussions.It gets more intriguing and exciting in the second half, and starts to make more effective use of the multiple personality device, but that doesn't make up for the poor start.Can't fault the performances though. James McAvoy is great as the captor, having to essentially play about nine roles, and have to switch between them in a heartbeat. Anya Taylor-Joy is solid as Casey, with good support from Betty Buckley, as Dr Fletcher, and Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula as the other two kidnapped girls.On the whole, not great, and certainly not in the same league as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable or even The Village, but better than most of the stuff M Night Shyamalan has dished up over the last 11 years. A step in the right direction, at least.","

"BremenDruid","13 May 2017","Let me start off by saying that I haven't really like Shyamalan's work since ""Unbreakable"", but I have to admit that this movie made me believe in his vision again. I gave him another chance after hearing so many people raving about this movie, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellently acted, directed and thought out movie. It's intense, funny at some parts, and it is incredibly well thought out. Don't listen to haters just because they don't like Shyamalan's movies. Check it out for yourself and make your own decision.","

"LloydBayer","6 February 2017","What a terrific comeback for Shyamalan! Many have been vocal that horror writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has been on a downward spiral after having peaked with Unbreakable, his very own superhero origins film. Split sees the continuation of Shyamalan's tryst with the supernatural but also a long awaited rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to resurface. While his last film - The Visit - was predictable but entertaining, Split underscores his storytelling prowess with the high level of creativity that made him a household name in contemporary horror.Yet fans will concur that Split isn't just a comeback either, rather a tactical setup of Shyamalan's very own cinematic universe. Put literally, the film is about a person with multiple personalities where each personality speaks collectively in full awareness of the rest. Although main character Kevin is said to exhibit 23 personalities, we see just a handful during most of the film. There's Barry, a New York fashionista, Hedwig, a goofy 9-year-old, and darker personalities Patricia and Dennis. Calling themselves The Horde, the latter two have influenced the abduction of three high school girls as a ritualistic sacrifice for the 24th personality often referred to as ""The Beast"". The girls have limited time before The Beast is unleashed and although paralysed by fear, their escape depends on protagonist Casey's (Anya Taylor-Joy) proactive deconstruct of the good and evil personalities that reside in Kevin. To her advantage and through revelatory flashbacks, we learn that this wouldn't be the first time Casey would confront a monster.If Edward Norton's dual personalities was chilling in his debut film Primal Fear, wait till you get a load of James McAvoy in what is simply an outstanding performance of versatility (or should I say two dozen performances in one film?). More than just a demanding role to pull off, McAvoy's broad range in this film has also elevated what could have been a familiar antagonist into a nerve wrecking supervillain. Which is why Shyamalan's so called signature twist ending is almost astounding. To be honest there isn't an actual twist in the story, but the ending is an unexpected but seamless integration into a sort of trilogy that will have most viewers gob smacked. It's an inside joke and almost as if Shyamalan is asking if we have you been watching closely, but also an extremely rewarding Easter egg for every true fan of the man. Welcome back Mr. Shyamalan!","

"roniksharma","1 October 2016","Shyamalan had his debut with the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' followed by positively reviewed movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. After that, he went through a series of duds with 'Lady In The Water' , 'The Village' , 'The Happening' , 'After Earth' and was termed one of the worst directors of all time with 'The Last Airbender'. But, he made a decent comeback with 2015's 'The Visit' which received generally positive reviews and he's back at his game with 'Split'.After a birthday party, three girls, led by Casey, are kidnapped by the troubled Kevin, who has a very rare case of 23 split personalities inside him. What follows is how the three girls try to escape from Kevin who himself is lowly having a mental breakdown. Sorry, I can't tell a lot about this movie as a small factor would spoil it.This movie couldn't have worked without James McAvoy. He has given his best performance in his whole career and stands out as one of the reasons to watch this movie. The cliché points in the movie are watchable just because of his phenomenal performance. His transition from a 'Norman Bates' type woman Patrica to a 9 year old boy Hedwig to other personalities are amazingLast but not the least, is the traditional ""Shyamalan Twist"". Trust me, this time your minds will be blown when you come to the conclusion. This twist doesn't match up to the ""The Sixth Sense"" one but it's a thrilling one. It's not some stupid twist like in ""Signs"". I won't forget that moment when someone behind me shouted out ""WHAAAAT?!"".""Split"" isn't scary, it's tense. This movie shouldn't have been given a ""horror"" tag. A ""psychological thriller"" sounds better. Nevertheless, this movie is worth a watch. I'm giving a 8/10 with one extra star just for James McAvoyWelcome back, M.Night Shyamalan","

"kirbylee70-599-526179","11 June 2017","There are some director's whose name alone brings forth images of the films they have made. If you hear Hitchcock you know a slow paced thriller is on the way. Spielberg? Normally a family styled big budget adventure. And when you hear M. Night Shyamalan you expect something different. Not always the same but unlike most movies you will see. That holds true with his latest release SPLIT.As the film opens three young girls are kidnapped with no clue who is behind it or where they've been taken. Rather than a simple hostage movie we're seeing something different. The girls find their kidnapper to be stern and unwilling to give into their pleas for help. But then they see him again. Except that it's not quite him.This is when we learn that the kidnapper, Kevin (James McAvoy) is suffering from dissociative identity disorder or what most people would call multiple personalities. When he shows up to the rooms they're being held in wearing a dress and telling them his name is Patricia the girls have no idea what to think. Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), the outsider of the trio, insists that they bide their time to figure a way out. The other two girls are more impulsive and act without thinking things through.When they meet ""Hedwig"" Casey thinks she may have found someone who can help her. She spends time gaining his trust and learning more about what is going on. He tells her about ""The Beast"" and warns that he is coming. When she later asks the ""others"" about ""The Beast"" she is rebuffed but learns just a little more with each conversation.Do the girls escape as the film moves forward? I'd rather not say and allow the story to surprise and unravel for each of you. But the movie does move on with more information gathered in various ways. One of those is the discussions between Kevin and his psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Fletcher has been treating Kevin for some time now and is becoming slightly alarmed via various signs that something has changed.Fletcher doesn't just spend time with Kevin though. While he insist that he is in control she convinces him to allow some of the ""others"" to talk to her. At different visits the multiple people within Kevin's mind are allowed to talk to her and discuss things with her. Each of them provides her with a greater sense of dread that something is happening.Back at the house where the girls are being kept, Casey continues to work her way into the good graces of Hedwig. As the bond between the two of them builds the slightest glimpse of hope appears that perhaps the girls will make it out after all. With no demands made to their parents just why they were kidnapped to begin with comes into question. And when the answer presents itself the level of tension and fear reaches fever pitch. Is there really a ""Beast"" or is that just something in the mind of Kevin.For me Shyamalan has been a hit and miss director. While I've never hated any of his films there have been a few that I felt had fallen a little short of the potential he showed in others. With SPLIT he returns to my good graces with a movie that draws you in, takes it's time to unfold and tells a story unlike any other. In a world of remakes that earns points with me. He definitely gives us something new here.The acting is amazing to watch here. While the entire cast does a fantastic job it is McAvoy who takes center stage and steals the show. It's one thing for an actor to portray a character in a movie. But to create several and have them all well thought out and well done characters? That's something worth paying attention to. The only problem would be trying to figure out which character would be the one receiving an Oscar nomination if it came to that.I noted remakes but what about sequels you might ask. SPOILER ALERT. This film is indeed a sequel but not so much that you would recognize it as such. We've never been exposed to these characters, never seen this world as far as we know and have no inkling that it ties into anything else. That is until the film is just about to hit the credits. At that time we see people talking in a diner and the camera pans down to reveal Bruce Willis sitting there listening to a conversation where someone is trying to recall the name of a terrorist who was in a wheelchair. He tells them the name was Mr. Glass. The name and his presence is a reference to Shyamalan's film UNBREAKABLE. And yes, this film ties into that. As will his next film, one he announced will complete a trilogy bringing all three films together. As a fan of that film I can't wait.Until then I'll be content to watch this movie. And probably more than once. It's one of those films that once you know the end you want to watch again to see what else you can pick up as the story unwinds. That makes it a movie worth not just watching but adding to the collection.","

"austinfromdahood","28 July 2018","Wow, this is my first review on IMDB. Let's start off with the movie that got me interested into film, and that movie is Split. I remember being 13 years old, sitting on my couch a few nights before halloween. I wanted to watch a horror film, so I browsed on the ""Free Movies"" section on Xfinity Demand. I scrolled down the page, and my eyes everted to Split. I read the plot synopsis, and I really liked the concept and watching the film for the first time was one of the best movie watching experiences I've ever had. I was glued to my seat the whole time watching the film and it genuinely scared me. I noticed how the movie builds suspense and I also paid attention to the interesting camera angles the cinematographer chose to shot. After watching the film, I was excited to watch more M. Night Shyamalan films, and that eventually built my love for film. James Mcavoy in this film has an oscar worthy performance, playing 23 different personalities. Anya Taylor Joy also had a very good performance in this film and she played a very interesting character. The techniques for building and showing suspense was masterful in this movie, and the cinematography in this film was golden. The story in this film was also very investing, and its twist and turns are very fun. At first I didn't understand the twist ending, but after browsing the internet, I found out it involved a character from Unbreakable, and watching that movie was also a treat. I'm 14 years old right now, and my passion for film will live on! Split is one of my favorite films of all time and it is a film I will always love.","

"kartiknnagar","24 September 2017","The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the amazing performance by James McAvoy, who is able to effectively and very convincingly portray wildly different characters almost effortlessly with minimal change in physical appearance and entirely through superb acting. One scene in particular has him cycling through three completely different personalities of his character at the drop of a hat, which is quite remarkable. The twist at the end is so disappointing that it is almost non-existent, those who have not watched the movie Unbreakable won't even understand the twist. At least this movie will keep you entertained and is not as atrociously paced as most of M. Night Shymalan's movies.","

"msbreviews","6 August 2017","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)James McAvoy plays Kevin, a man with a genetic disease which allows him to have multiple personalities. His trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), knows 23 of them, but there's one hidden from everyone who desires to dominate over all the others. Compelled by one of his personalities, Kevin abducts three girls, where Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) becomes their leader to try and escape the ""crazy"" man.Is this the return to form by M. Night Shyamalan, who has been struggling for more than a decade to release a major success? Is Split the movie that brings him back to the spotlight?Once again, Shyamalan's storytelling is very original, unconventional and ultimately mind-blowing. Instead of establishing everything the audience needs to know about the characters right at the beginning, he gradually develops them, giving them haunting backstories and spreading parts of it throughout the runtime. That said, this film isn't for everyone. The audience needs to trust Shyamalan and be patient. Really patient. Don't start taking notes about something that you think it's negative because once you reach the third act, everything changes and suddenly it all makes sense. The screenplay is not as twisty as Unbreakable, for example, but it demands absolute attention in order to catch up on all the things that matter (and the ones that don't, as well).The production and editing team have to be congratulated due to their seamless work. From the camera work to the extended one-take sequences, as well as the environment surrounding the characters, everything feels real and looks amazing. The soundtrack ... Let me just say that this element is so, but so much relevant to the conclusion of this movie. I can't really say anything else without spoiling the ending, so I'll leave a note after my rating at the end of the review with a MAJOR SPOILER.As for the cast, I'll start with the man that I honestly think should have received an Oscar nomination: James McAvoy. You know, there's a big difference in portraying a non-fiction character instead of a fiction one: concerning the former, you can't really escape the true nature of the person you are playing, but with the latter, as an actor/actress, you have to deliver yourself 100% to the role for it to be believable ... And God, does McAvoy deliver! He gives 200% in what could be his best performance to date. Do you think Andy Serkis had problems portraying both Gollum and Sméagol at the same time? Well, imagine 7 ... or 8 characters. I lost the count. All in all, James McAvoy, sir, congratulations! You are superb!Anya Taylor-Joy is also incredible as Casey! Her character has the most intriguing story of the three girls, and she's the one who assumes the leadership of the group once the kidnap occurs. Her initially unknown past helps her through the traumatic situation, but it's really her rather captivating backstory that grabbed my attention. It's fundamental to the understanding of the ending and Anya does a terrific job. I also want to give a small praise to Betty Buckley for a beautiful and necessary interpretation of Dr. Fletcher, a character that offers the audience some knowledge of Kevin's disease.As for the other two kidnapped girls, well ... They're my main issue with the film since they don't have a good reason to be there. Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) aren't the main characters, and they don't have that much screen time, but their dialogue still feels extremely forced and filled with a lot of nonsense. The ending of the story might not be as twisty as in other Shyamalan's installments, but I hope that people don't give up to false expectations. The classic Shyamalan's twisty ending isn't a necessary attribute of his movies, but the truth is that the twist is not the one you think it is. Once again, the note at the end of my review will clarify this.In the end, Split is Shyamalan's return to his old early 2000's self. Brilliantly unconventional storytelling, a lot of suspense, some very captivating subplots and a fantastic editing and production team behind him. The soundtrack plays a huge role in this film, as well as James McAvoy, who delivers his career-best performance. Anya Taylor-Joy is also pretty extraordinary, something that can't be said about her fellow friends who portrayed two bland characters. The ending brings the classic twist that makes everything more understandable, and I gotta say ... I love this film, and it is one of 2017's best!MAJOR SPOILER BELOWAs I said above, the soundtrack plays a huge role in the ending twist. That's because the soundtrack that plays right before the title of the movie appears on the screen, is the same one as in the third act of Unbreakable.This is one of the many clues throughout the film that hint at the idea that Split belongs to Unbreakable's universe. Naturally, after the title shows up, there's a scene with David Dunn (Bruce Willis) that confirms this theory, but these are little details that make Shyamalan into a great director and screenwriter. Also, it's a pity that I've only watched these movies after Shyamalan stating that they were part of an eventual trilogy. Not that I was not surprised at the end of Split, but it did remove that first impact of pure shock in knowing that two films separated by 17 years (in real life) are part of the same universe.Both movies end up falling into the ""superhero"" genre. Unbreakable is the story of our ""hero"" who spent his whole life sad because he wasn't doing ""what he was supposed to do"", and Split is an origin story of our ""villain"". If Glass delivers, this might be one of the best ""superhero"" trilogies ever.","

"Foolish","18 May 2018","After watching this movie, I have to say, I don't understand all the one and two star reviews. This is a return to form for the director of the excellent SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. I haven't enjoyed most of his output since those first two films, but only titles like his misguided LAST AIRBENDER and the truly terrible THE HAPPENING are deserving of such low marks. I've seen a few real one star movies, and SPLIT isn't one of them. It's definitely worthy of higher marks. I can only assume those who didn't like it are trying to lower the average rather than rank it realistically somewhere closer to 4 or 5 stars (although I'd rank it higher).It's a lot of fun. James MacAvoy is great in a subgenre that is normally pretty insipid (ie dissociative identity disorder movies). He deliveres a great performance that really helps to carry this film, and Betty Buckley also gives a notably outstanding performance in her supporting role.Is it as good as THE SIXTH SENSE? No. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. I'd happily see it again.As for those reviewers who are upset that movies like this distort the public perceptions about mental illness, I can only assume they are too close to that subject to be truly objective.","

"TheLittleSongbird","4 February 2017","As said in my recent review for 'The Visit', M Night Shyamalan is one inconsistent director, with films that have fallen on both extreme sides of the film spectrum. The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender', 'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.'Split' now replaces 'The Visit' as Shyamalan's best film since 'The Village. Neither were perfect films or were to me the returns to form often touted, both with many great things which made it more frustrating that they also had flaws big enough to stop them from living to full potential. Ranking 'Split' with the rest of the films, it's for me one of his better ones (while 'The Visit' is somewhere in the middle), not a patch on 'Unbreakable' and especially 'The Sixth Sense' but certainly better than all his previous films post-'The Village' (and that is saying volumes, due to that the least bad of his ""panned"" films 'Lady in the Water' was still poor).The best thing about 'Split' is the performance of James McAvoy, who has never been creepier on film and it is a side that is just startling to watch. He has a very difficult role here, with 20+ very contrasting personalities sometimes having to change without warning quite violently and absolutely nails it in a way that one wouldn't think would expect from him. Anya Taylor Joy is more than up to his level in an enigmatic turn that combines shock, spunk and pathos. As is Betty Buckley in a sympathetic role that she does a lot with.Production design, lighting and effects have a real eeriness that adds hugely to the atmosphere, while the cinematography is significantly better than it was in 'The Visit', having an audacious and atmospheric professionalism and not done with a technique that will alienate (and has alienated) many. The music is suitably eerie, and Shyamalan does direct more than competently in building on the scares and tension.Apart from an ever so slightly dull beginning, much of the film up to the last half an hour is genuinely scary and suspenseful, with many twisty suspenseful turns, a sense of fun, frightening chills and contortions enough to bend the mind, more than delivering on the horror and psychological thriller elements.However, the last half an hour does disappoint, with a revelation that while certainly not obvious (far from it, actually very much unexpected) is revealed prematurely still which does hurt the momentum and tension, horror and suspense is replaced by head-scratching confusion (in the execution that is because it did feel muddled and under-explained) and behaviours and decisions that will induce groans of frustration. Unfortunately that last personality was as far from realistic or properly scary as one could possibly get (not McAvoy's fault at all, actually he did give the needed creepiness, but what he was given which was goofy), coming over as pretty silly actually and that jarred.Writing could have been much better, with a better and less awkward flow, the dialogue could have been less clunky and forced as well as less sloppily melodramatic. The victims also were written very lazily, constantly making stupid and illogical decisions that makes one frustrated at them rather than rooting for them.On the whole, fairly split here. A lot of great merits but could have been better. Still one of Shyamalan's better films, just not enough to make me proclaim ""he's back!"" 6/10 Bethany Cox","

"zardoz-13","6 February 2017","If tour-de-force performances alone constituted great cinema, then ""Sixth Sense"" writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"" would rate as one of the best. Instead, Shyamalan's twelfth movie boils down to a straightforward, low-budget, abduction thriller, with a cannibalistic serial killer. The difference is this serial killer is a colorful basket case, a character teeming with more identities than you can count on all fingers and toes. As the traumatized casualty of an abusive mom, woebegone protagonist Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy of ""Victor Frankenstein"") has forged a 'horde' of personalities to serve as a bulwark against the atrocity of real-life. Predictable, derivative, and sometimes preposterous, ""Split"" benefits largely from McAvoy's nuanced performance as well as Shyamalan's usual last-minute surprises. ""Split"" feels like an 'origins' film. Not only is the protagonist a villain, but he also remains at large. The heroine is one of his hostages. Naturally, McAvoy has a field day chewing the scenery as a wacko with 23 personalities who is gestating number twenty-four. Basically, this charming but deranged ding-a-ling abducts three pretty little things from a Philadelphia shopping mall and confines them for his own culinary delight in an underground facility from which escape is virtually impossible. Compared with other movies about split-personality psychos, ""Split"" features a wackadoodle serial killer who isn't presented as a maniac out of a Rob Zombie splatter film. McAvoy's chameleon-like capacity to shift from one identity to another in the wink of an eye is as fluid as if he were genuinely conflicted himself. Suffice to say, McAvoy is nothing short of brilliant as Kevin Wendell Crumb. Were it not for one of the three captives, ""Split"" would have probably focused entirely on Kevin and not been as dramatic. Casey Cook is one of the kidnapped girls, but she is nothing like the other girls. Unfortunately, we see only eight of the twenty-three fruitcakes that McAvoy portrays, but none is either demonic or original. Meanwhile, two of those four other characters lack sympathy because they brought this tragedy on themselves by ridiculing this psycho. What ""Split"" does better than anything else is create a strong, memorable villain, and McAvoy fleshes it out in a bravura performance. Shyamalan conjures up a modicum of suspense toward the end when the girls try desperately to escape. Sometimes, this above-average suspense proves aggravating because you realize how futile it is for these doomed characters to survive.Like Kevin, Casey Cook (Anya Taylor-Joy of ""The Witch"") has been forged in the crucible of child abuse, too. A heart attack killed her father (Sebastian Arcelus of ""Ted 2"") while she was attending elementary school. Sadly, her father's brother, Uncle John (Brad William Henke of ""Fury""), became Casey's guardian. Without divulging too much information, Casey and her stepfather have had an abusive relationship. Now, in high school, Casey prefers to keep to herself. Two of her snobbish classmates, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson of ""The Edge of Seventeen"") and Claire's African-American friend Marcia (Jessica of ""Honeytrap""), invite her to their birthday party more out of pressure rather than friendship. Indeed, they harbor cynical attitudes about Casey, but they fear the social media repercussions about what they might have faced had they not invited Casey. When her ride doesn't materialize, Casey agrees to accompany Claire and Marcia and listen to Claire's father (Brian Gildea) who loves to tell terrible jokes. As the saying goes, Hell is a road paved with good intentions, and Claire and Marcia have provided the asphalt that puts Casey in harm's way. Before they can pull out of the parking lot, a total stranger, Kevin Wendell Crumb, dispenses with Claire's dad and then carjacks them. Slipping on a face mask, he sprays something in their eyes that plunges them into oblivion. Of course, had they not been paralyzed with fear, these girls could have fled before Kevin incapacitated them. When they awaken, the girls find themselves locked up in a room with the same tight-lipped stranger staring at them. Eventually, they discover something is seriously amiss with their captor. Every time Crumb appears, he masquerades as an entirely different individual, sometimes even as a woman. What the three girls don't realize is that Kevin is a patient of a world-renowned psychotherapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley of ""Frantic""), who has terribly misjudged the threat that he poses to society. Repeatedly, Kevin warns her about 'the beast' and how this Messianic personality will shield all twenty-three personalities from scorn and ridicule. When 'the beast' shows up, ""Split"" turns into a warped Marvel Comics movie because this side of Kevin possesses supernatural characteristics.Basically, ""Split"" is a standard-issue serial killer saga. Neither the police nor the FBI interfere in ""Split,"" which differentiates it from movies like ""Manhunter."" Shyamalan confines the action primarily to several underground rooms and one in a luxurious apartment. Shyamalan fashions some mildly suspenseful scenes, especially when the girls try to break out in the end. When the time comes for him to depict death, Shyamalan doesn't indulge himself as Eli Roth of ""Hostel"" infamy might. Nevertheless, the action amounts to a predictable series of episodic encounters between McAvoy's various personalities and his victims. Aside from Kevin Wendell Crumb, Casey qualifies as the only other genuinely interesting character. The two snobbish girls might as well have been mannequins. They are expendable, and they behave like whiny victims in a movie where whiny victims die. Most of Shyamalan's surprises occur exactly when you expect them, though two deserve back-to-back ""WOWS!"" because they come both as a relief and surprise! The outcome of Casey's hostile clash with 'the Beast' salvages this otherwise predictable potboiler. Bruce Willis's cameo in the final scene as security guard David Dunn brings ""Split"" into the ""Unbreakable"" timeline. Moreover, two characters at a diner compare Crumb to Glass! Ultimately, Shyamalan wants moviegoers to see James McAvoy's conflicted serial killer in ""Split"" in the same light as Alfred Hitchcock's classic chiller ""Psycho"" with Anthony Perkins as the protagonist.","

"Quinoa1984","27 January 2017","Split is a film that asks you to suspend your disbelief, and at first, even after the many films that this director has done where he goes way too far, I was with Split for about the first half of the way through, or maybe more. I knew logically this is not how DID works (Disassociative Identity Disorder), but hey, it's a movie, let's go with it. And to Shyamalan's credit, he casts the two major parts to the point where it's key and it works. And as a director, overall, and in large part thanks to the cinematographer behind It Follows, it's a film directed with real terror and suspense. It's low-budget, largely a 'bottle' film, and he uses his money with true style. It's paced well... where was I (now I feel like I got this disorder and will become two different critics here, gotta control...)Oh, yeah, James McAvoy, he's fantastic. He may not be playing 23 personalities in total, but the ones that Shyamalan focuses on are developed enough - among them is Barry (a gay fashion designer that McAvoy sort of plays like a young Pacino or something, in the physicality), Dennis (the one who may seem to be in 'control' and is extremely OCD about any dirt) and Hedwig (who is nine years old, and you can tell) - give McAvoy enough room to explore these personalities. There's times of awkward laughter at first, but this gives way to seeing that McAvoy is so committed to these characters, and is pulling them all of with intensity and charm and disbelief and a madness that is kind of similar to them all, that he's impossible to dislike.Another key player is Ana Taylor Joy, as she's the one of the three girls that we get to know the most (though with this we get into something of a, for me, forced motivation, but I'll get to that later), and she is on for all of these interactions with McAvoy. She's the one who can somehow speak to Hedwig sympathetically and connect with him, and when she is freaking out and trying to hold things inside, she does this perfectly. Between this and The VVitch she is really on a roll as a major actress for thrillers - she can play terrified, but being in control and being bad-ass works as well. And for a lot of the scenes the actress playing the psychiatrist, Betty Buckley, is believable, as far as she can take the lines to...Okay, here's where we get into the DID here with this movie in reality, it's with its writer AND then also its director. I don't mean the same person, I mean they are separate entities. Shyamalan the director is on top of his game here, with a formal rigor that hasn't clicked this week in well over a decade (it may even connect to Unbreakable, which... oh, more on that at the end of this). Shyamalan the *writer* is something else. He's still someone who thinks he's oh, so, so clever, and you know what? For that first half or so, he kind of is. At least, again, when it comes to the suspension-of-disbelief factor. He does a more than competent job of giving us a believable enough set-up with these girls being held captive, Barry putting up his false front when emailing but then denying anything is wrong to the doctor, and then how the personalities have their splits with the girls and how they are trying (unsuccessfully to escape)... but then Shyamalan the writer gets greedy. Or insane. Or both.The biggest problem here is that this man is CHEATING by the end of this, and in a way that is baffling. He can't have enough with having this somewhat preposterous thriller about a man juggling all these personalities that may lead up to ""The Beast"", the 24th personality. No, it needs to be deeper than that. It also needs to involve child molestation - not just with this man, but the Ana Taylor Joy character when she was younger - and that this, uh, maybe leads into having these super DID powers(!?) He's creating a whacked-out mythology where one needn't exist, and by the time the third act takes off, and you can mark it as soon as the Buckley character comes to Barry/Dennis/Hedwig/Patricia/Et-Al's basement dwelling, it fully goes into bananas territory.I know, I know, it's a thriller, I know I should keep buying into what this is selling... but I just couldn't. Most of all (oh, hell, you got this far in this review) it's the gall to turn this around to make this as part of a, uh, Shyamalan Cinematic Universe with a Bruce Willis Unbreakable cameo that brings me into the 'you're cheating!' territory. Perhaps this is simply this man's M.O. as far as crafting his material, that he can see ahead and know that this is what he has to do, and that everything ties together... or he wrote himself into a corner, realized he was writing sheer insanity as far as where McAvoy goes in this final third, and had to cover up. Either way, it might work for you... or it may feel like him f***ing with all of us. At any rate, all of the material with The Beast has the sensation of Shyamalan as mad mainstream provocateur, like 'hey, how far can I actually take this stuff, you've come this far right, eh, right? RIGHT?!' To his credit, this is a more enjoyable piece of madness than The Village, and its final third makes it something I want to revisit simply to show friends in a 'Look upon this wonder in awe' way like The Happening. I think among the Shyamalan *bad* movies, and this is bad make no mistake, it's directed like a pro and the actors are all on their game, and becomes the best of them.","

"freshclean-66-318608","6 July 2017","When this film made it's first debut I was hesitant on seeing it because I thought M. Night Shyamalan had lost his touch a bit but right when I thought everything was over for M. Night being one of my favorite directors/producers I just up and decided to give him one more chance with ""Split"" and I'm so glad I did. This was classic M. Night all the way from the twists and the unpredictable story-line to the scares and the edge of your seat thrills. This is just a great horror/thriller played out as a far fetched psychological thriller. It's well written and the plot is laid out perfectly to the end and If you like older M. Night films you will definitely enjoy this one.","

"kosmasp","22 June 2017","Splitting hairs is nothing compared to this. Of course Split refers to our main character. Although M. Night has had some diverse reactions on his last outputs. But mostly people did like this and it almost seems like he made a comeback. If you thought he vanished that is of course. The script is tight and the movie has a lot of memorable moments (most of them being weird), although one of the biggest can be seen in the trailer, which is unfortunate.There's also another scene where M.Night can be seen. His Hitchcock moment as some call it (I think he himself too). Letthis argument not spoil the fun you may be having with this one. The overall acting is good (apart from the one cameo I just mentioned, which is cringe-worthy) and the tension is there until the end. And after it, because there is a stinger in the credits ... a nice one at that too!","

But it wasn't until we started to watch it that I knew Shyamalan directed this one!Shyamalan is back! With this movie, he proves he managed to prove us he rediscovered his mojo that he had when we were introduced to 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable' and... Hack: I even loved 'Signs'!His movies from 'The Village' and on were very disappointing. But 'Split' is good old fashion M.-work.James McAvoy does an amazing job and shows us that not only Edward Norton can play these kind of degenerated characters. Ans the ending with Bruce Willis...

"parry_na","2 February 2017","Two smartphone distracted girls and their 'weird' friend are kidnapped by an unknown assailant who carries out the action without any emotion whatsoever.'Barry' is a model employee. He's been ill, but is better now. Doctor Fletcher (Betty Buckley) says this. We learn of 'Barry's' disorder because Fletcher is trying to widen awareness for his condition. The information about what is known as 'DID' is staggered throughout, at length, and her scenes are interspersed with 'Barry' and his other personalities presenting themselves to his three prisoners. One of these is an upper-class woman called 'Patricia', another is an irritant called 'Hedwig', another is a nuisance called 'Dennis' (who likes to watch girls dance naked). In reality, his name is Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), and he has 23 personalities.Despite claims that, for example, if one personality is a weight-lifter he possesses the strength of a weight-lifter whilst other shared personalities do not, McAvey doesn't have the physical presence to portray anyone that couldn't just be over-powered by the three girls – or even just one of them (with a more sustained battering than just hitting him once and then turning their back on him, something that happens more than once). Despite the theatrical rolling eyes, the lisp, the change of clothes, he simply isn't frightening. His endless talking about himself makes it clear that his characters are a lot more interesting to him than to the audience – or at least, this member of it. I can appreciate a committed performance, but sadly he leaves me cold.Perhaps to balance out Kevin's multiple characteristics, the three girls have only one personality between them. Being the allegedly 'weird' one of the trio, it is Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who had been so good in 2015's 'The Witch') to whom 'Dennis' is attracted, because of course weirdness is an elite exclusive club that joins every outsider together, provided you're pretty enough ('the broken are the more evolved,' apparently). Luckily for flesh fans, one of Kevin's personalities suffers from OCD, necessitating the young captives to remove much of their 'dirty' clothing. Another box ticked.There have been accusations that 'Split' is offensive to sufferers of mental health disorders. In an age where being offended is a competitive sport, presumably any piece of fiction involving death, for instance, is offensive to anyone who has ever suffered bereavement and therefore 'shouldn't be allowed'. This is a point of view that stifles creativity, fiction, drama and/or many levels of art. That is not the problem with 'Split' in my view. It is an idea that is ripe with potential but simply stretched out very thinly over almost two hours with very little incident. In fact, the kidnapping of three girls is the only incident. Endless scenes of talking about 'Barry's' condition isn't entertaining, frightening or effecting. It very quickly becomes dull and stays that way.Director M. Night Shyamalan had a great success with 'The Sixth Sense' in 1999, especially its twist ending. Subsequently, all his films have ended with a similar surprise, each one less effective than the last. If you make it to the end of this, there is a revelation that (SPOILERS) Kevin's affliction appears to be supernatural. 'The Beast' is physically bulkier than his other personalities, can hop from wall to wall and is impervious to bullets. This ends with a reference to Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' via a Bruce Willis cameo which pre-supposes you are on familiar terms with that film, which is presumptuous, as this is not billed as a sequel.","

"trublu215","12 January 2017","M. Night Shyamalan's Split pits a ground of teenage girls against their captor (James McAvoy) and his plethora of multiple personalities with each personality ranging from harmless to deadly. First off, I want to say, I did enjoy the first hour or so of this film. It was creepy, tense, tasteless but fun. Then the final hour comes steam rolling everything in its wake including all the thought and caring that we've grown to have over the course of the previous hour. It is not one thing or another, it's a willingness to halt the film's growth as it's own and by the final minute of the film, everyone will know what I am talking about. As for spoilers, I'm not going to spoiling anything which makes my thoughts that much harder to gather. While I'm not a complete film snob, I do expect certain things going into an M. Night Shyamalan film. If you were talking to me before The Village, I'd say that I would expect a creepy atmospheric film. If you're asking me post-Village, I'd simply say ""Dear God, I hope it's good."" The Visit was somewhat back on track for him so I was excited to see this but instead I'm leaving this film actually giving up hope. The twist is so lazy and so out-of-left- field that it diminishes any sort of weight. It is merely a gimmick rather than a clever little twist, especially for a Shyamalan film. Honestly, it single handily ruined the film for me. It is a singular moment that completely drains Split of any real merit as a standalone film.Like I said, James McAvoy gives a chilling performance that sometimes goes over-the-top but still maintains a level of creepiness without it ever being overbearing. Anya Taylor-Joy gives a very good performance as well as Casey, who gives a better performance here than in last year's terrifying yet overrated The Witch. The rest of the cast plays out the typical female horror characters to a fault and actually fails to breathe new life in a very tiring role.Overall, Split is a film that could have cut out it's so-called ""twist"" and been a fun midnight movie, a solid 7/10. But instead M. Night Shyamalan delivers his laziest twist to date in hopes of continuing the trend that is a M. Night Shyamalan film. A term that used to mean something, now is played out to a gimmicky effect and we all know Shyamalan is so much better than that. And while I'm sure the ""twist"" will wet some hardcore fans' appetite, it made the film that much more trivialized.","

"moviewizguy","18 January 2017","1. Obviously, the first thing that should be mentioned is James McAvoy's amazing performance. He is genuinely good and convincing as he weaves in and out of vastly different personalities, sometimes in the same scene.2. Anya Taylor-Joy is a joy to watch as well. Her character has quite a bit of depth than the trailer suggests.3. Rejoice for Betty Buckley! Those who thought she was awful in THE HAPPENING will find her lovely in this film.4. As for the other two girls in the film - Haley Lu Richardson (who was wonderful in THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN) and Jessica Sula - are serviceable but not entirely memorable.5. Special shoutout to Izzie Coffey. Shyamalan always has a knack for finding talented young actors.6. My favorite personality? Hedwig. He is a delight every time he's on screen. Etcetera.7. Barry comes a close second. Seeing McAvoy play a homosexual character is as wonderful as it sounds.8. I would have liked to see more of Kevin himself.9. And in that line of thought, I would have liked to see more of the other personalities as well.10. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Not a surprise since Mike Gioulakis shot IT FOLLOWS.11. So is the score. This is Shyamalan's first parting from his go-to collaborator, James Newton Howard (unless you count Paul Cantelon's small contribution in THE VISIT). While a shame, West Dylan Thordson more than makes up for Newton Howard's absence, providing an atmospheric and surprisingly empathetic score in certain scenes.12. Most inventive opening/closing credits ever? I think so.**13. Don't let anyone spoil this movie for you. Just don't.**14. I've already seen the film twice within 5 days of each other. I liked it more the second time.15. But I still prefer THE VISIT. Some reasons:16. The climax is really underwhelming. It works thematically/symbolically, but the payoff falls short.17. On top of that, the third act itself could have been crazier.18. The structure gets repetitive.19. The runtime is a bit long as well.20. As a matter of fact, the film has many problems.21. But there are risks taken here, and SPLIT is admirable for that.22. In fact, the film goes to some truly dark territory, especially for its PG-13 rating.23. Overall thoughts? SPLIT is a really good January movie.24. But I don't doubt that audiences will be split on the film.","

Like it was somehow incomplete and without the missing elements there just didn't seem to be any point to its existence?

"kluseba","3 February 2017","Just like ""The Visit"" a year earlier, Shyamalan's new movie ""Split"" offers a great mixture of psychological suspense, horror elements and an emotional drama with a lot of depth. The great story line, the tense atmosphere and the stunning acting pardon for the lack of a real twist as we usually get from Shyamalan.The story is quickly told. A man diagnosed with twenty-three different personalities kidnaps three teenage girls and keeps them in an abandoned basement. The girls quickly realize that they can manipulate some of the split personalities while others are very hostile to them. It becomes obvious that the twenty-three personalities prepare for the emergence of a twenty-fourth personality called the beast that plans to feast on the teenagers' impure bodies. The three girls must find a strategy to escape before their lives will be in danger. At the same time, the psychologist of the man with the numerous personalities realizes that something seems to be wrong with her patient during their therapy sessions. Will the girls manage to escape and the psychologist find out the truth before it's too late?The movie develops a quite diversified pace right from the start. The teenagers get kidnapped within the first five minutes of the movie and have to face one of the more aggressive personalities right from the start. The movie then slows down and presents us seven of the twenty-three different personalities. The film also gives us background information thanks to therapy sessions with the perpetrator and his psychologist as well as flashbacks of one of the girls that will become more and more important throughout the movie. The last quarter of the film quickens up the pace and leads to a furious showdown and an interesting reference. If compared to Shyamalan's last movie, some questions are though left unanswered and indicate a potential sequel to this movie. The restricted space in the basement, the calm and precise camera work, the gloomy light effects and the sinister soundtrack progressively increase the uneasy atmosphere of the movie.James McAvoy has the challenging task to portray eight different personalities all at once and his acting performance alone elevates this movie to a very high level. He is credible in all of his roles and convinces as unpredictable patient that is both perpetrator and victim at the same time. This unprecedented acting performance should be honoured with a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role next year. The main actress incarnated by the talented Anya Taylor-Joy is almost as perfect as her character develops a fascinating chemistry with the perpetrator. Initially, she seems to be a shy outcast but turns out to be a clever and empathic young moment who will fight relentlessly for her survival. She's the tragic heroine of this movie and empathic viewers will definitely care about her fate. She would also deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role next year. Among the secondary characters, Betty Buckley convinces in her role as open-minded psychologist who is walking a thin line between tolerance and insistence to uncover her patient's gloomy secret. I think she would deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress next year. Overall, the cast is really convincing and easily the best in the psychological horror genre since Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"".The only reason why this movie didn't get all ten points are a few minor lengths in the story telling during the first half of the film and the fact that the movie didn't come around with a stunning twist in the key of many of Shyamalan's previous works. Still, ""Split"" is an extraordinary psychological thriller with an intense plot, an uneasy atmosphere and absolutely outstanding acting. Genre fans might even have their best movie of the year right here. Even those who like to criticize Shyamalan should admit that ""Split"" is a success and one of the best movies in his career. This film should definitely be rewarded with awards and is one of the few Hollywood movies that actually deserves all the attention it gets.","

"brankovranjkovic","22 January 2017","This disappointing film stars James McAvoy, who I must admit is excellent in 23 contrasting roles, he has a personality disorder and these are the main characters that live in him. He kidnaps 3 girls and holds them hostage in a strange and strong underground maintenance area. He intends to feed the girls to the ""The Beast"", his 24th personality. His characters regularly visit a psychologist and depending on who is speaking they are said to be 'taking the light'.The plot is total nonsense, if you want to see young girls in their underwear with jiggly boobs then this film is definitely for you.I can't believe James McAvoy decided to get involved with this rubbish.

James McAvoy is too talented for this silly movie, which had a big potential in terms of plot, but it was reduced to the regular Shyamalan garbage. It starts well, but gets worse and worse until it reaches the awful silly ending.BTW, although Anya Taylor-Joy is a main character, I think she has less lines of dialog than Arnie in the first TERMINATOR.As always, Shyamalan has to give himself a silly cameo.

"moonspinner55","27 January 2017","A return to the tried and true: M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"", which he wrote and directed (both rather clinically), opens with a distinct ""Silence of the Lambs"" vibe before eventually evolving into a continuation of themes Shyamalan used for his ""Unbreakable"". Three teenage girls in Philadelphia are abducted from a parking lot by a man with dissociative identity disorder; he harbors dozens of personalities--male, female and child--but the final one to present itself is calling for an alliance of ""the horde"", and may represent something superhuman. While the opening scenes do have a familiar ring, they are well-executed by the filmmaker, who gives the audience what its probably hoping for; but Shyamalan, to his credit (although some genre buffs might not be so generous), is aiming for something loftier than imprisoned girls attempting to escape from a psychotic. The film offers a dissertation on DID via the captor's somewhat-unwitting psychiatrist, who--via Skype!--gives a clinical rundown of the mental disorder to her colleagues (including case studies). None of this information, however interesting, is utilized in the final stretch, as Shyamalan is out to baffle us with a plot-twist that is both confounding and amusing. While ""Split"" is creepy on occasion, it isn't effective as a scary thriller. Maybe Shyamalan feels he's above giving his audience a shock, a jolt, but sometimes a few good clichés are better than a round-table discussion. ** from ****","

"catalinapoliczer","25 July 2018","M.Night Shyamalan is one of those filmmakers that you either love or hate, and I definitely love his work. However, I stopped watching him after the Happening, (which was really quite a terrible movie. No comment on The Last Airbender). This is such a wonderful comeback. His ability to totally freak you out without being terrifying; to keep you fascinated, yet completely confused, it's all just so much fun! Not sure how his films can be so slow yet so gripping and FUN! This one is bang on. The cinematography is wonderful, the story is intense and gripping. Not to mention that James Macavoy is bang on (what a great performance, love Joaquin Phoenix, but not sure he would have been quite so awesomely intense as Macavoy was). I highly recommend this film to any thriller lovers and a must for any M.Night lovers (but I don't need to say that at this point now, do I). I agree it's not a horror film but it does very get under your skin. (If you found The Ring too much, don't watch this!) However, if you loved The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, this is a must see!! Can't wait to see Glass.","

"phd_travel","6 July 2017","What a disappointment this movie was. From good reviews I expected something like the best movie of M Night since the Sixth Sense. It turned out to be one of his worst. I give up on him. Everything since the Sixth Sense has been a let down.The story is awful - not clever just irritating and unpleasant. 3 teenagers get kidnapped by a man with split personalities. Of course you want to see what happens if the girls live or die but it wasn't scary just boring and predictable.It's good Betty Buckley had a big role as the psychiatrist. She is so talented she deserves a resurrection in her film career. Unfortunately the character she plays is rather dumb. James MacAvoy tries hard with the material - A for effort. But he is not Sally Field in Sybil.Unequivocally this movie is no good.","

"Sober-Friend","25 April 2017","M. Night Shyamalan hit the big time with ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999. His follow up films have been not just been huge disappoints but truly some of the worse films I had to sit through. ""Unbreakable"" was just stupid and so was ""Signs"" and ""The Village"". I did not even bother to watch ""The Lady in the Water"" and other celluloid manure he created. So last night against my better judgment I saw ""Split"" which was just an exercise in patience. M. Night Shyamalan proves he likes to not only bore his audience but he also loves steel money from studios that still will back his films.In this film M. Night Shyamalan had an interesting gem of an idea about a crazy man who kidnaps 3 girls. The Three teenagers, Claire, Marcia, and outsider Casey, are kidnapped and held captive by ""Dennis"", one of 23 personalities present in the mind of Kevin Wendell Crumb, a victim of childhood abuse diagnosed with identity disorder. The film however fails to engage the audience. A few scenes work but they are out numbered by the scenes that don't. The film of course has a ""Minor"" twist at the end but its more like a winks to the audience for fans of one of the directors other films. A much better film that dealt with split personalities is ""Raising Cain"" and ""Sisters"". It least those films were done by craftsmen that knew how to engage an audience. He still has lots of fan who will hate this review. That's too bad that they will thumbs down this review when in fact they know this film is awful. They need to get a life","

"claudio_carvalho","24 March 2017","After a birthday party in a mall, the teenager Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), Claire Benoit (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) are abducted by a man (James McAvoy). Soon they learn that the man has DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) with several personalities. His psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) is aware of his personalities but does not suspect that he is the kidnapper of the three girls. Casey, who has been abused by her Uncle John (Brad William Henke) since she was a kid, tries to manipulate the weakest personalities to escape. But the problem is that the strong personality The Beast is quite unleashed and is coming. ""Split"" is another annoying and silly film by the mediocre and overrated M. Night Shyamalan. This director / writer made success with the rip-off of ""Haunted"" (1995) and now uses the concept of the masterpiece ""Identity"" (2003) to make ""Split"". James McAvoy's character is not scary but laughable and ridiculous. The psychologist is absolutely incompetent and only Casey Cooke is a promising character wasted by the terrible screenplay. The conclusion is maybe the worst part of this forgettable film. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Fragmentado"" (""Shattered"")","

"dave-mcclain","20 January 2017","Dissociative Identity Disorder (known as DID, and previously called Multiple Personality Disorder) is a psychological disorder in which a single person displays multiple distinct personalities, often as a defense mechanism to help the original personality deal with some sort of emotional trauma, like that suffered as a result of child abuse. These personalities each have a distinct name and distinct personality traits. As you can imagine, this condition is shrouded in mystery, is especially difficult to diagnose and treat and can be very dangerous for the sufferer – and for those around him/her/them. Fascination with DID has been fodder for a number of movies over the years, most notably in 1976 when Sally Field played (and won an Emmy for) a made-for-TV version of the true story of a woman who had 16 different personalities. (""Sybil"" was remade, again for TV, in 2007, then starring Tammy Blanchard and Jessica Lange.) 2017 offers a fictional DID story in the form of the horror-thriller ""Split"" (PG-13, 1:57), written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan who also co-produces for the second time with Jason Blum and Marc Bienstock of Blumhouse Productions, which gave us horror franchises like ""Paranormal Activity"".James McAvoy is Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man with 23 different personalities inside his head, but who is still able to function in society. He lives on his own, has held a good job for ten years, and regularly sees his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). She finds it difficult to treat Kevin, but she cares a great deal about his mental health and she makes herself available to him 24/7. She also finds it difficult to gain professional acceptance for the things she is learning about DID by working with Kevin. And it can be especially difficult for Dr. Fletcher to know which of Kevin's personalities with whom she is speaking. For a while now, she's been dealing primarily with Kevin's artistic personality, known as Barry, but something has changed in her recent sessions with Kevin. She senses it, but isn't sure what it means.However, three young women are experiencing firsthand what has changed in Kevin. High school friends Claire and Marcia (Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula) are giving a ride to strange loner Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) when Kevin suddenly gets into their car, incapacitates the three of them and takes them to some sort of underground facility in which he lives and has built a room to hold the girls. Actually, it was Dennis, Kevin's most forceful personality, who abducted the three, but they don't understand what is going on, why they've been taken or what they should do about it. Disagreements over how to work together to escape and the emergence of Dennis' fellow ""alters"" keep them off balance, but when they do take action, their attempts to resist just make matters worse for them. With the obvious exception of their captive state, the girls are unharmed, but it becomes clear that something bad is about to happen.""Split"" is an outstanding return to form for Shyamalan and one of the best horror-thrillers in years. Looking at audience and critics' ratings reveals that there was a slow, but steady decline in the popularity of his films after he burst into the public consciousness with his Best Picture Oscar-nominated 1999 drama-mystery-thriller ""The Sixth Sense"". That decline bottomed out with 2010's ""The Last Airbender"", but rebounded slightly with 2013's ""After Earth"". The reception for his films improved further with his 2015 horror-thriller ""The Visit"", his first film with Blumhouse Productions, who gave Shyamalan more artistic freedom than he had enjoyed in many years. Although ""Split"" doesn't feature one of his trademark mind-bending twists, it's his best film in 10-15 years.Here, he has made a movie with an original concept, a compelling narrative and genuine tension which gradually builds. It helps that this is an especially well-acted horror film. McAvoy transforms himself (physically, emotionally and regarding audience perceptions of him), Buckley turns in her most powerful performance since the original ""Carrie"" in 1976 and Taylor-Joy follows up her under-appreciated work in 2016's ""The Witch"" and ""Morgan"" showing that she's one of the most talented young actresses of the mid-late 2010s. And, almost as much as this film showing that Shyamalan is very much back as a director, his fans will appreciate seeing two actors from his earlier films in the cast and one killer reference to one of those films in the closing credits. ""Split"" is not to be missed. ""A""","

"bob the moo","22 September 2019","It was the recent release of Glass that made me decide to watch this film, despite its so-so reviews; I wanted to watch the former, and it didn't feel right to skip right to it. The film opens with a creepy setup, and gradually plays out the multiple personalities of the main characters, while at the same time increasing the tension through the peril of the young women trapped somewhere. In terms of stakes and tension, it mostly does it well, with an escalation as the film goes, but the film is not tight enough to be event driven, and at two hours there is lots of material which seemed intended to do something, but mostly doesn't deliver.It is an odd film in this way, because there is a lot here to work with, but too much of it is superficial. It plays very much like a first or second draft; so for example there are elements so undercooked that it feels like the type of material that would have been taken out later down the road to try to make more space for other elements, or just recognizing that it adds time but not value. Casey's flashbacks add almost nothing - not because they are a bad idea, but because they are not worked through enough; the film would have lost almost nothing by removing them. Likewise, the battle within the main character doesn't have a sense of struggle really; it could have been much more, and thus the conclusion could have been more impacting, but it doesn't have much in the way of weight or emotion behind it. Again, there was much more writing and refining to be done here.It is a shame, because the cast deserve more than they have to work with. McAvoy is great as he slips between characters totally convincingly; he throws himself into this and almost singlehandedly makes the film worth seeing. Taylor-Joy is almost as good because of how she plays her fear; while the film doesn't help the viewer connect to her 5-year old self, the actresses seems to have found it, and there is more in her performance than the film lets us see. Probably the blame should be laid at the feet of Shyamalan; he wrote and directed this, and it is very his type of weakness - he wants the concept and idea to be the thing, but the depth etc he is not often able to find. The film running long and having too much in it is probably down to him too - editor Ciarrocchi seems to have his career thanks to Shyamalan, so he is unlikely to be tough in the edit.Split squanders a lot - a couple of very good performances, and a generally interesting concept and through-line mostly. It lays out its plot in semi-cooked chunks and then serves them up like an early draft - some of it needed chucking, and the rest needed improving; but it doesn't do either.","

"trans_mauro","26 March 2017","I've said that many times that anything, any film that is presented as a ""convoluted"", ""complicated"", ""complex"" story or plot will make the majority of audiences and critics to laud it as something good.""Split"" is another example of this type of behavior/reasoning.But in reality the whole thing is idiotic, the story has plot holes the size of Texas (e.g. the three girls could easily subdue the child personality), the child molestation subplot is totally unnecessary, the whole DID gets old very fast, and the twist (yes, there is a twist, since this is is a Shyamalan film) only works for those who watched another film released in 2000!Waste of time and waste of money...","

"Coventry","10 January 2020","I completely gave up on M. Night Shyamalan between 2005 and 2015. Talking in film titles, that means between ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Visit"". I always thought his supposedly greatest accomplishments ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were vastly overrated (and even blatant rip-offs of obscure horror gems), but at least they were watchable. I severely disliked ""Signs"" and absolutely hated ""The Village"", so after that it was exit M. Night for me. From what I read on the internet, he only made rubbish and commercial flops in this 10-year-period anyway. ""Split"" seemed different. It has a more intriguing concept than all of Shyamalan's previous movies combined, and for the very first time, the plot genuinely appeals to fans of dark psycho-thrillers. Usually his stories are balancing on the verge of fantasy and melodrama, with a minor touch of morbidity.The first half of ""Split"" is really good! The script luckily doesn't waste too much time and almost immediately begins with the powerful and intense kidnapping sequence of three teenage girls - in broad daylight on a busy parking lot - by a sinister young man with an evil grimace on his face. The girls, two typically shallow beauties and one introvert girl with a troubled past, are taken to an unknown location and locked up in a sort of basement. What follows next are a good 40-45 minutes of terrific cinema during which the three girls, simultaneously with the audience, gradually learn that their kidnapper isn't just an ordinary maniac but a deeply disturbed schizophrenic with no less than 23 different personalities. The quiet girl, Casey, realizes their only chance for escape is by manipulating the weaker personalities, but there's also a 24th and ultimately evil alter ego brooding within Kevin.Lots of praise and respect for talented young actress Anya Taylor-Joy, and especially for James McAvoy as Barry, Kevin, Dennis, Hedwig, Patricia, etc. Okay, admittedly, it must be a dream come true for any actor to be offered the chance to play a character like this and demonstrate that you are capable of depicting a variety of roles, but still McAvoy puts a lot of passion and devotion in every single twisted personality! My personal favorite is definitely the posh, elderly lady with the dress and necklace. Best male-actor-playing-ugly-old-woman since Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", for sure! Sadly, M. Night's true personality also comes to the surface, and not even McAvoy can prevent ""Split"" from slowly turning into a dull and overly talkative B-thriller. Notably the conversations between whatever personality and his therapist are tedious and seem to last endlessly, but also Casey's cliched background story is quite redundant. Not sure what rating ""Split"" received, but the violence and murders all occur off screen, and that is a damn shame! I didn't like the ending (come to think of it, I never like the endings in Shyamalan's movies) but apparently it's the bridge towards a sequel/origin story ""Glass"".","

I completely understand the topic of the movie is too fantastic and unbelievable but that's what it is, it doesn't have to be believable. Once you forget about that and just go with the flow it's actually very entertaining.It has a deeper meaning and it gets dramatic at times but that gives it depth and takes you away from the supernatural of the script. Will take you to a trip analyzing human nature and the roots and causes of people becoming evil.You will have a great time watching this, very fast paced as well.","

Personally, I thought the acting was incredible and I loved the character development. What I didn't like was the portrayal of multiple personality disorder. It went from a very interesting story to a mediocre silly ending where he turns into a monster and starts killing people and starts doing supernatural things. That ruined it for me personally. M Night shyamlans direction was horrible towards the end. So far his best film will only be the sixth sense.","

They are held captive by a man with 23 personalities (James McAvoy) of which we see about a half dozen or so. They attempt to confuse and match wits with him. This scene is interrupted by the man's therapy with his psychologist (Betty Buckley) who sees him as something special. Dennis is the personality who has the girls captive. He is supposed to be a banned personality because he is bad for liking to watch young girls dance naked...plot spoiler...it never happens. Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) is different from the other two girls captured. She is not part of the clique. We see her childhood through flashbacks, setting her up for the ""final girl."" The film is NOT a tie the girls up rip their blouse off type of adventure...although there are some token bra and pantie shots.

"ferbs54","5 June 2018","Over the years, there have been any number of films that have dealt with lead characters who suffer with what the layman might term ""split personality."" Putting aside all the many iterations of the Jekyll & Hyde story, in 1957, audiences were given both ""Lizzie,"" in which Eleanor Parker played a woman with three distinct personalities, and, five months later, the more well-known ""The Three Faces of Eve,"" in which Joanne Woodward played a woman with the exact same predicament. In 1960, theatergoers were shocked out of their showers via their introduction to Tony Perkins' Norman Bates, a young man who was also his own mother, in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" The situation was played for laughs in 1963's ""The Nutty Professor,"" with Jerry Lewis portraying the hapless Prof. Julius Kelp AND his alter ego, the Dean Martin-like Buddy Love. But you would have to take all the preceding alter egos, and perhaps toss in later films such as 1992's ""Raising Cain"" (in which John Lithgow sported three personalities) and 2007's ""Sybil"" (in which the titular character, played by Tammy Blanchard, possessed no fewer than 16!), to exceed the number of disparate types to be found living inside one person, in M. Night Shyamalan's most recent offering, 2017's ""Split.""  The film introduces us to a most unusual character...or should I say, ""horde"" of characters (no wonder the news media later refers to this personage as ""The Horde""!). He is Kevin Wendell Crumb--brought to remarkable life by the Scottish actor James McAvoy--a Philadelphia native (as have been so many of the director/writer's previous lead characters) who suffers with the condition known as DID: dissociative identity disorder. As a matter of fact, his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), has identified no fewer than 23 (!) personalities residing inside his noggin, each waiting patiently in his or her ""chair"" for a chance to step forward ""into the light."" (And if this setup strikes some as being a bit improbable, I might add here that the real-life Eve evinced a full 22 personalities, and required a good 17 years of psychotherapy as a consequence!) Somehow, Crumb has managed to live a fairly low-key life in modern society, even managing to hold down a job as a dress designer, thanks to the talents of one of his many personae, Barry. But following a prank of a sexual nature perpetrated on him by a group of randy schoolgirls, Kevin snaps, and is soon seen kidnapping three young women in the parking lot of the King of Prussia Mall. Those three women--Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy)--are incarcerated in some kind of underground bunker, while their captor intimidates them as successive personalities of his step into the light. Thus, we get to see McAvoy essay a good half dozen of Kevin's 23 inner personae; for example, the 9-year-old Hedwig, the dressy Patricia, and the unflappably in-command Dennis. But Dr. Buckley grows increasingly concerned with her patient, when Dennis/Barry informs her that a 24th personality, which he terms ""The Beast,"" is soon to emerge. And since the good doctor knows that each of Kevin's personalities can effectively transform his body chemistry as it enters the light, there is every reason for concern...especially since this Beast is said to be extremely large, very fast, very powerful, able to climb walls (!) and, as it turns out, somewhat cannibalistic as regards dietary requirements.... ""Split"" was produced on a budget of a mere $9 million and proved to be a box office smash, bringing in around $280 million all told. And there was very good reason for this. The film is a remarkably suspenseful affair, and every attempt that our trio of young prisoners makes to escape from their cell is a nerve-racking one. The three young actresses on display here are all terrific, especially Taylor-Joy. Her Casey character is both beautiful and interesting, and the director shows us her history in flashbacks that allow us to see why she is so well suited to survive in this horrendous situation (her father had trained her in outdoor shooting and survival skills), and why she is the introverted young lady that she is today (a bit of sexual molestation on the part of a skeevy uncle would do that for anyone!). The film makes good use of its autumnal scenery--Philly and its surroundings have never looked more gorgeous--and Shyamalan's script is a clever one. But best of all is McAvoy, whose sextuple performance is practically Oscar worthy. Not since Alex Guinness in 1949's ""Kind Hearts and Coronets,"" in which the beloved British actor essayed no fewer than nine distinct roles, and perhaps Peter Sellers in 1964's ""Dr. Strangelove,"" in which the actor gave the world three entirely different and truly memorable characters, has a performer attempted such a feat, AND brought it off as successfully. And for those who are wondering if Shyamalan once again pulls the rug out from beneath his audience's expectations with one of his patented surprise endings, the answer is a decided ""yes""; an ending that sets the viewer up for a sequel that also ties into another of the director's previous films. I don't think I'm giving anything away here at this late date by saying that this sequel is to be entitled ""Glass,"" and that it will be coming out in January 2019. Personally, it is a film for which I cannot wait....","

"Theo Robertson","29 January 2017","There's two ways to develop this ""psycho character kidnaps a trio of teenage girls"" type of plot . One is to make the girls and the audience squirm as they're subjected to all type of obscene practises in a torture porn type of tale . The other is to keep the horrors mainly psychological and understated and hope the actor playing the psycho isn't going to have too much fun in the role The good news is that SPLIT isn't torture porn . Even better news is while James McAvoy has fun in the role it's never enough to actually take you out of the movie . McAvoy is of course a Scottish actor from a working class background and it's usually a distraction watching ""one of us"" in a commercial Hollywood movie but here McAvoy delivers a pivotal role playing a character suffering from dissociative identity disorder . Okay it's obvious no one had an eye on the Oscars when this was released and McAvoy's character pieces are a bit episodic along with being intermittently camp but even so the film rests mainly on this performance !!!! TAKE NO CHANCES SUGGESTIVE SPOILER !!!!! M Night Shyamalan is a director whose string of flops over the last few years have made the average audience member totally forget that he was once being touted as the new Spielberg and the temptation to do a sequel to one of his earlier regarded works must have been huge . Instead he concentrates on the understated psychological horrors of the predator and his prey in a slightly above average thriller . That said there is a twist involving self reference right at the very end which makes this above average thriller even more slightly above average","

"imdb-45","31 March 2017","So the first reviews here were which rated the film are obviously those connected with the film. The torrent of bad reviews that follows are the honest ones. From the start I had a bad feeling about this movie because the intro was so awkward and the dialogue was so cheesy with poor acting.James Macavoy is a very talented and versatile actor. How he was suckered into doing the latest Shyalaman stinker can only be explained by his needing to pay back a favor or someone having a terrible video of James with a farm animal. This film is that bad. The only moments that are somewhat tolerable are when Macavoy is on the screen. He's got by far the most presence and talent and the rest of the cast looks even worse contrasting his performance with theirs.In short, Macavoy plays a mentally ill person with multiple personalities. He kidnaps 2 girls with the assistance of a third who is terrified to act against his wishes, even when she has the ability to just walk away in a public airport. I mentioned this because that is how the film opens. You must buy into the premise in order for the film to even start to work.As the film progresses, it becomes evident early on that Macavoy suffers from this multiple personality disorder and will act out each part. And Shyalaman throws in his usual bit of supernatural rubbish, how such afflictions are also gifts, the savant mentality. OK, great, got it. Begin an hour of torture porn and hints of what bad things might happen. Warning that things will get worse. Heighten tension. Disclose things that don't really add up. Heighten tension. Add more awkward, obviously orchestrated dialogue and directing.Will the girls escape the potentially horrible ending they fear might happen? When will the James Macavoy acting clinic open? Will his accent change? Take Macavoy out of the film and this is a direct to video stinker that no one will remember. Sets a whole new bar of low.","

It packs an adequate though dark , at times , cinematography by Mike Gioulakis . As well as a thrilling and frightening musical score by West Dylan Thordson . The movie revolves aroud a rare person with multiple personality , being full of intrigue , emotion , surprise , twists and turns . The film relies heavily on the bizarre personality of our starring and his claustrophobic ambient. Over-the-top performance from James McAvoy who gives a real tour-de-force , it results to be a James McAvoy recital , playing a great number of personalities , including the horrible superhero monster . Along with Betty Buckley acting as the psychologist who discovers his deep trauma , at last . The three enjoyable teenagers are pretty well as Haley Lu Richardson , Jessica Sula and special mention for the co-starring Anya Taylor Joy . As usual , Night Shyalaman shows up , a brief cameo in Alfred Hitchcock style as Jai/Hooters lover . At the end happens a surprising outcome when there takes place a dangerous confrontation in unexpected results with the appearance by the astonishing Beast , as Kevin has 23 personalities and the 24th is finally to be unleashed.The motion picture was well made by Night M Shyamalan , writing , producing and directing , though being some claustrophobic and slow-moving . He usually shoots in Philadelphia , this is Shyamalan favorite location . Night is an avid comic books fan , which was made in this film that along with ""Unbreakable"" , and ""Glass"" belong to a top-notch trilogy starred by Bruce Willis , Samuel L Jackson and James McAvoy. Well produced by Night Shyamalan himself , many of his films involve pivotal roles with extraordinary abilities or events happening to them and with children always having family problems . Night Shyamalan is an expert on fantastic and Mystery films plenty of Intelligence and thought-provoking issues as proved in : Signs , The village , Lady in water , The Incident , The sixth sense , with exception to an extreme flop as crítical as boxoffice : Airbender. Rating 7/10 notable . Well worth watching . Better than average","

"RIK-22","29 March 2017","So M Night is back. The man who has been on a downwards spiral, well, since his first film. The 6th Sense, was excellent, in my opinion. I liked Unbreakable, but Signs was garbage and nearly everything else he has done has been rubbish (the Village has some merit).Now this was interesting, no question. James M was stunning in his performance (similar to Filth, a brilliant film).However, I was waiting for the pay off at the end of the movie. I assumed that the girl was either all 3 girls or the girl was just one of the personalities, that might have been a clever ending, but in the end, nothing; it just ended. Huh? What was the point of the uncle story? It added nothing. I thought it actually might have something to do with the whole story, but no, totally meaningless.I gave it a 1, as it lead nowhere and was a waste of time. The acting of the 2 main characters was brilliant, IMO, so deserved a higher score, but the writer and director deserves a minus 10, which balances it out.Complete crap!","

Advertised as a suspense thriller, what we get instead is a more nuanced and subtle film that touches on many uncomfortable topics in its first two acts, and then becomes clinically insane during its final third, but in the end left me unsatisfied. First of all, how was my man James McAvoy? Really good. Each personality that he played felt distinct and completely different from the other. Some personalities were kind and sympathetic, while others were downright menacing and oozed filth. There were even scenes where (slight SPOILER) McAvoy was playing a personality pretending to be a different personality, and as a whole his performance was brilliant. I'll be buying this film on Blu-Ray for the sole purpose of watching his acting again, and also for Anya Taylor-Joy. Not only is she the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life (seriously Anya if you're reading this feel free to send me a private message because I am single) but she plays a character, Casey Cooke, that has a level of depth and characterization that is unheard in modern day thrillers. She isn't just a pretty face who makes the worst possible decisions known to man, as is the norm in horror movies. She is actually a fully fleshed out character who has a past that affects her present and the choices she makes. She makes decisions that only make sense when you go home and think about the things her character went through. Things she says or does may not make complete sense until you stop and think about her characterization, and I loved that about the film. In fact, even though I didn't enjoy this film very much, I really want to go and watch it again to pick up on all the little details about her character that I missed, and this just adds replay value to the film. Anyaoustly, sorry I mean honestly, she is truly mesmerizing and has a very hypnotic quality to her that adds to the surreal and fantasy-like tone of the film. Also, the opening credits of this film were masterful. They teased a schizophrenic pace, maybe something akin to ""Inland Empire,"" and even thought that isn't exactly what we got, the opening credits were enthralling nevertheless. But with all these praises, what didn't I like about the film?First off, it felt unnecessarily sexual at times. For example, (slight SPOILES in this here paragraph) one of McAvoy's personalities has extreme OCD and freaks out at the slightest hint of uncleanliness. So, when one of the girls that he kidnaps gets dust on her shirt, he makes her take it off and she spends the rest of the film in her bra. Similarly, another girl gets dust on her skirt, and if you can't guess what happens next, let me tell you: she is forced to strip off her skirt and for the majority of the movie she is seen in her underwear. Now I get it, I realize that this was meant to convey how much of a weirdo this personality is, but was it really necessary to have two females shown half naked in order to do this? The answer is no. It wasn't a necessity, and in my opinion it cheapened the experience. I didn't need to see two frightened girls forced to take their clothes off to know that this specific McAvoy personality was evil; I got that when he kidnapped the three girls in the beginning of the movie. It was just so uncomfortable (which was the goal, I know) and unnecessary, and it almost felt like, instead of wanting to contribute toward good characterization, M. Night just wanted an excuse to get these girls naked, and it overall took me out of the movie. Another thing I didn't like about this film is that nothing feels resolved at the end, and as a whole the film feels unsatisfying and unhappy. Now, I don't need every film to have a happy ending, but when you have a likable and sympathetic character like Casey, a girl who goes through what is probably some of the most traumatic experiences anyone could ever go through, at least let her have a victory at the end. (SPOILERS) Instead, what we get is an ending where it is implied that Casey, after living in Hell since her early childhood, goes home to even more unspeakable atrocities. It's ""sad"", as in go home, curl into a ball, and cry for hours ""sad."" And maybe you'll like this ending, and that's fine, but for me, I didn't expect, or want, to feel suicidal walking home from the movie theatre. I'm not being funny either. I seriously felt dead on the inside for hours. And speaking of nothing being resolved at the end of this film, the ending (mild SPOILERS) of this movie is a blatant cliffhanger for a sequel that will tie up all the loose ends and complete the story. Look, I get it, sequels are popular, but if you're going to make a movie where the audience doesn't know there is going to be a sequel to, you better at least make it have a strong and satisfying conclusion, but in my opinion ""Split"" has neither. And this is irritating. A movie shouldn't have to rely on a sequel to be enjoyable, especially if the audience doesn't know it's going to be the first (or second) movie in a franchise. The story feels wide open at the end of the movie, which is so disappointing, as the trailer seemed to promise a tightly crafted story. ""Split"" is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. The acting, the directing, the production value, and the music are all great, and at times are truly masterful. However, the relentlessly bleak ending and unfinished feel of the film kept me from enjoying it.","

"achmoye","7 April 2017","I think Shyamalan has been abducted by a multiple dissociative disorder guy, because I don't think he could have directed this crap. How come i can cry on some deep emotional movies, and How come i can feel NOTHING for Split ? How did he make this way to make me not care about any of these characters ? How did he fail that much, in his communication with the spectator ? The main actor is amazing but it doesn't matter. This is out-of-pace during 2 hours. Irrelevant flashbacks, general lack of rhythm and pacing of the action and emotional scenes. Actually this movie doesn't split anything, everything is faded the same way into this garbage aesthetic nonsense, so we have no idea whether to be scared or moved, but thats not the worst. The representation of dissociative disorder is cliché, childish, silly and ridiculous. Does he even know what is he talking about ? Cholesterol, really ? That is bio-lo-gical. Come on. Let me tell you something. I have known someone with these kinds of sickness. And that movie is a true disrespect to this medical condition. It's pure fantasy. Look it up, idk. Most of time they are NOT aware of their other personalities.Oh, and the girls and overly sexualized for no reason. pre-teens, laying down, running with no bra, are you kidding me ? is there a narrative justification ? And hunted by a wild beast ? Hell. I'm done, Jesus. What happened since Signs, sixth sense ? Is that Hollywood business bs ? Seems so.","

"pedroquintaoo","27 March 2017","The movie isn't bad, it's horrible! I've watched with high expectations, I was expecting a good thriller, full of twists and thrilling scenes like Don't Breathe (2016), but Split revealed to be the biggest disappointment of this year.The script is weak and full of holes, for example: the psychologist could have survived if she screamed the name that she wrote on the paper, the 3 kidnapped girls could attack the raptor and escape. In my opinion, it's not even a clever film, it turns out to be a fantasy/supernatural movie, the characters are uninteresting and don't create a connection with the viewer.The abducted girls are in better conditions than the viewers of this film, fortunately they didn't paid to see this crap.Rate: 1.5/10","

"Leofwine_draca","23 July 2017","SPLIT is the latest movie from director M. Night Shyamalan, a director who, shall we say, has been delivering some disappointing results over the last fifteen years or so. Films like THE HAPPENING and THE LAST AIRBENDER have diluted his stock in Hollywood and made him a laughing stock in some circles, so it's a relief to see that he's getting back on track with SPLIT.Not that this is a perfect film; I found it one that takes a little while to build up steam although once it gets going it really hits home. The story is about a killer with multiple personalities and the best thing about it is James McAvoy who does a great job with a very difficult role. The rest of the cast aren't so impressive, and the script at times feels more than a little pretentious, but overall this is low key and impressive, building to some startling moments, and a definite step in the right direction for a one-time Hollywood great.","

"imdb2-5","31 March 2017","It looks like India backs its Indian American director hero and has stuffed the ballot boxes here with high votes.What's sad is that M. Night's scripts are getting worse, if that is possible. I'll sum up this stinker in a nutshell. Crazy person with multiple personality disorders kidnaps 3 women for reasons that are unclear other than his being crazy. Then over the course of time you're told about how there really can be multiple people inhabiting the same body. And tales of the supernatural. And really, really, really bad and stupid dialogue. Victims acting stupidly as is needed for these films to work. And then of course the story of ""the beast"" within. Is it a really bad personality? Is it something else? Stay tuned while the pretty young ladies begin to slowly take off their clothing, which is par for the course for these films. There is very little reason to like any of the characters, which you don't get to know anyway. And some of the ""explanations"" are completely inconsistent with any type of logic or reason in the way people act.The only way I can understand Macavoy doing this film is someone stroking his ego about the tour de force performance it would require. And he does his usual excellent, intense job in trying to bring this stinker of a film to life as he plays about 2 different personalities that come off as prepared monologues that appear in random parts of the film. And it gets weirder and stupider as time marches along. Don't say you weren't warned.","

"criscal","21 July 2021","I think if I had paid attention to the director's name at the beginning of the movie, I would probably have skipped it. The director started huge with his break through movie ""The Sixth Sense"" and then every movie became more lackluster. The last movie I watched with knowing that he had directed it was ""The Village"".Anyway, McAvoy is doing a superb job at acting out the different personalities of the villain - even if the director didn't trust it so much and had him put on different clothes for each of the characters. The other characters like the girl played by Anya Taylor-Joy and the therapist are played very well and intensely as well.The major gripe I have is with the premises of the story. The multiple personality disorder had more appearances in movies and TV shows than in actual reality - which was one case only as far as I know. That is why it is so controversial. The movie takes this further and puts the premise that different personalities come with biological differences e.g. Diabetes.I guess they picked McAvoy because of his role in ""Filth"".Anyway, would definitely not see it again.","

"aqueerfailure","6 April 2017","A very nice horror/thriller. This ones takes on a story about a man with DID who abducts three girls. From this points , the movie twists and turn to finally get to the terrifying finale. It has got all the psychological and thriller elements but the standout performance from James Mcvoy is the one you will be terrified of. He portrays 23 personalities in one person of which on screen 5 are among main characters and share the most of screen time. To talk about plot , it seems similar but quickly turns out to be another thriller with it's own nice script and towards the end , it's not what you will expect. The films starts on a slow pace but once the setting is done , it moves forward with right pace creating suspense and only to become more terrifying. Especially a scene towards end will make you terrified of James Mcvoy for real. The fact that he and Anna Taylor Joy gave such outstanding performances makes it one of the best films. Sure , this will be a classic in the future among this genre.","

"trnjamesbond","16 February 2017","Just by watching the trailer for Split, we all know what this film is about. You guessed it, yes that's right, it's multiple personality disorder. Written and directed by the not so famous anymore M. Night Shyamalan, starring James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Hayley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula and Izzie Coffey. The film takes us on the journey of the latest craze, girls taken, and then locked in basements against their will. It's sort of a sado masochism type of film in a way, except it's captor(McAvoy) has many personalities running around, all the while still under supervision of a psychologist.Shyamalan goes through all the predictable steps to make us care about the victims and the villain, we get a surprise ending as to why we have to sit and watch this predictable rubbish, and it's end is just to make the studios buy into Shyamalan's work yet another time, it's all about money to further his venture's for another feature film.Watching the entire film, and after seeing it's final scene, I felt annoyed, and I wouldn't watch this film again. It's the same stunt he pulled with ""Sixth Sense"", this type of ""oh wow"" would of worked 25 years ago, but not now, society is just too smart for this type of silliness. This director is very cocky in my opinion, he's had a few good movies, but mostly duds, while riding on the coat tails of his so called inspiration Alfred Hitchcock. Copying director style is one thing, but making films with Hitchcock step for step direction is another, that's why Shyamalan to me is a sell out, he's doing it for the money, we all fell for that rhetoric with SIxth Sense and Signs, but those day's are over, and there is more younger director talent out there, and it isn't Shyamalan.","

The story is very solid and I really liked the ending. I honestly think people are just jumping on the ""anti-Shyamalan"" bandwagon.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","27 April 2017","Few filmmakers have faced the scrutiny M. Night Shyamalan has endured in the nearly 20 years since ""The Sixth Sense"" became a global phenomenon and launched his memorable name into the spotlight. With each progressive film, it seemed Shyamalan drew more and more ire for his twist-focused approach to horror and by the late 2000s, nearly all his projects were panned. With ""Split,"" he appears to be on the rebound.Shyamalan's upswing actually began with a nice reception for 2015's ""The Visit,"" a return to horror after a foray into sci fi/fantasy (to no avail). ""Split"" builds on that momentum as a psychological thriller that walks a fine line between expert cinematic tension and unabashed lunacy. The film contains both that which has, at times, garnered Shyamalan much praise, and also that which has been the source of much derision. Creating a horror thriller based on an actual psychological condition – Dissociative Identity Disorder – immediately positions ""Split"" in dicey territory. It could quickly come across as exploiting a serious issue for the sake of entertainment. Shyamalan works around this as best he can by naming DID and devoting exposition to it in the form of Betty Buckley's character Dr. Karen Fletcher, the foremost expert on DID and a therapist with a longstanding relationship with Kevin (James McAvoy), who has 23 distinct personalities. Part of the mystery is that Fletcher senses something is off, that Kevin is hiding something. She is part of the story, not just a way for us to understand it. From a social responsibility perspective, this is a better approach than the 2003 film ""Identity,"" which was more exploitative of DID.Of course Kevin is hiding something, as in the film's opening, he kidnaps three teenage girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy). Casey, the outsider of the three girls, draws on memories from her troubled past to try and understand her unusual captor.Everything hinges on believing McAvoy's performance and the script's ability to set him up to be believed. Both flirt with disaster, like at any moment we might laugh at the entire production, but we end up buying it. McAvoy really commits to Kevin's many personalities, which Shyamalan wisely limits to a handful. There's a logic and sense of purpose behind which ones show up at which times. McAvoy owns them to the point that we actually see them as different characters when they're on screen.Yet it's the mystery of Kevin's intent and what he might be capable of that keeps things tense throughout most of the film, a tension that shifts from mystery-driven to horror-driven in the final act. At this point, ""Split"" becomes a much stranger movie and we're surprised at just where and how far Shyamalan will go. In narrative and thematic respects, however, ""Split"" doesn't quite pay off for all that it builds up. Piece by piece we get to know a lot about Cassie, for example, and enter her psychology, but her role in the story doesn't contribute anything revelatory. She's merely a more traditional protagonist to root for, another troubled mind to understand. The biggest ""twist"" is actually tied to this weaker component, and it kind of flies in the face of everything else that's happening in the movie tonally. Not enough to derail it, but enough to remind you of Shyamalan's challenges as a writer.Even worse for the film's tone, a post-credits revelation that Shyamalan throws into the movie has a souring effect on its ending. It seems entirely unnecessary and makes Shyamalan come off as self- aggrandizing – but that's about all that can be said spoiler-free. Ultimately, here's a filmmaker who is figuring out how to deliver the best version of the films he wants to make and he's getting closer.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"arabnikita","8 February 2017","All the politics aside, what a disastrous movie. The idea for this movie was very interesting and if executed properly would have been a great movie but it failed so badly. First, the movie had 5 main characters and 4 victims and in 2 hours they couldn't manage to develop a meaningful back-story for anyone of them. I could honestly careless if at the end he would have killed all of them. Second, what is with all the excessive nudity and makeup, things like this is what makes thriller/horror movies bad and cheap. I mean the tearing of clothes, undressing and the final scene where she just gets into an ambulance and already has fresh makeup on... unbelievable.Third, another ridiculous and meaningless ending.. just get it over with and end everyone's torture.Finally, in America where every little pathetic thing involves child services, this 17 year old girl has gone her whole life being abused and didn't say anything... unbelievable.Props to James McAvoy for good acting but it still couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.","

He plays the role of a person with MPD (multiple personality disorder) and he plays the role(s) so darn well. The movie is the second in a trilogy of an adult comic series and comparing it to it's older brother (Unbreakable 2000) it's more refined and perhaps with a more interesting plot.","

"secondtake","4 August 2017","Split (2016)An interesting movie with some ""dumb"" aspects, like many horror films. The good part is how we see the villain (with multiple personalities) is slowly revealed through videos and a therapist. It's unlikely, of course, but actor James McAvoy makes it vivid and fun. And believable in the movie.The three teenage girls are made to be mostly clichés (one of them much less so) and in case you are wondering, yes, they end up miserable and in their underwear by the end of the movie. This is a horrible shame because it cheapens the whole thing, and the complexity of the McAvoy's character makes it unnecessary. I'm also tired of movies where innocent females are imprisoned by crazy men, with all the ugly power trips and sexual fear involved.There are some slightly superhuman aspects that get revealed (I think writer/director Shyamalan probably thought this was ""really cool"" and if you wonder about him, go see some interviews on youtube). It's fun, of course, but to me not the brilliant inventive movie some others have said. If you know any of Shyamalan's other films, you might quickly characterize this one as a lesser one (like ""The Village"") and by that you'll know that there are some really fluid, beautiful aspects to the movie, and some conceptual flaws that get in the way. But still enjoyable entertainment, so weight it accordingly.","

"sossevarvo","12 January 2017","Shyamalan's inconsistencies as a director are decidedly ignominious. He  spellbound us with The Sixth Sense, but soon after befuddled with lady  in the Water, provoked derisive jeers with The Happening, and merely  bored us with The Last Airbender and After Earth. The pared back horror  of The Visit signalled a renaissance for the auteur, with its genuinely  frightening aesthetic, and even a decent Shyamalan twist!   But, armed with what seems to be a more significant budget, and far  more loopy creative ambition, Split is Shyamalan's true calling card to  what hopefully is a far more fortuitous run of features. Using the  disorder of DID, and a true story (!), to create its bonkers premise,  McAvoy plays Kevin, a man who possesses 23 distinct personalities, some  of which are male and some of which are female, some of which are  young, and some of which are old, some of which are homosexual and some  of which are heterosexual, some of which have OCD or require insulin  for diabetes, and some of which are really rather volatile and  dangerous. The catch? The 24th is about to arrive, with all hell set to  break loose.   If this sounds like an actor's dream job, you're right. With the  opportunity to flex his acting muscles to the nth degree,  all-accent-changing, mannerism-altering McAvoy rises to the challenge  with a performance of breathtaking versatility. The film around him is  never quite as reliable as this towering performance, however. The plot  functions between an incredibly tense kidnapping/hostage situation and  a doctor who purports to be an expert of DID. While eventually serving  a narrative purpose, in the early scenes, Shyamalan's switching to this  doctor's narrative grinds the movie to something of a halt, leaving you  longing for the far more interesting story to develop and ultimately  resolve. That being said, the movie never bores for a second, thanks to  Shyamalan's distinctive style and an ominous score, as well as Anya  Taylor Joy, so impressive in The Witch, who proves she isn't a one  trick pony. In addition, like THe Visit, Split is, unexpectedly, quite  funny, in a way that never sacrifices tension, but rather serves to  enhance it by catching you off guard with scares when you're recovering  from a bizarre joke - it's a terrific tactic that serves the film well.  Most worthy of recommendation is the film's third act, which evolves  into something genuinely terrifying and ferociously tense, as twist  upon twist piles up to create a thrilling sense of chaos and dread.  Less convincing are Shyamalan's repeated attempts at motifs of beasts  and animals, which feel shoehorned in and unnecessary. Despite al this,  Split is a worthy work from Shyamalan that will deliver a jolt of high  octane thrills to your nerves, one which will certainly be needed in  the doldrums of the January dumping ground of films.","

"starving_college_student","25 January 2019","The storytelling is cliche, the idea/view of multiple personalities is dated, there really is no progressing story, and the 'thrills' aren't really scary/thrilling. The script of Split feels like a first draft, missing a few basic elements. Like usually in this kind of serial-killer kind of thriller, it starts off with a grisly murder, which shows what the bad guy is capable of and what the protaganist wants to avoid. Here we have nothing, not knowing why Kevin even wants the girls. This fizzles a lot of tension/horror. From there no real plot develops (no one looking for the girls) and an unconnected sideplot with the therapist doesn't push things along (and the flashbacks of the lead girl really don't add anything to her character or story either). Split then tries to do the typical Shyamalan twist, but there was no story/red herring to make the twist surprising. Like in the Sixth Sense, the movie was setup as a story about helping a kid who sees ghosts, until the inevitable twist that showed what the movie was really about. Here, with out that element, all you have is a campy origin story for a super villain whose only purpose is to setup for another movie (the next Unbreakable). The only saving grace to this film, and only reason to see it, is McAvoy. His performances are rivetting. Each character is unique and very watchable. I'm not sure it's enough reason to watch this film, however.","

"troy-daniel-bush","9 January 2021","Unpopular opinion, I think it's better than Signs. While I think Signs has plenty of redeeming qualities I think it has too many big problems going against it. (I've reviewed it already.) Don't get me wrong this movie has some big problems of its own, but we will get to those later.The movie is very well shot. Mike Gioulakis is a cinematographer to keep your eyes on, right up there with Roger Deakins. The shots were nicely framed and they had a slow, creeping movement to them and that really brought out the tension in the movie.The score also did a great job at bringing out the tension, as well as setting the tone. I especially love the song during the opening credits. And the opening credits themselves were pretty creepy.There were moments in this movie that were very disturbing. Disturbing to the point where you think, ""Most directors wouldn't show this."" Bravo, Shyamalan.There were a few subtleties in the movie. My favorite would have to be when Dr. Fletcher writes Kevin wendell Crumb on the piece of paper. Or when Casey hesitates to answer the police officer's question.Anya Taylor Joy did a really good job and her character had a good amount of depth. The decisions that she makes in the film make a lot of sense.Betty Buckley was pretty good. You could tell that she was doing the best she could with the dialogue she was given.And let's talk about the very best thing in this movie! Do I even have to say what it is? Let's just say that this movie would've crashed and burned if they had picked a less talented actor. He is truly one of the best actors in the world today. Even if he picks a bad movie he's still phenomenal.Now for what this movie did not do well:The other two main actresses were bad. I was happy when they got separated and put in two different rooms.There is quite a bit of dialogue that is not natural at all. It's not Last Airbender level terrible; you can tolerate it, but you can't help but be like ""No one talks like that."" And there are lines that were very unnecessary.There are a number of holes in the narrative. Like why didn't he separate the girls in the first place? Or why would he try to kidnap those girls in broad daylight? And why would he take them all at once instead of one at a time?I also have to wonder why Dennis didn't notice Casey in the car at first.So yeah, I do enjoy this movie and I find myself revisiting it every now and again. It's by no means as good as The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but it's certainly better than most of Night's filmography. (What happened, dude?) Something I should probably mention since it occurs to me that not a lot of people know this: Shyamalan wrote the script to this movie back when he was still making good movies. So anyone who said that he had returned to form with this movie, myself included, was very incorrect. Which explains why Glass was such an insufferable piece of crap.","

"CIDMoosa","7 June 2018","12 years back at Sreekumar theatre Trivandrum , I was going berserk over Chiyaan Vikram's multiple personality magnum opus Anniyan - and all of a sudden James McAvoy has outweighed that very specific standard of enactment with his once in a life time role in Split. Manoj Nelliate Shyamalan, that Indian prodigy who made sixth sense and sunk into oblivion with a chain of duds subsequently has made a magnificent riposte! Split sees the prolongation of Shyamalan's assignation with the supernatural but also a long anticipated rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to rematerialize. The film deals majorly with a person sustaining 23 different personalities within himself of which a 24th one is about to surface. Resting heavily on the lead actor who has done a magnificent job, the screenplay sways between his distinctive dispositions, transitioning from an OCD patient to a psycho woman and to a 9 year old boy, amongst 18 other manifestations. 3 girls are abducted by one of these personas and made to wait for the appearance of the last one before they should try and escape him. Living up to his expectations, Shyamalan has created a proficiently hewed psychological thriller which is darkly amusing. Very much commended for an exhilarating watch..","

"Mohsin-ci","5 April 2017","This is by far the best psychological thriller I have seen since Silence of the Lambs. McAvoy is amazing, the plot, the direction, the suspense everything keeps you on your toes from the beginning till the end. I would recommend this to everyone who has a sense of watching a real cinema.","

"max1174","18 November 2016","A welcome return to form for the director and James McEvoy gives one of his finest performances. I am not sure how many actors could achieve what he has executed so well here and one wonders if the film could have worked at the highest level without him. In between some of his bigger studio choices he has chosen challenging or interesting roles no matter how the films turn out and his range and talent always keep surprising but he takes it to another level here. I won't reveal too much about the film as others will do that, except to say it was a great film to watch in the theater, full of suspense and in some ways quite touching and meaningful, even if you do or don't like the final twists you'll be drawn in to this story and on the edge of your seat in more of a suspense mode. I wasn't sure if the film would go beyond a typical kidnapping film in the first five minutes but I can assure you its completely different to any expectations you'll have despite the director putting some of his more traditional touches on the film towards the end of it which really work in this case. I've always liked his earlier films as they often look at human conditions or flaws with imagination and some of his films have fallen short but he sounds like he's become more open minded and enjoying his work returning to form so well here and all I can say is well done, he has great attention to detail and gives his all. This is a great film if you want an original suspense/thriller go and see it. I was sorry to see a review that put this film down, those reviews are off the mark this time round in my opinion I hope there is more to come from the M Night daring to be different again, his lower budget work is outstanding and easily brings out his best storytelling. James McEvoy you've smashed it here and given you're all it was worth the risk, keep taking them! Having attended the Q&A he comes across a decent humble man which I would think gives his performances such resonance and skill. Also a great performance from Anya Taylor Joy she's a talent as well. Go see the see the film, especially in the threatre on a big screen it will have you on the edge of your seat.","

"diaju_vampprincess","29 April 2017","Thank God i didn't have to waste my money to watch this movie on the theater. Well, the promotion and the trailer seemed promising, and it turned out to be overrated, because the movie is so boring. Kinda disappointed with James's acting, i believed he did his best for the role, yet i didn't think i could feel all the personalities he represented. He was a great actor, I knew he could do so better than this movie.As for the movie itself, it was very typical and predictable. It wouldn't scare you psychologically (i think it's what psychological thriller means, right?""). Anyway, these different personalities knew each other. Except for the real personality, Kevin Wendell Crumb, didn't realize that he had a dissociative identity disorder (i thought he knew after his therapist told him?). Kevin only knew he had a passed out period time, when his other personalities took over. Unfortunately, Dennis, the vicious personality who kidnapped the girl knew that all could happen as your brain made it to be. So he created the 24th personality, called the Beast, and he could call out the Beast whenever he wanted. All i can say is, great idea is poorly executed. So just don't waste your time. This movie is not what they've told you.","

"michaelRokeefe","26 May 2017","Not the best from M. Night Shyamalan, but damn near close. Don't take the bad reviews for fact until you see SPLIT for yourself. Gripping, dark and psychological meandering. The story line is not all out scary; is not supernatural really; but haunting with scattered anxiety. Three young women are kidnapped and held captive by a man suffering with his agonizing 23 different personalities that may even hint toward a 24th. These attractive girls must play their own mind games to find what personality will be of any help in their escape.James McAvoy is outstanding weaving the different personalities. And Anya Taylor-Joy is the stronger of the captives. Very disturbing thematic content with violent behavior. Also in the cast: Haley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula, Betty Buckley and a cameo by Shyamalan.Worth a repeat watch with some friends.","

"adamjohns-42575","13 July 2022","Split (2016) -It is weird to have a slight crush on James McAvoy in this film, playing someone with 23 different people inside his head, but I do. There are very few occasions when you get to see them being an everyday person, but there is a slightly sexual component to things that makes him appealing, but maybe that's just me.The everyday people aren't the interesting personalities of course, so you don't see them much at all, except for a fantastic montage type part where some are shown in more detail via recorded video messages, which I think is a smart way to explore them.James was absolutely superb though and I cannot believe that the Oscars wouldn't even touch this film, because of it's subject matter and that Mr McAvoy didn't clean up all of the awards everywhere. It takes a lot to impress me, but this really was a phenomenal performance on his part.How did he do it? I mean there are times when they flip from one personality to the next almost instantaneously. That must have taken some rehearsing.And it's also very odd when you think just a year before that he also made 'Victor Frankenstein' (2015), which was dreadful.The story is very clever and interesting, especially when you consider that it is based on a real person. I can only imagine how hard it would be to live like Kevin (Person 1) does. I'm actually trying to avoid referring to myself as we, when I have conversations in my head, for fear of releasing another person hidden deep inside. The one I've already got is bad enough and my other person would end up being Patricia, I just know it!It's an intelligent story, well thought out and researched. Some say that it has had a detrimental or misrepresented effect on people that suffer with Dissociative Identity Disorder (D. I. D.) and the causes that support them, but I for one feel educated by it and fascinated by the possibilities of the human brain as a result.I can see that people with only pleasant multiple personalities may feel misrepresented, but that's not the point of this particular story. I'm sure a film about a more everyday case of D. I. D. To show the other side of the coin would be just as interesting if someone made it as a comparison.This film though, is a little bit crazy and horrifying in its subject matter and really intense, but somewhat compelling to watch even as someone who hates horror and psychological films.I could easily make comparisons to 'Whiplash' (2014), 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971), 'The Departed' (2006) and '12 Years A Slave' (2013) in the respect that those films are really not to my standard tastes, but so well executed that the things that upset me personally, because I'm a wimp, are not enough to score them low. They are what really good film making is all about and so is 'Split'.The whole production and James' characters are excellent and I couldn't help but appreciate that.""I have blue socks too!""897.55/1000.","

"candelach","17 February 2017","This film and its ludicrous portrayal of Dissociative Identity Disorder sets back the progress we have made in the past years to end the stigmatization of mental illness. I am in no way of the belief that films should never be problematic but if you are going to go somewhere like this, there should be a reason for it. If you want to provoke, please do so but not just for the sake of profit. There was literally no need whatsoever for this film. The ""bad guys"" with the multiple personalities have all been covered in the 1960s-80s. Why go there now? Why take a backlash and put hundreds of people with this illness at risk for further discrimination?","

"classicsoncall","17 January 2019","I'm probably like a lot of the viewers for M. Night Shyamalan's films, in that I felt his best efforts, ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", came early in his career and he's struggled to match the intensity and credibility of those pictures. ""Split"", I think, gets him back on the right track with a psychological thriller that contains elements of horror, not so much for what you see on screen, but what your imagination suggests might be terrifying. I thought James McAvoy did a commendable job in a role calling for a split personality with multiple characters. I also thought the picture cleverly included a back story for the character of Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), who was able to relate to the 'Hedwig' portion of Kevin Wendell's (McAvoy) psyche by virtue of being an abuse victim herself. The only thing I get frustrated about in stories like this is when the main protagonist is outnumbered, and the 'victims' can't or won't come to an understanding that they could take him out if they joined forces. Now maybe the 'Barry' facet of Wendell's alter-ego might have been too strong to overcome, but the 'Dennis' or 'Patricia' personalities might have succumbed to a three on one attack. Easy enough for me to say because I've never been in that position, and each of the kidnapped girls individually were too traumatized to take direct action initially. Then once they were separated, the 'gang up' option went away. The final scene of Bruce Willis reprising his character David Dunn from ""Unbreakable"" was a neat way to whet the appetite of Shyamalan fans who would never have expected a follow up to that earlier film, and I for one will be on hand to see if ""Glass"" restores some of the magic of that masterful film. My only other comment is reserved for Betty Buckley portraying the sympathetic psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher, who's painstaking patience in attempting to reconcile Wendell's twenty three personalities ultimately ended in tragedy. Wisely, the story didn't try to account for all of them, and in Dr. Fletcher's case, it appeared that eight was enough.","

"Sammy_Sam_Sam","16 January 2017","I'm going to start this review by stating that this isn't a particularly original film - there are already quite a few out there which do the same thing, only far better. Only last week I watched 10 Cloverfield Lane, which is broadly similar, yet a far superior movie. The reason 10 Cloverfield works (the final 10-15 minutes aside) is that you always feel John Goodman's character could lose it at any moment. And from time-to-time, he does. That movie really had me on edge and the tension was almost unbearable at times. Unfortunately, 'Split' did not do this well. The runtime and pacing is probably one of the biggest issues, because a movie like this set over 117 minutes really needs to be handled by a master. I don't know much about this director, but he's no Kubrick. And although Kubrick could be self-indulgent (Eyes Wide Shut was a catastrophe), a film like The Shining runs for well over 2 hours, but the suspense and atmosphere carries it all the way. With Split, the film lulls and drags you really don't believe you're going to see this 'beast' they talk about till the very end, which is a big problem, because you're not on the edge of your seat. Perhaps sharper editing would help and personally I would've cut it down substantially, but that still wouldn't have made it a great movie.McAvoy gives a decent performance, but I'm not about to overstate it. I saw a film called 'The Love Butcher' the other day and the almost unknown actor in that film also played many characters quite successfully. Lots of actors are capable of this and I'm sure many will cite McAvoy's performance as being a key element of the film, but for me it doesn't save the movie. If you want campy fun of this sort, check out John Lithgow in Brian De Palma's Raising Cain! Other acting in the film is absolutely fine, although you don't get to see two of the girls all that much. This again is another problem, because this sort of film really works best when you can put yourself in the place of the victim(s). It doesn't really dare you to do that, as it moves from place to place, but doesn't focus on their plight.There's a huge plot hole something which one of the characters should have said near the end of the movie, but I won't elaborate, as I don't want to spoilt it. It's a glaring plot hole though! To conclude, it really does drag so much and I couldn't wait for it to end. It gets to the point where you know everything there is to know, but it won't stop. We're just treated to more 'performance' from McAvoy, but by this point, you won't care. I could recommend at least a dozen similar films without a second thought which are far better than this, so I honestly wouldn't waste your time. There were a few laughs along the way, but by the end of the film, you certainly won't be laughing. Overall, for me it's a 4/10.","

"BA_Harrison","17 January 2019","M. Night Shyamalan's Split is essentially one long 'set-up' movie, introducing us to the many personalities of disassociative identity disorder patient Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), as well as teen-in peril Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), both of whom play a part in the director's forthcoming Unbreakable sequel Glass.As such, the film feels a little inconclusive, but still manages to be fully engrossing thanks to a standout performance from McAvoy, who brilliantly handles his character's many personalities, and a likeable turn from Taylor-Joy, who plays one of three teenage girls abducted by Crumb as food for his burgeoning twenty-fourth identity, the Beast.The film is a bit head-scratching at times, but Shyamalan pulls it all together nicely for a rousing finale, and tops it off with a surprising end credits scene guaranteed to leave fans of Unbreakable champing at the bit for the next instalment in what is becoming a delightfully unorthodox superhero series.","

The last time I went to a movie based on a high rating was to see ""It Follows"". It should have been called ""Sh&t Follows"". THIS one should have just been called ""SH&T"". Save your money!!!! M.

"hitchcockthelegend","2 February 2019","Split is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley, Haley Lu-Richardson and Jessica Sula. Music is by West Dylan Thordson and cinematography by Mike Gioulakis.Three girls are kidnapped by a man with a diagnosed 23 different personalities. They must try to escape before the apparent emergence of the 24th - known as The Beast...We now know that Split is the second instalment of a trilogy by Shyamalan that began with Unbreakable and is ending with Glass (released 2019). Always proving to be a most divisive director/writer/actor, Shyamalan has returned to the sort of noticeable form that had him earmarked in his early days as a director to follow - with the proviso that inevitably this is going to still infuriate some for its handling of the subjects at hand.The plot trajectory is simple enough, girls kidnapped by a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder, as the girls in fear try to escape, a number of his personalities put in an appearance. Which builds up to the finale, which explodes after following on from the suspense and dread atmospherics so beloved by the director. In the mix joining the mental health issue with our main protagonist is a good meaning doctor (naturally), and the spectre of child abuse rears its ugly head. So not a movie to be cheered up by then! While if looking for a detailed and attentive look at the mental health issues to hand you will be disappointed.However, there is a style to the picture in how it draws you into the predicament of the main players, boosted no end by McAvoy on irresistible form. Given licence to chew every scene, he delivers his various characters with great relish and no little amount of skill. Props to for Taylor-Joy, who as the lead kidnappee has deftly blended youthful innocence with resourceful strength (aided by Shyamalan's writing of course). Conversely, Shyamalan is guilty of just making a pic for entertainment purpose, which works as it's a very good creepy thriller with its black humour moments, but the mental health plot devices ensure his gimmicks will not be welcomed by all. 7/10","

"ediesedgwick-46930","14 June 2017","firstly, i have to compare this movie to La La Land, because this is what is considered Oscar material and Oscar performances in 2017. If La La Land was an Oscar movie, this is effin' citizen kane. Loved the bruce willis cameo and that there is a cinematic universe somewhere between all those uneven films. This film delivers. It has an amazing performance and realistic characters in a surreal nearly sci-fi but engaging plot. There is no twist end. Not really. There is a bitter end this time. One that stays with you for a while after the movie ends. There is a desperation where there was once a ray of light in the ending. The film is occasionally funny and aware of it and is not easily categorized. It is a subtle commentary on many many things, violence, abuse, human nature, relationships, sexism, modern society, the potential of a human being, racism, the idiocy of the average people, our traumas, madness, the virtue of patience, existential angst etc It is true that it is a horror movie about a sick person, which may not be politically correct but is a very old and common trope in horror flicks. It is also true that this film turns the trope on its back, presenting us a charming psychopath. He does unspeakable things, but he is not evil, he is beyond morality and he has an ambivalent point of view. The movie doesn't take sides. Murder is not a taboo in this narration, it may be an act of God or some creature close to him. The characters that surround the protagonist are also flawed in many ways and not very likable (with a couple of exceptions). There are obvious (and delightful) references to Psycho and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. One thing is certain. This movie is not for people who always had it easy...","

"ironhorse_iv","12 February 2017","After emerging in the 1990s and early 2000s as one of the top horror directors thanks to films like 1999's 'The Sixth Sense' and 2000's 'Unbreakable', it's no secret that M. Night Shyamalan's career began to experience an unfortunate downward spiral starting with 2002's 'Signs' leading up to the truly irredeemable 2008's 'The Happening'. Even when he try to film, other genre like 2010's 'The Last Airbender' & 2013's 'After Earth', he continue to fail to connect with his audience. However, in 2015, it all change as he return to form with 'The Visit'. That movie became a surprise hit with critics and horror fans. It even show the first signs of a possible comeback. With that reconnected with his audience, Shyamalan released his newest stylish psychological thriller 'Split' about three girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor Joy) being kidnapped by a mysterious man (James McAvoy) whom been diagnosed 23 distinct personalities; as they must try to escape before the man's deadly 24 persona takes hold. Like 'The Visit', a few years earlier, 'Split' mostly received generally positive reviews from both audiences and critics. For me, personally, I thought it was one of his very best written film yet, even if two of the three victims are thinly-thought of. At least, the third, Casey, is given a semblance of multidimensionality via a series of flashbacks that plays a big part in the climax of the film. Anya Taylor Joy does a great job, showing us, the quiet and raw emotion that not many other actresses her age are capable of. We wanted to see her, survive against the mental disturb man. The movie did portray a very good, Hitchcockism 'Psycho' mysterious-like vibe with the mysterious villain, ranging from the OCD neat freak, to an innocent child-like being to a creepy motherly figure. Mad props goes to James McAvoy for making a haunting man with 23 personalities seem somewhat real, even if we only see 7th of them. Still, I like how each one of them, has its own strengths, physical traits and flaws. I also like how each one has with its own unique ways of managing Kevin's fears and protecting him from the world around him. It also amazing to see some of the personas impersonates others, during the explosion dumps scenes, such as the ones, he has, with psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Nearly every dialogue having some subtle mysterious purpose, foreshadowing to what is to come. While, some people still hate the movie for how it portrayed, dissociative identity disorder. In my opinion, the psychological aspects of dissociative identity disorder are presented accurately to how they appear in medical literature with diagnosis often being difficult, as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders, and malingering often happens. While, it's true that most people suffering from 'DID', are more of a danger to themselves, than to other people. I do have to say, there are 'DID"" people like this, who trick and hide the pain from others. Even with cameo of Shyamalan, these scenes, along with Mike Gioulakis's cinematography with the sinister, windowless, underground lair, smoothly snaking with corridors, dingy doors and pipes, and harsh pools of light, adds to the suspense that already full of physical dangers to the girls, whom trying to escape through structural weaknesses or trying outsmart their deranged captor. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game of epic, psychological proportions, packed to the brim with a few surprises and more than a few unexpected twists and turns. One of them, like the supernatural powers might seem a little too out of this world, but it does come from real-world theories about the elastic limits of human possibility. While the supernatural subplot seem to come out of nowhere for the viewer that wasn't paying attention. There were some great subtle foreshadowing of that, within the movie. A good example is the scene where one of the persona has to take insulin shots. Who knows, if that was for the diabetes or to help with having extreme abilities like super strength like a shot of steroids!? Another, would be the sight of the mysterious man, mourning his father, disappearance at the train station. Could his father, be one of the victims of Eastrail 177 crash!? All of this, could be, possible, as the film concept for this flick was originally written for a different, previous movie of Shyamalan. So, don't be, too surprised of the twist, toward the end, at the diner. Overall: I will say that if you're a stickler for realism, you might want to save yourself the frustration. While not perfect, with the help of his actors and technical crew, Shyamalan has created a film that feels less like a standard horror kidnapping tale, and more like a legitimately moving story about self-discovery. This is a smart movie that will undoubtedly leave viewers thinking -- and discussing. If you have enjoyed any of M. Night's smart movie before, then there is a good chance you will enjoy this horror flick. Highly recommended.","

"ericrnolan","8 April 2017","For much of its running length, I was considering writing a review for ""Split"" (2016) that rated it a perfect 10. (I am an unabashed fan of M. Night Shyamalan, no matter how reviled he is by other Internet commentators.) I love the way he frames his shots, I love his dialogue, I love his stories, and I love the strange way he can make a slowly paced film nevertheless absorbing.)And ""Split"" looked nearly perfect. James McAvoy handed in a tour- de-force performance as Kevin, a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID). (Yes, I am aware of the clinical controversies connected with whether the disorder even exists — I was a psychology student many, many years ago. I think we should suspend whatever disbelief we have for the purposes of enjoying the movie.) McAvoy plays his role to perfection. His ""Dennis"" persona is particularly frightening, and ""Barry,"" one of the ""good personalities"" he portrays, is surprisingly endearing and sympathetic.Playing off McAvoy wonderfully are Betty Buckley as his gentle psychiatrist and Anya Taylor-Joy as one of three teenaged girls kidnapped by his nastier personalities. The talented Taylor-Joy was also perfect in her role. (I last saw her 2015's ""The Witch"" and she was also in last year's ""Morgan;"" I'm gaining the impression that this promising young specializes in cerebral horror-thrillers.)I would rate ""Split"" an 8 out of 10. It suffers a bit, I think, from two missteps toward the end. One, this taut psychological thriller takes an ill-advised turn into dark fantasy. I thought it was amazingly good as a thriller grounded only in the real world — it was far less so with the later jarring story elements. (I do realize why Shyamalan made this creative decision, and you will too, after watching it and then reading up on it.) But I still think that this would have been a perfect film if the majority of it focused on McAvoy's personalities either aiding or misleading his psychiatrist, with Taylor-Joy's fate hanging in the balance.Two, this film seemed to suffer from the too-many-endings syndrome that people often associate with Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. We seem to have one denouement that works quite well, then a second that should have been re-shot and re-scripted. And then there's another plot strand finally addressed  but it is played so subtly that I'm not even sure I got it. And this isn't even counting the significance of the movie's final line, which works as a fantastic framing device.About that line  if you're a Shyamalan fan, then you simply must watch the film until it's very end, as the camera pans through the coffee shop. You'll love it.","

Its just like reading a fictional book with a new twist and turn, which ends with good win over bad. What the movie shows is not a individual's mental illness, but what human mind is or can be capable of. The power hidden as explained in the iceberg theory, the not wandered territory of human potential, in turn manifesting into good and bad. Great actors and great delivery. Shyamalan movies are never disappointing, and this one definitely meets the next level of entertainment.

"acinemafan","27 April 2017","Sadly, the big weakness of this movie is James McAvoy. He's a good actor, but this movie tested -- and went beyond his skills. He looks like he's performing in ""Split"" -- even looking like he's in an acting class, projecting different personalities. It may be an odd comparison at first glance, but his many scenes can be compared to Brando in ""Apocalypse Now,"" with the focus directly on him and how he emotes. And McAvoy just comes up short. For me, he just didn't hold my interest.And then there's the loose end of the one heroine. Very odd back story pertaining to her, that has no closure. Quite dissatisfying. Now, one may argue that her story is realistic, but that realism is incongruent with the main story. It's a side story that just doesn't fit.Disappointed.With all that being said, if you find McAvoy fun/intriguing to watch, you may love the movie. It relies almost completely on his performance.!!BIG SPOILER!! As the story played out, and knowing that twists are Shyamalan are his signature move, I thought we'd see that the villain was a certain character's son from a previous Shyamalan film. But that was not the case.","

Director/writer M. Night Shyamalan has crafted an abduction thriller cum multiple personality disorder with his signature twisted ending, but overall not near the greatness of The Sixth Sense, Signs, or even the more recent The Visit.Three teens are abducted by Kevin et al., whose promise that a ""Beast"" is coming to devour them does spook the bejesus out of them. The more canny of the three, Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy from the surprisingly effective The Witch), is the heroine destined to grapple with that Beast and the personalities that wander around this bunker-like world (Remember the locale of 10 Cloverfield Lane?) The director directs way too many close-ups of her for my taste, and the usual horror tropes like jump scares aren't sufficient to mask a fragmented plot that mirrors the split personality disorders. Outside forces like the kindly shrink, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), are actually peripheral to the power of Dennis and his army of identities.Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill used a split personality motif to explain bad behavior; Hitchcock, a big influence on De Palma and Shyamalan, used most of Split's bag of tricks, especially in Psycho, long before Shyamalan knew what personality was; United States of Tara showcased for TV the DID state to some notable success. Split will not meet the ""classic"" criteria they have achieved.Because payoff for Shyamalan has always been the twist ending, he doesn't so much disappoint as confuse, with unfortunate explanations that sap the challenges a smart thriller should offer.""I've never seen a case like this before.

Coming out I can't help but call myself disappointed in a film that has as much potential as wasted one, thrown away in a structure that can't keep focus of what it's doing.Even with that, there is still quite something to be appreciated here. Firstly, it is hard not to be wowed by Shyamalan's mastery in technique. He clearly demonstrates being comfortable in the medium and plays with the audience in several different ways. From the little touches in insert shots to the big, big set-piece shots he always adds something special and uncanny to them. Be it twenty three different toothbrushes or a single closing shot on a lock, his images have something to really sink in and love about them and he is a master in the use of focus to build tension or character conflict.Then McAvoy as always is in solid acting territory and gives an intense performance, you can see the work he put into this oozing from the screen. The way he switches from a personality to the other is brilliant, you see a change in his face and posture and it makes it incredibly special. Moreover the work he puts in physically pays off, it reads on screen powerfully and makes the difference for the whole film. Surprising is how well Anya Taylor Joy manages to keep up with him delivering an equally functional performance.Where the film really looses its charm for me is in its script. Unfortunately it is highly unfocused and does not know where to go or what to do with the compelling premise, indicative of this is the final twist which I barely managed to grasp.There is no order in how the story evolves, we give the main character an extensive backstory in flashbacks and that leads nowhere, there is a mystery with the relationship between Kevin and his psychiatrist and that leads to nothing too, then there is the main conflict in the kidnapping story that leads us nowhere once again, with possibly the worst resolution of all of the above. And then, at the center of this, is the character of McAvoy, who is as fascinating on paper as he is chaotic on screen.There is no silver lining with this character, there is no pay off, no purpose to his story, he is simply a gimmick. Consider too the fact that of the supposed 23 personalities we only see seven or eight on screen which makes for a hugely underwhelming experience. Moreover, when you consider the fact that of the ones we see there are only a couple that get any development you understand what a bloated journey the view is carried through.Which is exactly the way I would define the film, a ride that doesn't really have any idea where it is going, but has its moments of inspiration during the trip.","

"paul_haakonsen","19 May 2017","With the great rating and good reviews that this 2016 movie by director M. Night Shyamalan had gotten, I must admit that I was looking forward to getting to watch it and was hoping that this would indeed be a step up from the usual messy movies that he directs.And while ""Split"" starts out great enough, it quickly becomes apparent that this is just yet another story befuddled by his directorial skills. Sure, the movie had some great moments, but the storyline was just too predictable, and when the main character started to climb on the wall and ceiling I was just about ready to turn off the movie and find something else to watch.It should be said that this movie is watchable and enjoyable only because of the interesting and diverse performance that James McAvoy puts on as he portrays multiple personalities trapped within the same body.""Split"" is about as predictable as they come, and you got it figured out not way too far into the movie, and the storyline was suffering from that face, as if being relatively weak in storyline wasn't enough.All in all, James McAvoy carries this movie and makes it worth watching. However, ""Split"" is not an oustanding movie from director M. Night Shyamalan. The movie does have fans, that much is clear from the high rating. However, personally, I found it to be just a mediocre movie, and I wasn't impressed with it aside from James McAvoy.","

"donaldricco","19 May 2017","I swore I wouldn't watch another Shyamalan movie, and I should have stuck to that. While it is indeed, a thriller, and does a nice job moving up to a big climatic moment, this movie simply doesn't deliver, and it doesn't make sense. At least M. Night didn't give us another stupid-""gotcha""-ending. He just doesn't give us any sensible, coherent ending at all. James McAvoy is pretty darn good - maybe he knows what this movie is supposed to be about! M. Night really needs to stop. And so do I.","

"pyrocitor","5 July 2017","It's tempting to read the title of director M. Night Shyamalan's latest thriller as a cruelly reflexive play on the schism of his infamous filmmaking career: part I (the Early Days, where he was heralded as one of the industry's most visionary living directors), and part II (a slew of exponential misfires so inexplicably ill-advised no one, most likely including Shyamalan himself, quite knew what was Happening). Sadly, although Split does recall Shyamalan's early glory days (literally - to an almost inexcusably tacky fashion), there are mere hints of promise and potential here, skulking like phantoms amongst a film too mired in silliness and indecisive murk to leave too much of a mark. This isn't to say Split is a total write-off - there are trashy thrills to be had, and pitted against the bulk of Shyamalan's last decade of work, it's practically Citizen Kane. Still, it bears the melancholy mark of a fallen maverick who hasn't so much reclaimed his mojo as located the postal code it relocated to. If anything, Shyamalan is wise to play it safe, steering clear of sci-fi, fantasy, and airbenders with a taut tale of abduction and frayed psychology that almost amorously borrows from Hitchcock's Psycho. Still, in spite of this textbook familiarity, Shyamalan still(!) somehow manages a work as loopy and hard to navigate as any of his more labyrinthine psychodramas. On the surface, he's conjured a setting rife for a satisfyingly campy b-thriller a-la Sam Raimi, replete with jittery, claustrophobic camera-work, an appropriately creaky, ominous soundtrack by West Dylan Thordson, and contrived enough reasons to strip his captive coeds to make Sharknado roll its eyes. And, for the sequences when Split commits to pure, primal 'what's around that corner' breathlessness, like a slightly sillier but equally chilling bunker buddy of last year's 10 Cloverfield Lane, it is effective as hell, and pure popcorn fun. But, rather than committing to the amiable wink and nod, Shyamalan clouds his film with an uneasily out-of-place streak of (yawn) seriousness. To say the least, it sits uneasily with a wagon-load of aped genre tropes - a grainy aesthetic that hearkens back to the Doom era of action horror, hazy mental health fretting, Madonna/whore obsessions, clumsy flashbacks to our tortured protagonist's tortured childhood torturedly; even a healthy helping of cringe-worthy self- harm hero-worshipping? - that would've felt stale in a straight-to-DVD late night special from the early 2000s. The film's lugubrious editing doesn't help, making McAvoy's mysterious madman feel as sluggish as he is indecipherable. And if that wasn't enough, Shyamalan sifts in a shroud of self-important faux-mythology (wide-eyed characters whisper mental health bunk as if reciting sacred texts, conflating mental health disorders with superpowers in a way that is, amazingly, both cloyingly infantilizing and alienating as hell) that would be borderline offensive if it wasn't such silly claptrap. Then, for those masochistic viewers still desperately trying to wrangle the film into being worth it, try our arch-foe(s)' motivation on for size: McAvoy's multiple personalities (or at least some of them ) kidnap high school girls something- something confused sexuality something-something abused as a child blah blah worshipping superpowered Satanic death cult to punish them for not having suffered enough? Hel-LO-O! They're in high school! Methinks it's you who doesn't know the meaning of the word suffer, Mr. 'Beast.' Go back to pining over a rose. Maybe sing about it. And the invariable Shyamalan 'twist?' Only that nothing, not even standalone passion projects made by former art-house darlings, is safe from the encroaching, wearing mega-blockbuster trend towards interconnected cinematic 'universes.' Yes - our entire movie outing here exists for the sake of shoehorning in an almost staggeringly self-indulgent finale linking the film to Shyamalan's Unbreakable - a modest hit from 17 years ago(!) that a minimal percentage of viewers might remember offhand sans google - just so he can chase the superhero bandwagon like Tobey Maguire pitifully wheezing after his departing bus in Spider-Man? Nah. No thank you indeed. Good day to you, sir. The film's main selling, of course, is showcasing James McAvoy's range, with the kind of role actors fight tooth and nail to show off with. Thankfully, he's fairly excellent, and transitions so seamlessly between flamboyant personalities (including some pretending to be others... oooh!) with subtle shifts of face and posture. It's almost a shame that he has to contort to the dopey 'superpower' conceits of Shyamalan's script, as he's easily fascinating and scary enough on his own without crawling on the ceiling like a bargain basement Underworld counterfeit. Apart from the central novelty of McAvoy, Anya Taylor- Joy gives an impressively enigmatic, haunted performance as our leading teen, plagued by plenty of inner demons pre-abduction (though, again, she's better off emoting on her own right, rather than having her performance hand- held by irksome, unnecessary PTSD flashbacks). Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula are both solidly credible, in spite of the 'panting cheerleader' stereotypes they're saddled with, while Betty Buckley works her darnedest to ground her breathy exposition-dolling plot devise of a therapist with wry sharpness and astute charisma. The thing is, you want to like Split. You can practically smell the sweat on Shyamalan trying to rekindle his rep, and scorning poor McAvoy, practically bleeding energy onto the screen, feels like kicking a (psychopathic) puppy. And hey - if you're in the market for a silly, braindead little thriller full of nerves and amiable nonsense, Split will pass the time with a couple of jumps, shivers, and chuckles, both intentional and not. But as a purported comeback from the mind behind The Sixth Sense, and with another Unbreakable sequel that next to nobody will be waiting eagerly for still in the pipeline? Let's just say that none of us, least of all Night, are now strangers to the Beast's suffering litmus test of worthiness. -6.5/10","

"taylorhammons","28 January 2017","I don't know why I continue to expect greatness from this director. The Sixth Sense was phenomenal. Unbreakable and Signs were good. But after that, Shyamalan has let us down time and time again. The Visit was at least marginally better than anything we'd seen from him in years, so I came into Split expecting a comparable level of decency- something to further cement my theory that Shyamalan was making a comeback. Instead, I was met with a disjointed story that tried to draw unnecessary parallels between its heroes and villains. The two other girls seem important but turn out to be useless and dispensable. While McAvoy portrayed a convincing crazy person, his performance could not make up for the bad screen writing, nonsensical plot, and awful character development. To top it off, the ending made no sense and seemed it was supposed to be reminiscent of The Village. And, while the ending of The Village was stupid, the buildup was well timed and it was possible to see it coming. Split seemed to have failed in the one and only area where the Village succeeded- well timed plot twist. By the time Split got around to revealing the plot twist, we had stopped caring. It wasn't scary. It wasn't entertaining. It just didn't make sense.","

"hrmnrabb","10 February 2017","SPOILERS...I found this movie to be shallow, unfocused and obviously uncomfortable as is its intention. M. Night Shyamalan's alleged return to glory isn't very glorious at all. It certainly is creepy but not in an entertaining way. When the last 30 seconds is the best part of the movie and it's only that way because it references a far better Shyamalan movie than the movie you just endured is a failure. Setting up a future shared Shyamalan universe is intriguing but it relegates this movie to nothing but an extended DVD extra setting up a supervillain for a better movie to come. Massive bonus points for McAvoy's performance. The split personality characters he embodies really are the only reason to endure this movie. It's acting class on a Masters level. Everything else is sadistic, cruel and as entertaining as watching animals suffer.","

"Michael_Elliott","2 February 2017","Split (2017) *** (out of 4) James McAvoy plays a man with twenty-three different personalities who kidnaps three young girls and holds them hostage in an unknown location.Normally I offer up more more of a plot description but the less you know about this film the better you'll enjoy it. M. Night Shyamalan's SPLIT is certainly a very interesting movie that clearly seems to have been inspired by the various Brian De Palma thrillers that he directed throughout his career. I had a couple major issues with the film but there's still no doubt that the director-writer is back on top of his game in this well-made and at times tense thriller.What I enjoyed most about the film should come as no surprise. James McAvoy really gets to shine in this film as you'd expect since he plays so many different characters. I'm not going to spoil all of the personalities but it was really amazing getting to see a talented actor play a chess match and come up with the various different personalities and bringing little touches to each of them. There are a few scenes where the actor is forced to go from one character to another in the matter of seconds and he perfectly nails it. There's no question that he brings a wide range of emotions as there are times where you feel bad for him and other times where he's downright creepy to say the least. All of the supporting cast are good but Ana Taylor Joy deserves a special mention.The screenplay most takes place inside this unknown location where we see the three girls being stalked by one personality after another. The film exits the location a couple times including introducing us to the man's doctor who is trying to control the personalities as well as some flashback scenes dealing with the main girl's childhood. It's here where I think the film makes it's biggest mistake. I don't mind anything that's in the actual film but it ends up running at a 118-minutes and I thought this was a bit too long and slow. I think everything in the film could have worked much better with a faster pace and perhaps a tighter editing job.With that said, there's no question that SPLIT holds your attention throughout and yes, there's that ending, which I certainly won't spoil here but I found it to be excellent. It's great that Shyamalan is back and doing such fine work and I really can't wait to see what he does next.","

"Special-K88","10 December 2018","His name is Kevin Wendell Crumb...the only problem is he can't quite seem to get a handle on that. Suffering from dissociative personality disorder, he kidnaps and imprisons three teenage girls who are forced to try and use their wits to escape while dealing with his colorful array of characterizations. An intriguing setup is wasted in this sloppy, laborious blend of horror film and psychological thriller which lacks suspense, scares, or a really good payoff. McAvoy appears to be having a ball conveying all those various personalities, but the rest of the acting is so underwhelming, the plot twists and the exposition so ineffectual that it really doesn't seem to be worth the effort. You keep waiting for something interesting to happen...it just never does; a drab, unsatisfying showing. *½","

I won't give 1 star but 4 stars - I am doing so to even out the ratings. Story is OK, it could've executed better. Interesting concept but it turns out to be a clichéd typical survivalist story. The ending isn't deep at all. Another thing bad is the character development. We don't know what is going on and who everyone actually is. Overall the movie is pointless, a lot like Batman vs. Superman's Martha blunder that takes all the context out of the movie. When will people stop pretending everything wrapped out something unique and mystical is cool?","

"Fluke_Skywalker","8 January 2018","Plot; Three teenage girls are kidnapped by a man with Dissociative identity disorder whose various personalities perform an increasingly macabre play for his literally captive audience. The arc M. Night Shyamalan's career is an interesting one. Though not technically his first film, for all intents and purposes The Sixth Sense is the beginning of his career. For better or worse, that film's infamous twist branded him as the ""twist guy"". Follow-up Unbreakable was less successful both critically and commercially (likely due audiences expecting one thing and getting something else entirely), but has since grown in stature and may rank as his most beloved. Signs had Newsweek declaring him the next Spielberg and it seemed nothing could stop the Shyamalan express. Then came The Village. Though a hit, it was less so than his previous efforts, and the twist left fans divided. From there it was a bit of a downward spiral. Lady in the Water left people scratching their heads, and The Happening had them laughing in a bad way. No longer able to do M. Night Shyamalan films, he took for hire gigs like The Last Airbender and After Earth. They weren't catastrophic financial flops, but neither film was well received (though I actually liked After Earth). But then Shyamalan made The Visit, which did modestly well (though exceptionally well when juxtaposed against its tiny budget) and met with equally modest critical response (though exceptional when juxtaposed against his previous efforts this decade).That brings us to Split. A hit with critics and audiences, it seemed to signal Shyamalan getting his mojo back. This wasn't a for hire gig, but a return to the kinds of films he'd built his reputation on. The latter is certainly true. Whatever else it is, Split is pure Shyamalan. The first two acts are very solid, with Shyamalan slowly winding the string tighter and tighter as his principle cast do excellent work; particularly James McAvoy. Playing a man with 23 personalities (though only about a quarter of those are shown), he creates distinct characters. Sometimes transforming right before your eyes. It's impressive stuff, and worthy of Oscar consideration. Things fall apart a bit in the third act, as Shyamalan doubles down on the more fantastical aspects of the story with diminishing returns. A last second reveal does change how we view these events, and in this new context the last act works considerably better. Whether or not Split would've worked better as a standalone piece without the more fantastical elements than it does now merged with another of Shyamalan's works is up to the viewer. For me, I kinda side with the former, but I must admit that I'm intrigued to see where things go from here in the announced sequel.","

"Anyanwu","1 May 2017","I'm in most of the courts of the people that said this is bad. This was pretty much middle of the road when it comes to this kind of thriller or ""horror"". Cool idea regarding the disorder stuff. But, this runs with the movies like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER et al. The way the characters react to surviving and stuff like that. We are much smarter than that and the same old tropes that we see in characters are just annoying. Even down to young girls running around with no bras. So old. We can give it a couple of pts for the last seen just on principle. But as a film I am not in the court that says M. Night is back. But I don't give it a 1 cause the script although with some non plausible concepts was still there.","

"m3135_","16 January 2017","It's been a rough few years, but M Night Shyamalan's latest film Split proved that this director still has it.Firstly, James McAvoy's performance is the best part of this movie, his performance carried this film for me and kept me invested. McAvoy charms the audience with his brilliant (at times comedic) portray of the Hedwig personality, and does a good job making other personalities like Dennis, Ms Patricia and the beast frightening and creepy in their own ways. McAvoy does a good job separating the personalities from one another, making each seem like individual characters.The other performances in this movie are also good, Anya Taylor-Joy played her character fairly well, especially during the more dramatic scenes, and i hope to see more dramatic work from her in the future. The other two girls did decent jobs but nothing really special about their performances. Betty Buckley's character was fairly well done as well.Although this is a fairly well made film, i did have a few errors with pacing, the flashback scenes felt very shoehorned in and confusing at first. Shyamalan's camera-work and writing also seemed to be a bit messy at times, mainly during the first act of the movie, but was fine for the majority of the movie.However, although this isn't a perfect film, it's definitely worth a watch, and it's a good sign for Mr Shyamalan's career. Fans of his earlier work will hopefully appreciate this film like i did, especially the obligatory plot twist. :)","

"sunznc","18 March 2017","The film starts out interesting enough and grabs your attention. No problem there. Then, it shifts and starts down a road similar to ""Kiss the Girls"". Again though, keeping your attention. But it's sort of a cop-out, who wants to see young teenage girls held captive against their will? We can relate- the situation would leave anyone in a panic.Then it becomes a bit predictable when the girls try to escape several times. I mean, this is what we want right?Betty Buckley's dialog becomes a bit tedious at times and I rolled my eyes at the psychobabble. We've all heard it. Then we work through some suspense and finally make it to the ending and........THAT is where the big disappointment hits us. It's not only a letdown and completely unbelievable but then, there is an addition that just makes no sense whatsoever even after it has been explained to me. Frankly, I think I'm giving up on Sheyamalyn films and I don't even care if I didn't spell his name correctly. Yo know what his problem is? No one in Hollywood is willing to say NO to him!","

"animupizza","28 January 2017","Tired old trope of using a person with a mental illness as a plot for a scary movie. Unoriginal, and ableist.Mental illness, especially misunderstood illnesses like dissociative identity disorder, are incredibly stigmatized in our society. They're often seen as scary, and the people suffering from them are often labeled as dangerous, making it difficult for them to receive help and support. Movies like ""Split"" further this stigma. There is very little media representation for people with DID, many people don't know much of anything about the illness, so when movies present it as something that makes people dangerous, others have no reason not to take this as a fact. In reality, people with DID are not abusers, but people who themselves have been abused. DID is an illness that develops after long term exposure to trauma occurring before the person turned nine years old. It develops because the trauma is too much for the young person's brain to handle, so their personality ""splits"" off into different parts, so that they don't have to. Movies show these alters as violent, but really, people with DID are usually only a danger to themselves. Showcasing them as the kind of people who would kidnap and abuse teenage girls is a gross inaccuracy, that again, wouldn't matter so much if it wasn't basically the only media representation of this illness.Because of the belief that these people are violent and dangerous, not only is it difficult for them to find support, but societal biases are often internalized. Mentally ill people are not violent abusers. But the stigma furthered by these movies contributes to the belief that they are. Mentally ill people need support, they need to be normalized, they do not need any more horror movies that use them as the scary abuser. I hope that in the future we can move past movies like this, and towards acceptance. Mentally ill people deserve better.","

Unfortunately, McAvoy performance is the only part of the film worth watching. I will be spoiling the end of this film but since it hardly affects the actual story, I wouldn't worry too much about spoiling the experience. I was under the impression that Shyamalan was striking out on a new path of successful thrillers but the ending of this one relies too heavily on past success. Under on of the influence of his personality known as Dennis, McAvoy's Kevin kidnaps three young women, Marcia (Jessica Sula), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), and loner Casey (Anya Taylor- Joy). The three women don't do much to fight back against their captor and Casey refuses to cooperate with the other two for fear of the extra strong Dennis.

The pacing of this movie is also extremely terrible of the overall plot is pertaining ridiculous. I the movie really began to go hit downhill with the main character changes from someone with mental illness to a strong powerful almost supernatural creature is intended on destroying the lives of people. The movie almost makes it seem like it's better for them to die. This is extremely problematic considering the movie initially talks about having a real-life mental illness. Also the way to dissociated personality disorder is shown is inaccurate and extremely weird. The movie is very inconsistent sometimes it makes you try and feel sympathy for the main character and other times it depicts him as an unstable monster. It's not shopping at the still is terrible because M night Shyamalan is known for terrible movies. He made one good movie and never made another one.

Night Shyamalan that i haven't had enjoyed this far since well, maybe ""Signs"" back in 2002, i kinda thought that there won't be a any twist at the end (kinda even can't remember times where a movie by this director was an event film) - but i was surprised more then i could imagine after i heard a very familiar and great theme back from a very good director's movie back in 2000 and the there was HE! No spoiler - but count me in for any sequels from this ""universe"".Now back to the ""Split"" - i did enjoyed this movie a lot. This is a tense, involving and intriguing thriller where once my favorite M. Night Shyamalan is on his good form - writing was good, dark and involving - its like non of those shxx movies before have ever happened (and you know what movies i do refer). Acting was very strong by James McAvoy and good by Anya Taylor-Joy. Directing was solid - the movie is intense, good / dark looking and moody thriller. Overall, hopefully M. Night Shyamalan has returned to the form for which i enjoyed his movies A LOT (to say the least) in the past and he will stay with it. ""Split"" is a proof of this - an involving, intense and just a good thriller.","

"jtindahouse","2 February 2017","In a Hollywood completely lacking in originality and creativity, M. Night Shyamalan remains a shining light. Say what you like about some of his films, but the man continues to put out original, thoughtful and sometimes brilliant material. There's no questioning he's gone through something of a rough spell after the incredible start he had to his career. 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakble', 'Signs' and 'The Village' are all some of my favourite films to this day. Films like 'Lady in the Water', 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth' on the polar opposite end of the scale are completely unbearable to watch and deserve no praise at all. It has been a bizarre career to date containing the highest of highs, and the lowest of lows. 2015's 'The Visit' however was a hint that he may be righting himself again and now 'Split' has absolutely confirmed it. Shyamalan is back baby!I was completely hooked by 'Split' from the moment I first saw the trailer. What a brilliant concept that lends itself to so many possibilities and so much potential. James McAvoy in the lead role must not have been able to believe his luck when he was offered the part. A character with 24 different personalities - an actor's dream. I thought he was quite brilliant in the role too. He completely sold me on every personality he performed and brought a tremendous level of intensity to the role. The only problem with the film I could possible perceive is a slight lack in advancement of the story. Things can feel a little stationary at times with an almost two hour run time. Other than that though this is near perfect film making. All of Shyamalan's class as a film maker is on show. The opening scene is brilliant, the flashbacks are masterful and the final scene of the film will leave you shivering (if you're anything like me). The brilliance of that final scene is unlike anything I've seen in a very long time. Shyamalan is back and that is brilliant news for film lovers around the world.","

Anya Taylor-Joy, Jessica Sula, and Haley Lu Richardson are all exceptional actors who delivered fine performances here.James McAvoy is the star of this show and his performance is the make or break of this movie's soul. How can an actor handle and portray so many characters simultaneously? Every character that McAvoy portrays here is brilliant. I can say that McAvoy pretty much steals the entire show with his performances.Split likes to play on situations. What would you do if someone attacked you? The movie illustrates that you have no idea what you would do if a life or death situation arose. I found myself yelling at the screen during certain moments because of the idiotic decisions I thought the three main characters were making. However, no matter how idiotic I thought their decisions were, I know that everybody's different, and nobody would handle every situation the exact same way.Split plays out like a puzzle builder; You constantly get small pieces of the puzzle as the movie progresses, but you don't get a clear image as to what you're looking at yet. The movie feels obligatory once all of the pieces are in place.The music and the directing here is great.Overall, I enjoyed this movie for the most part, but it felt obligatory once everything was said and done. I know what this movie ties into and I won't spoil it, but the final scene truly establishes the rest of the movie. However, that little piece of information doesn't excuse this movie's obligatory nature. I'm stuck in the middle with M. Night Shyamalan's Split and I truly believe that he can do better than this.Final Grade: C","

"saptesh786","23 October 2020","Not to deserve 7 or above but only for 3 or 4. The main reason is that it failed to create a horror drama as expected. First it is a long drama, while horror drama continues we see doctors consultation session repeatedly along with flash back
of Casey makes loose impact of thrill and tension. Secondly multiple personality is not shown properly. Why do he go off the screen to change the personality ? We have to see multiple personality in a single sequence. Both kidnapped girls do not have daring or any idea how to flee away it is not realistic. Move length is so long and boring. Why do so high ratings for such stupid movie ? I can't stand till end. Do not waste your time and money for such garbage and nothing movie.","

Everyone already knows the U.S is not exactly the safest place on Earth and the parking lot is very often where sh*t goes down so this is some slack script thinking to begin the movie with. And why the hell does the girl who notices things are wrong does nothing she had plenty of time to open the door and run away while the other 2 girls were being sprayed in the face.

"vze2363v","8 April 2017","I'm going to leave a couple of blank lines just in case you didn't see the SPOILER warning...but apparently it doesn't work. First, I'm going to say I don't particularly like horror movies, so if you're a big horror fan, you MAY love this movie. I hate any movie where women act stupid, helpless, slow...you get the idea. Poverty makes a woman intolerant and if you are a strong woman, this movie is going to seem like someone is slowly scratching their nails across a chalkboard. By the end of the movie I was hoping the beast would kill the victim!The story line is simple. Stupid girl doesn't pay any attention to her surroundings, stupid girl let's guy drug her and her two friends with aerosol, guy shoves 3 stupid girls in a locked room and keeps them there while he goes through his alternate personalities. There are plenty of chances for girls to escape, run away, but then they get all ""oooo, I'm a girl, I can't use my brain, I have to be helpless"" and they get locked in different rooms. In the end, multi-personality guy changes into a mutant and kills his shrink and two of the girls. When he gets to the last girl we painfully watch as she just acts idiotic, drops shotgun shells all over, has a chance to kill the beast by shooting him multiple times at his C1 vertebrae, but does she do it? NOOOOO, she just lets him get away. Now there's a mutant killer running around free. At that point I was hoping a large piece of the ceiling would kill her and put US out of our misery. Instead she continues to act stupid, mousy, like she owes the guy because he didn't kill her. In the end, there's a special cameo that tie's into another M. Night Shyamalan movie. I will never go to another horror movie again.I know people will say, but it was all about a mental health issue and it was supposed to be complex, etc. My friend wanted to share the joy of the X-Men movies with me as I'd never seen them, so I'd watched all of them in chronological order (including Logan). I also watch Legion on TV, so I'm over the whole multi-personality thing. Again, if you like horror, maybe you'll like this. If you HATE watching women acting stupid and helpless, stay away from this film. You'll be doing yourself a favor. Buyer beware!","

They soon find out that their captor have multiple personalities, and they have to struggle to find ways out before a monstrous personality harm them.""Split"" tells an engaging story of three girls trying to escape from their terrible ordeal. Right from the start, we see one girls handling the situation differently than the two other girls. The captor, played brilliantly by James McAvoy, is captivating because he can switch personalities effortlessly and quickly. The personalities portrayed are distinctly different from each other, and James McAvoy separates them well. The plot kept me thrilled and on edge throughout, and I enjoyed watching it.","

"natamity","7 April 2017","Let's be honest: The film is pretty bad. I was almost laughing in parts where humour was not the film-makers intention. I came on here to read some of the reviews as I remember when I added this film to my watchist it had a high IMDb rating. What could others possibly have seen in this film that I didn't? Well, not much apparently when you work your way through the obviously fake reviews with some being so brazen as to repeat the exact same review a previous fake profile had already submitted. The site is rampant with them! The same must be the case with the Metacritic scores where certain reviewers are obviously being paid off. How sad, really. The director also produced the film and I see it has grossed millions already. It's a great money making tactic.. you have money so you can put it into making a bad film, then invest more money in buying Metacritic scores and fake IMDb profiles to boost its ratings and create a hype around the film, ensuring enough people will see your film in order for you to turn a hefty profit. This experience has soured IMDb for me. It's a great source for creating your own lists and exploring films, but take the IMDb ratings, reviews and even the Metacritic scores with a grain of salt.","

"EvilAxe","3 May 2017","With time being our most precious commodity, I try to carefully select the movies I do watch, as I don't have a ton of time to watch them. But the hype around this movie, and of course the (mind boggling) 7.4 IMDb rating tempted me enough to give it a chance. I sat down excited with my favorite snacks - hoping to be in for what some called 'one of the best horror movies this year so far'.Wow.... really? Horror? This is NOT horror. It's a suspense thriller / drama at best. This movie couldn't even scare a 12 year old. And THIS is supposed to be the ""return of M Night Shyamalan""? What? I absolutely loved Signs, and The Sixth Sense is amazing too. But his movies since have gone down hill. The Visit was very lackluster and pretty disappointing too. But not as disappointing as this stinker. At least with The Visit - there was no claims or hype saying this was his 'return to form' so I didn't expect a lot. But Split? This is more like a terribly executed amateur film students idea of a ""thriller"". The first 20-30 minutes, the movie has your interest a little bit as you wonder about the kinds of twists and surprises you are about to treated to. Maybe the guy is a ghost? Maybe there are actually more than one main protagonist? Maybe the girls are in an alternate reality? Maybe there is an actual, physical, hairy (as they describe him) monster that we will soon get to see? Oh man...that would be cool.. These are things I was eagerly thinking as I was watching, hoping I would be right, and that if so - these plot twists could turn this how I would have written if it I was behind it.But nope. As time goes on, you realize, there is NOTHING exciting happening. Just some incredibly boring dialogues, a character study of multiple personality disorder, some dumb girls trying to escape, and several conversations between a shrink and her patient. *Yawn* The ending? I was half asleep at that point but it was extremely underwhelming and disappointing. So the 'beast' just looks like the dude, just with some veins popping out, and he can climb walls? Wow, amazing. Not.Save your time and do not listen to the positive reviewers. I think they were paid by Universal Studios to bring up the overall score here.","

"cherold","20 October 2017","Split is possibly the most creepy and suspenseful movie of director Shymalan's career. This dark film follows three girls kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities, brilliantly played by James McAvoy, whose transitions from one personality to another are seamless and who maintains a disturbed, threatening quality through all of them.The movie was, however, slightly wrecked for me because I was trying to guess the ""twist"" that some critics claim the movie has. Here's the thing to know: no one would be saying this movie had a twist if it wasn't directed by someone famous for his twists.A twist is when you are lead to believe something and then your perspective is shifted. It's something Twilight Zone did a lot.Split certainly has plot turns, some of them interesting, some rather unconvincing, but none all that surprising. This is a movie about suspense and character, not brilliant plotting. If you spend the movie, as I did, trying to figure out how Shyamalan is going to flip everything on its head, it will take you out of the movie and lead nowhere. But if you just appreciate the beautifully constructed shots and the flow of action, you'll be impressed.There is something very surprising in the last second of the movie, but it's not a plot twist because it doesn't come out of the story. Most people will have to google the ending to understand what it means.This twist distraction is not Shyamalan's fault, but that of critics determined to talk about the director in twist terms regardless of the movie. I just wanted to let people know that, as a public service, so that they can enjoy the movie without false expectations. Because it's well worth watching.","

"KrabbyPatties","28 January 2017","Have never wrote a review before on IMDb but logged in just to comment on how inexplicably bad this is. First of all, how is this crap film getting 9/10s and 8/10s? I am genuinely asking because I cannot comprehend how anyone who has seen this film would rate it in that manner. I got duped by all the favorable reviews praising M.Night's new thriller and walked into the cinema with great hopes, shining, bountiful hopes, despite the utter tragedies of the films he had directed before. It seemed like a great concept, DID + James McAvoy? I was so ready for this. Now a big portion of why this didn't work out was because of the script. It had all the hallmarks of amateurish writing. Gaping plot holes, corny and cheesy dialogue, scenes that made you want to scream at the characters for making extremely poor decisions etc. One of my biggest gripes were that the 3 main personalities they crafted for James McAvoy seemed to be very stereotypical. You had the uptight, OCD, neat-freak Dennis, the tranquil Patricia, constantly wearing a shawl to convince us of her innate zen-ness and finally, Hedwig, a 9 year-old with a crippling case of the lisp, yadda yadda ya, he has his precocious moments as most children do, nothing very interesting. Hedwig was also oft used as a plot device to inject humour into the film, I did not think they meshed well with the overall tone of the movie, scenes where he popped up were enjoyable but at the same time felt more like a tick off the checklist, the attempts to introduce levity throughout the film did not flow well and felt contrived. I would say McAvoy did a great job with the material he was given but bad writing is after all, bad writing. The stilted dialogue didn't help things at all. The 3 teenaged girls did not fare well on the acting front as well. I have watched Anya Taylor-Joy in The Witch and she did pretty good there so it was somewhat puzzling to see her performance in this movie, granted it was better than the other 2 but it was still rather lacking. I would've thought being captured by a deranged madman would have been much more frightening than how it was portrayed in the film.Going into the third act of the film, the psychiatrist made some extraordinarily bad decisions, including investing too much into a patient, visiting a patient with 23 personalities, some rather dubious in character, in the middle of the night. By herself. Without informing anyone else. Really? Fast forward into the film and she's been drugged by Dennis. The first thing she does upon awakening is to write down the full name of Kevin, which we know is the one thing that is capable of pulling him into the light and giving him the power of his own body. She, however does not utter the name when the Beast is attacking her, does not even bother to say it as she tries to stab him unsuccessfully over a long drawn out moment. Yes, the Beast was squeezing her torso/mid body but she could still have said something (the way he constricted her body did not make it seem that she was unable to speak), knowing this was the only fail-proof way to get Kevin to return. Another gripe was the supernatural element of the film. The way they introduced the Beast felt so terribly banal and cliché. Veins bulging out of his body, ripping his shirt off, fleeing across urban landscapes in the dark, climbing and scaling buildings. It was like a watered down hulk? Hulk-lite? It wouldn't have felt out of place in a cheesy superhero flick at all. Except that it attempted to be a serious psychological thriller which makes me want to scream why, over and over again at the screen.And don't even get me started on the ending. (from the point that they discovered the girl) It went from a 5/10 to a 3/10. Some people enjoyed the Unbreakable reference, I found it exceedingly stupid, a cheap easter egg gimmick they threw in at the end of the film to give fans something to salivate over. Overall, I thought it had an interesting premise and extremely bad execution. Stop giving M.Night future projects. Stop indulging him in the same kind of shitshow he's been making for years. And for Christ's sake, if he's going to be making movies, please hire an actual capable writer to write the damn script and dialogue.TL; DR: Pros- McAvoy's performance, cinematography Cons- Everything else","

"OttoVonB","30 May 2017","From prodigy to punchline, M. Night Shyamalan has had fascinating highs and lows as a filmmaker. The man once hailed as the heir to Hitchcock or Spielberg was soon compared to Ed Wood and Uwe Boll... I always found this a bit unfair, due to the tasteful notes sprinkled throughout even his most inept films. But he's finally crossed a line.Celebrated as a return to form for the creator of the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, Split follows damaged teen Casey (Anja Taylor-Joy) and 2 cliché bitchy teenager friends, who get abducted by Kevin (James McAvoy). The catch being that his disturbed cranium houses 21 conflicting personalities, with the promise of a very sinister 22nd on the way. Intriguing concept. What might the twist be?There are - contrary to what you might have heard - two twists in Split. The first is that it mostly does exactly what it tells you it's going to do. And boy is there a lot of telling rather than showing in this overdrawn yarn! The beats are telegraphed in advance and the jumps predictable. The second twist plays squarely in the current trend of exploiting viewer nostalgia: in what might be his most forgettable film, Shyamalan dares to shove in a horribly contrived parallel to his greatest work. If Split is meant as a parallel sequel to that other film, then it shares none of the stylistic identity, which makes the forced kinship feel unnatural. Speaking of style, the filmmaker has also sadly broken with his earlier aesthetic in most of the ways you could imagine. The visual elegance and fluency of his first 3-4 films is gone - as, sadly, is longstanding collaborator James Newton Howard. After plumbing the depths of found footage in his previous film, Shyamalan delivers a film that is often bland and sometimes downright ugly to watch. Any positive commentary on this film has to do with its cast, so let's give them their due: McAvoy has a ball with his various personalities. It's never subtle stuff, but he throws himself at it and hops effortlessly between all 21 personalities in Kevin's head. Taylor-Joy, a revelation in The Witch, is, once again, luminous, transcending a half-baked part and giving these dreary proceedings what little believability they have. Her partners in confinement barely register, and, hamstrung as she is with terrible expository dialogue, poor Betty Buckly as the caring psychiatrist manages to deliver the worst performance in a M. Night Shyamalan film - yes, even one that features the customary terrible director cameo!By now the irony of this review's title - and of the situation itself - should be obvious. Shyamalan would have you believe he's come full circle, back to the glory days of his debut. The truth is much sadder: pushed to the limit and with nothing left in him, yesterday's wunderkind is left scraping the bottom of the barrel for echoes of past glories. In that sense, he is sadly representative of an entire industry with a crisis of creativity.","

"cschultz-2","23 January 2017","Fairly early in the filmmaking career of M. Night Shyamalan, the Philadelphia-based writer and director suffered a terrible professional misfortune—three consecutive films he wrote, produced, and directed became enormous critical and commercial successes.The Sixth Sense in 1999, Unbreakable in 2000, and Signs in 2002—and to a lesser extent The Village in 2004—were mostly lauded by critics for their innovation and imagination, and were embraced an adopted by audiences, many of whom returned for repeat viewings. The Sixth Sense additionally spawned a catchphrase—""I see dead people""—still quoted as among the most familiar in motion picture history.After those remarkable feats of box office legerdemain, critics began mentioning Shyamalan's name in the same exulted breath as Steven Spielberg—and worse, Alfred Hitchcock. Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan often included an unexpected, surprise twist in the plot at the end of his pictures, and also usually either played a small role or made a quick cameo appearance in his pictures. Unfortunately for Shyamalan, after reaching such a rarefied cinematic stratosphere there was precisely one way to go. And from Lady in the Water in 2006 through the almost unwatchable After Earth in 2013, and 2015's The Visit, the filmmaker has been mostly descending into a maelstrom of pedestrian filmmaking.But Shyamalan is trying to reverse his recent misfortunes: In his new picture, Split, released Friday by Universal Pictures, three teenage girls are kidnapped together by a man who reveals himself to be a disturbed individual indeed. The girls' abductor transports the girls to an undisclosed location and tosses them into what appears to be a damp medieval dungeon with cots and a spotless and well-appointed full bathroom.Quickly revealed is that the kidnapper suffers from dissociative identity disorder, multiple personalities. And while each of the man's twenty-three separate personalities seem vaguely aware of each other, only one or two appear to be in charge. Those couple of personalities are prepared to give profane birth to an entirely new manifestation, one which promises unspeakably bad news for the three involuntary guests.Split itself swiftly develops multiple personalities in the form of separate plots: It turns out the kidnapper, played by Scottish actor James McAvoy, has been in the psychiatric care of a renowned and well-heeled psychiatrist played by Betty Buckley, almost unrecognizable from her days as the mom on television's Eight is Enough.The good doc has apparently been earning a pretty penny from papers and lectures about her star patient's multiple maladies. And while the patient has of late appeared fairly benign, the psychiatrist—unknowing of the kidnapping—senses something unsettling enough to begin sniffing around to learn what's cooking.Meanwhile, back in the dungeon, the three kidnapped girls continue to plot, mostly unsuccessfully, to escape their confinement. And eventually it's learned that one of the three girls—the quiet, unpopular high school outcast Casey—has been raised in the footsteps of her loving outdoors-man father, and knows a thing or two about hunting, stalking, and killing prey.Mostly, Split is McAvoy's show, a real tour de force for the actor. It's sometimes forgotten that prior to the actor's recent steady gig as the young Professor Charles Xavier in the popular Marvel Comics X-Men series of pictures—three appearances and counting—as well as in plainly execrable garbage like 2015's Victor Frankenstein, McAvoy was once considered to be a talent of some promise, with performances in such acclaimed pictures as 2006's The Last King of Scotland in 2006 and Atonement in 2007.Possibly the challenge of playing and individual with twenty-three distinct and different personalities was McAvoy's means of groping his way back to his original promise. Unfortunately, the actor seems to perform each individual manifestation with a knowing little smirk, an implied wink at the audience, which keeps the viewer constantly aware that this is a performance, a stunt, and is not believable or credible so much as it is mildly impressive as an acting school exercise.The flip side of McAvoy's multiple characters is Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey, the kidnapped girl whose survivalist background—and whose own troubled childhood—might provide a key to escaping her confinement. Recently appearing in 2015's controversial and disturbing The Witch, Taylor-Joy contributes a performance which is competent but not particularly evocative—the audience is anxious for the character's situation more than for the character herself. Taylor-Joy with her wide-eyed, emotionless stare seems to be in a hypnotic trance most of the way through the picture's 117 minutes.There's nothing really wrong with Split—the picture delivers enough suspense, chills, jumps, starts and surprises to justify the cost of admission, although it's also sometimes tough to comprehend how the picture escaped the MPAA's clutches with a PG-13 rating when the menace and the subject matter alone should've earned at least an R. One genuinely unsettling early scene in which the kidnapper terrorizes his hostages even strays briefly into NC-17 territory.But thrills aside, the biggest casualty of Split is M. Night Shyamalan's reputation as an innovative filmmaker. Three plots running simultaneously is at least one plot too many. Subtract the survivalist plot and Split becomes a Classics Illustrated version of The Silence of the Lambs, a movie Split references endlessly anyway. Take away the psychiatrist's sleuthing and Split becomes last year's Don't Breathe, Ten Cloverfield Lane, or any of a number of the dozen or so other ubiquitous horror opuses which seem to open almost weekly Mostly, Split references Shyamalan's earlier successes—almost literally, thanks to a significant cameo and line of dialogue at the very end of the picture.But Thomas Wolfe could've told Shyamalan—you can't go home again. Instead, Split suffers from the very mediocrity the director seems to want to emulate from lesser films but exceed in quality and surpass in effectiveness, a feat Hitchcock accomplished in 1960 with Psycho. Possibly Split would've been more successful in its ambition had it been guided by the steady hand of a Steven Spielberg or an Alfred Hitchcock.","

I just finished watching it and feel like it's the type of film that will stay with me for many days afterwards. That final scene had me yelling out loud in excitement!It is the most ""M. Night Shyamalan"" film in years, so I can definitely see why people are describing this as a return to form. The complex spattering of themes throughout and bigger-life-picture vibe was certainly there too. Killer script and writing which is refreshing at a time when too many movies are becoming mundane or lazy.It also worked as good as any other thriller/horror out there. I wouldn't even know what genre to put this in - I don't think M. Night Shyamalan films belong in any concrete genre. I felt claustrophobic and uneasy watching this the whole time. In that sense, I didn't find it easy watching. But I couldn't look away.Much of the reason I couldn't look away was due to James McAvoy's career best performance. Seriously - how did this guy not get an Oscar nomination for this?! I've never really seen quite an acting display like it and he clearly loved performing the role(s). One second I would be laughing, the next I would be utterly terrified and getting sweaty palms.Features the best 'shrink' vs 'patient' scenes since The Sopranos.While I probably won't re-watch this, I'm still keen to say:Bring on 2019.","

"AudioFileZ","28 January 2017","Watching Split can be a frustrating experience if you wish too hard for the movie to go like it starts. With the abduction of three teenage girls by a genuinely creepy assailant Split gets off to a sinister start. Right away it becomes a James McAvoy acting class as we learn this isn't anything as one would expect. McAvoy has about two dozen personalities which his therapist believes she's getting both an education and a handle on. This is where some restraint might have kept a different thriller chugging along steadily building a more credible story. Of course this is M. Night Shamalayan so the paranormal has to be injected right along side the attempt at realism. It was brilliant in his Sixth Sense only seeming to weigh down what had so much potential here. It is not, however, a train wreck as it remains watchable slowly revealing the pathos of both the McAvoy character and Casey who is the odd-duck of the three girls. The hard-to-swallow part is how the McAvoy character continues to function being so out of control while manipulating his, we're led to believe, esteemed therapist, plus he's living below the NYC zoo in a secret madman's liar. A wall climbing scene totally jerks what little believably is left by the ending. Yes, with Shamalayan I know I should expect this, even though it comes off rather silly. Frustration is how good it started versus how it failed to use that start's potential fully. Plenty of folks are going to be ""split"" on this film.","

"rabbitmoon","18 January 2017","The best thing by far about Split is the performance by McAvoy. He has great fun switching personas, and the fun is infectious. Because of this, its best seen as a black comedy because you'll be smirking and giggling quite a bit at the little nuances. But without that performance, the film is pretty lame. The subplot of the girl captives trying to escape is nothing new, especially in an era of 10 Cloverfield Lane, Room, Green Room, Saw films etc. The therapy sections are extremely clichéd and dull, the old woman therapist badly underwritten. These scenes could have been so much more interesting. By the end, Shyamalan's immaturity as a filmmaker once again rears its ugly head, both trying to shoe-horn in some heavy themes (sexual abuse, self-harming) without any sensitivity or real emotional awareness, and also swerving the film firmly into absurd comic book territory. By this point its clear he didn't have a firm idea of the story he wanted to tell or why, just another gimmick that made itself up as it went, meandering all over the place. Basically, don't expect anything ""great"". Set your sights for a 2- star Netflix kinda film, then be pleasantly surprised by how fun and watchable it is (in a forgettable way).","

"aharmas","4 February 2017","""Split"" gives us quite a gift, an audacious and original film that will leave you wondering what you have seen, and it even has a theme: ""you can be whatever you wish..."" The question is whether you'll agree with that assessment. James McAvoy knew he couldn't pass on the opportunity to play a part (well, 23 parts within the same character). We get to meet Dennis and the rest of the gang when the stronger, but not necessarily best of the bunch have been plotting a take over. In order to fully succeed, we discover they need three sacrificial lambs.With a tight grip on the camera and his screenplay, we begin our journey into several types of hell: Dennis' own, the three imprisoned victims', the psychologist's slow realization that something is now more unstable than before, which could only mean trouble, and to add a bit of misdirection? a backstory for one of the trapped girls which might be more relevant than some people will be able to understand. ""Split"" is a film that you probably need to see a couple of times to fully comprehend. It's sort of like having a great meal, and then enjoying some of the best leftovers from that same meal, and the centerpiece is McAvoy, in a dazzling turn than leaves most of the recent entries in the dust, with the possible exception of Denzel, who like Oliver, Scott, Day Lewis are basically untouchable. McAvoy has joined their ranks, and he has done it with a performance that seems a greatest hits of any actor's career. In fact, he wears very little make up, and one of his most intriguing personas is a woman, but he is fully convincing in a creepy way, wearing a sweater, a long skirt, and not a hint of make up on his face. He retains his male voice, and yet, we believe we are facing a feminine entity. He is fully able to bring out every single element which is the trademark of each personality. The rhythm in the little boy's innocence, hesitation, and fear. His Barry is truly a joy to watch and Dennis is chilling. He manipulates voices, intonations, subtle nuances which fully transition from one to another. In addition to that, we have his incredible command of his physicality. His walking changes, and then we have his eyes and his mouth, doing some of the most impressive I have seen in hundreds of films. Day Lewis was glorious in ""Lincoln"" fully channeling the spirit of the President. I'm not sure where the 23 personalities came from. It's like he brought with him his family, friends, and most of the community he grew up with, and then there's the beast.The movie's preview seemed to have given us too much. We thought we knew how the whole story would unravel, pointing to a stock ending. Instead, we are traveling through a structure that shows much growth in the direction of the man behind ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", and ""The Happening"". The film is always suspenseful, suffocating at times with the tension originating from the various set ups. We expect bloodshed, mayhem, and what we get is worse because the fear of something worse is hanging over the girls' fate, and we are now caught in their hell, not knowing where the next twist is.The conclusion might seem problematic to some because it brings together every little bit in the background. It fully explains the triggers for both of the main characters, and if we have been paying attention, we'll understand why Casey's fate turns out to be so unexpected. Is there room for more to come? Just like De Palma, we have that twist at the end because after all there's strength in unity, and we never know what we are fully capable of doing if we set our minds to it.","

"miguelneto-74936","8 October 2017","Split is the new film by M.Night Shyamalan, it is a film that promises to be the director's return, Split is a very interesting film, and very strange also, that has as ""protagonist"" a face that has several personalities, interpreted impeccably by James McAvoy who deserves a very pro-Oscar nomination so far, is without doubt top 5 best performances of the year, the film is intriguing, full of mystery, Shyamalan's direction is very good but the script has some problems, I missed exploring more of the main character's personalities, if I'm not mistaken it just shows 7 of 23, maybe in the continuation have the rest, the rest of the cast has Anya Taylor-Joy who was already in pretty good The Witch, and she does more a good acting o the other actors are very well, and the end of the film is very good and links with another Shyamalan movie.

"CountJonnie","26 March 2017","Shyamalan built his reputation on two, maybe three movies. His trademark is his originality and twists, and his many failed attempts to recreate them.Split is about a man with various personalities. McAvoy succeeds into playing various interesting persons, but that is the only good part of this movie. The girls who get kidnapped, their acting is atrocious. Seeing them try, you can only blame it on the script and the directing. Same goes for the therapist, who makes certain decisions that will only make you cringe.As the movie struggles to stand, it builds up to some semi- supernatural ending, which is so stretched out, that all credibility is lost and even McAvoy can't tie all lose strings anymore. Shyamalan does succeed into creating a nice atmosphere, but fails in the simple basics: an understandable plot, believable characters and coherent conversations. All three are missing.The best thing you can say about this movie is that it isn't as bad as The Happening, or Lady in the Water. But it is far worse than the rest. The biggest twists are the reviews that pretend that this is a decent movie.","

"serpent_coil","3 February 2017","So Split is the latest movie from M. Night Shyamalan. Not having seen any of his movies since The Village nor being that familiar with the actors I didn't really have any expectations about this movie. Anyway, Split is a classic kidnapping-thriller. Three girls are kidnapped by an unknown assailant with multiple personalities and spends the movie trying to escape. Along the way they uncover disturbing truths about their kidnapper. In a parallel story the kidnappers psychiatrist suspects something and starts investigating on her own. Hardly groundbreaking stuff, then again there are plenty of fantastic movies with unoriginal structures. I was quite drawn in by the first half of the movie. The gradual reveal of the plot works fairly well. Sure, the dialogue was fairly wooden and there was little to no background on the main characters. The flashbacks that was supposed to breathe some life into the main character didn't really add much to the story or give much nuance to the character so much as being a pretty cheap plot device to tie the cheap ending together. For all it's flaws the first two thirds of the movie worked for me. The gradual reveal of the main antagonists personalities and motivation along with some decent acting from James McAvoy makes for just enough suspense to keep the viewer hooked. Like so many other movies the end is where it all falls apart. There is a special place in hell for writers who incorporate supernatural elements where there is absolutely no need for them. This movie would probably have worked much better as a semi-realistic thriller. The foreshadowing of supernatural elements are vigorously shoved in the viewers face during the whole film but I didn't really suspect they would be so over the top. Subtlety doesn't so much get thrown out the window as shot in the chest with a shotgun. Not to mention the protagonists escape that is heavy handedly tied to the forced flashbacks that plague the film and makes the end both over the top and anti-climactic at the same time. Honorable mention goes to the cheap tie in to Unbreakable in the movies dying seconds that seems lifted from a superhero movie rather than a sort of serious thriller. A seriously bad ending destroys what could have been a decent film.","

"jasonpauljones-64690","9 September 2022","The first thing I must mention is you will either like Split or hate it. I hated it. There is no in between here and just as its title prophetically suggests, it will divide audiences straight down the guts. MacAvoy's boring display of being able to adequately and already assumably act in different guises, feels like nothing more than watching an audition in a Hollywood theatre. I liked Joy-Taylor in Last Night in Soho but this is not the movie for her talents, being wasted as a submissive scared little girl instead of in a strong-willed attitude role. Shyamalan is the man responsible for the negatives in Split, as he is in every shite movie he has made, being awarded the prize of the most overrated movie maker in the world. In a woeful attempt to coalesce stigmas in society, Shyamalan presents immature and horrifically misguided ideals, which he obviously and obscenely wants viewers to believe and follow unconditionally. Split is dubbed as a Horror but for the first 90 minutes it absolutely is not. Two scenes were ok, the first being in the opening sequences, where the three girls are abducted in their car, and then 87 minutes later when MacAvoy's character(s) crushes the very annoying and thankfully eventually dead psychologist. The pay off is the end of the movie, as in The End, closing credits welcomed like a cold brewsky on a hot summer's day.","

"kermitkid","30 March 2020","I've had skepticism with M. Night Shamalayan lately. His films have been kind of hit-and-miss these past few years. I think if he does more of what he did with this movie, he can be back on top in a few years. This movie is crazy intense! It was actually a lot darker than I thought it would be. There are some extremely mature and dark themes and subject matter and it almost goes into rated R territory at points. However, it is these themes and subject matter that make these characters who they are, and explains why they act the way they do. James McAvoy's performance is particularly impressive. This film proves that he can play anyone a director needs him to play. There's moments where he's funny there's moments where he's chilling, and there's moments where his performance makes you hold your breath worried he'll harm you. The three young actresses in the film provide stellar performances as well. There's such range of emotion with them. You sympathize with them, you fear for them, you feel what they feel. Genuine, tearful performances, that actually look tearful and not like acting are hard to come by, and they pulled it off very well. Like I said, this film is very heavy. It's a hard PG-13. I don't want to advocate for this film due to the dark, heavy themes and subject matter so I don't want to say that it was a good movie. At times, it is very hard to watch. But judging it purely from a filmmaking standpoint of ""Was it well made? Was it well written? Was it well acted? Was it well directed?"" etc. the answer is yes. If you're a fan of M Night's earlier work, this hearkens back to that. It's still too early at this point to say if he's redeemed himself from the garbage that was ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth"", but if he can keep doing what he did with this film, he just might.

"samuelding85","17 December 2016","After exploring the lives of the boy who sees ghosts and the man who survived several man-made accidents, director M Night Shyamalan creates a thriller based on a person suffering from Disoriented Identity Disorder (DID). SPLIT was born under this idea, which aims to gives the audience a good understanding about DID, but ends up leaving the theater feeling confused. Three teenage girls – Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Claire (Haley Lu-Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) were abducted by Kevin (James McAvoy) at a car park. Locked in an unknown underground cellar, the three girls discovered that they were greeted by Kevin in different forms under different names: Kevin dressed up and acts like a straight man, a woman, a child and a gay guy. The girls soon discovers that Kevin is suffering from DID, which he lives with 23 personalities. Meanwhile, Dr Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) is seeing Barry (one of the personalities under Kevin), a young artist who claims that he is suffering from some personality disorder. While Dr Fletcher is trying to prove that a person suffering from DID have the ability to change their physiology, the three girls are using his various personalities to rescue themselves, before Kevin's 24th personality comes after them. As the title suggests, SPLIT was interpreted as someone with DID is living with split personalities. Though it was understood that McAvoy's Kevin was living with 23 personalities, only 8 personalities were seen in the entire film. With 8 personalities on display, this is not only challenging to McAvoy in terms of interpreting the respective personalities, it is also challenging for the audience to digest and understand the reason behind the distorted personalities. Audience were treated to McAvoy's interpretation on the different personalities he is living in, and how his respective personalities interact with his victims. However, this has starts to bore the audience, which some will find it time consuming and lack of interest, since everyone has more or less expected what will happens next. The first five minutes of the movie gets straight to the point directly, showing how the girls were abducted without any reasons. While audience were expecting to see how the girls are finding their ways to escape from their abductors, Shyamalan works differently compared to other movies which talks about how victims find their way to escape from their abductors. Audience were given an exploration on the lives of Kevin through his counseling appointment with Dr Fletcher, which was intervene with Casey's childhood experiences. The only link that brought Casey's childhood into the movie was towards the last ten minutes, showing how is she escaping from Kevin's 24th personality. With the overall presentation not shown in sequence, it is easy to make the audience feeling confused and distorted. McAvoy's portrayal of Kevin lives under different names through his different personalities. While it was mentioned in the synopsis that Kevin is suffering from DID and lives with 23 personalities, only 8 different types of personalities were showcased in the film. From playing a straight man, a lonely man, a woman, a child to a beast, McAvoy's performance was the only reason that kept the story from going on. Anya Taylor-Joy's performance of Casey is more of a compliment to the story. Her wit not only helps her to understand Kevin, but also serves as a way of saving herself in the times of danger. Somehow, the intervention of Casey's childhood trauma fails to compliment the story well, which overall it drags the duration of the film. To sum up, SPLIT has a hard time to identify its identity, which the movie is rather confusing. While McAvoy's performance saves the day and Taylor-Joy gets more screen time, this is another movie which Shyamalan is having a hard time to connect with his audience and fans.","

"jhenson-29069","4 February 2017","From the first 30 seconds of the film, they begin hitting us over the head with the fact that Casey isn't supposed to be with the other two girls. She's the weird outcast. She wasn't supposed to be in the car. McAvoy's hesitation with using Chloroform on her. There were only two beds. His female personality whispering about the ""two girls"". I could go on and on. She wasn't the target.They just continue giving the movie away so blatantly, that it's almost maddening as a viewer. There are four different instances before the beast appears where the personalities literally say ""you are pure, nothing bad has ever happened in your life, I have a special night planned for you"", while they are unraveling Casey's rape story.I mean, 30 minutes into the movie after the first clip with the Uncle, I was screaming at the screen saying ""Casey! Just tell McAvoy that you were raped and he will let you go!"".And then all the way to the very freaking end even after he is screaming about his hatred for ""pure"" people who have never had a tough life, she STILL can't grasp that all she has to do is reveal her rape. We have to sit there while M. Night unveils the scars on her body, as if it's the next coming of the ""Bruce Willis was dead the whole time?!"" reveal. Darn you, M. Night. You clearly treated us like we were stupid. But then again, I guess this generation of selfie obsessed egomaniacs isn't as smart as the late 90's generation.","

Shyamalan has never been this sincere and focused, not even in his brilliant first few films.

"nathannicolarobertscouk","26 January 2017","As with any general split, it starts off small and controlled and eventually frays at the edges, with its problems and flaws growing increasingly difficult to ignore. A victim of a terrific central premise, it demonstrates signs of delivering the potential and promise teased in the first act alone - but it eventually becomes too unfocused and complex for the sake of doing so. If we stuck with the idea of Casey attempting to talk to each of the identities, uncovering their flaws and exploiting their weaknesses, it would perhaps be a far superior horror-thriller, one fuelled by a smartness and sophistication; instead, it's rather run of the mill, ludicrous and frustrating popcorn flick that botches its climax with an uncomfortable development and shoehorned twist. It becomes a little laughable and that is the one place you never want to strand your horror film. Shyamalan The Director does decent things here but Shyamalan The Screenwriter lets him down - it's almost as if he is suffering from his own split.FULL REVIEW - goo.gl/SemOkh","

The personalities portrayed were far to stereotypical and in my opinion very average in there performance.The girls in this were exceptionally bad and did not convince in the slightest, the predicament they were in. I mean, cmon....you have just been kidnapped after a party which your Dad was taking you to and then he just disappeared and was never mentioned ever again by the daughter, her friends or the media. We never learnt what happened to him and no one seemed bothered.The (I believe) psychiatrist was again awful. After years of treating this man did she not have an inkling that something might be up? Nope....And then to the ""Beast"". Really???!!!! So not only now he has 23 personalities which is a very severe topic he can now not need shoes and climb up walls and eat people.What sort of film were you trying to make? No substance, terrible acting and a mish mash of genres.Only giving it 2 stars as the Dad was really good, albeit it for about 3 mins.AVOID!!","

"joecar5555","1 August 2017","Splits first 45 minutes are the best part of this movie with an intriguing look into the split personalities of Kevin, played by the excellent James McAvoy. It's within the small details of characterisation that astounds to still prove McAvoy as one of the best actors of this generation. His talent in being able to intertwine characters together is magnificent. Kevin and his 23 personalities respond well to Dr. Fletcher (Casey Cooke) who provides a great supporting role. This can not be stated about the Girls, they almost feel like a gimmick at times to keep your heart pounding. The movies aim in scaring is also unsatisfactory, hardly ever making the audience jump out of their skin. The overall story arc also slows terribly down in the last 30 minutes with some fundamental errors in storytelling almost dragging on too long. The dialogue in scenes, partially with the girls also seems a little trashy, I don't feel like Shyamalan captured these roles as well as Kevin and Dr. Fletcher. The score throughout the film keeps tensions a high but costume design feels a little rough around the edges. With constant swapping of personalities comes new costumes but at times characters don't adhere to what they are wearing which can occasionally become messy. Set design is also OK especially compared with the other recent Sci-fi, underground basement movie, 10 Cloverfield Lane. Overall, it is one of Shymalans finest films but still has many underlining problems especially with pacing and dialogue. 6/10","

"FlashCallahan","20 January 2017","Though Kevin has shown 23 personalities to his trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher, there remains one still submerged who is set to materialise and dominate all the others. Compelled to abduct three teenage girls led by the willful, observant Casey, Kevin reaches a war for survival among all of those contained within him, as well as everyone around him, as the walls between his personalities shatter apart.Split is the epitome of the term 'the final scene makes the whole film', because while Split is the directors best movie in fifteen years, some of the scenes in the film are almost fantasy, and appear not to make any sense, but this is why Shyalaman is such a wonderful storyteller when he really put his mind to it.McAvoy is completely wonderful as the troubled Kevin, and his performances are so good, you really believe that he is playing more than one different character, is it Shyalaman's sinister version of The Klumps? Of course not, but McAvoy morphs into the different personalities using nothing more than body language and voice changing, and it never once verges on the absurd.Camera-work is beautiful, with lots of close ups as if the film is almost analysing the audience watching the film.The kidnap part of the film is perfunctory stuff, and thank goodness the three girls get separated, because at one point, it almost verges on those awful teen horror remakes that polluted cinema screens in the noughties.Child abuse is a big part of the narrative, flashbacks hint at something more sinister, but it shows that the ones who get hurt, and are different because of major life changes, makes the person stronger, you hit rock bottom, there is no other way than up.Major Spoilers.............The twist of the film isn't something you'd guess, but it's a sequel of sorts, and it gave me goosebumps, and explained the fantasy element of the film.A wonderful film, and a return to form from the director","

"mitchell5954","27 January 2019","Split is deemed as M. Night Shyamalan's big comeback as a filmmaker, and I'm inclined to agree. To say Shyamalan has had a hit or miss career would be an understatement. His first three films, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, were all quality movies, but afterward the man entered into a fifteen long year slump starting with The Village up to The Visit. So, when Split came out we were all pleasantly surprised to find out it was actually good. Yes, Split is a good movie. Is it Shyamalan's best? In my opinion, no. Unbreakable is still his best work. Sixth Sense is also better, though I enjoyed this movie a bit more. However, this is still a solid movie; certainly the best the man has put out in over a decade and a half.The plot is pretty simple. You have three girls leaving a party but get abducted by James McAvoy's character(s), The Horde, a man with twenty-three personalities occupying his mind. Now these three must try to survive and escape their tormentor. Meanwhile James McAvoy's doctor is notices that The Horde is acting peculiar, and is attempting to determine what's happening.What carries split, and makes it as good as it is James McAvoy's character(s). Seeing this man playing all these different personalities so brilliantly is great to watch. His performance should have at least easily nominated him for an Oscar, which never happened. The film has an eerie look and atmosphere to it' something Shyamalan has always excelled at even in his bad movies. The score isn't one of Shyamalan's best, but it complements the film pretty well.Once we get to the third act it becomes a thrilling survival horror film, which is when the film is at its best, in my opinion. Usually, the third act is when most Shyamalan movies fall apart, but here it's the best part of the movie.I do have some issues with Split, however. It does feel slow in spots. Some of it does feel like padding. The film is just under two hours, when it could've been just an hour and a half. Also, while James McAvoy is a lot of fun, I didn't care much for the three main girls. The main heroine is okay, but the other two girls are nothing characters. The scenes between McAvoy and his doctor were far more interesting to watch, or when the doctor is trying to explain The Horde's condition to the other scientists.Overall, Split is a good film, and was a good comeback for Shyamalan. I hope he can keep the momentum going, though Glass has been pretty divisive so things appear shaky once again for him.","

"potterus_25","25 February 2017","the first 20 minutes was like watching Criminal Minds episode. not it is a bad thing, but if TV series can get you the same excitement, why bother go to cinema ? there is not enough story, not enough mystery, not enough twist, to be told in this movie. if you like to revisit old time feeling when you watched Scream or I Know What You Did Last summer, well, maybe you would enjoy this movie. i definitely don't. if you like split personalities genre, don't get your hope high. Split not even at the same level with Fight Club or even Identity.the things that disturbs me the most is how 'the writer' seems to enjoy half naked teens. one girl needs to take off her shirt, one girl needs to take off her skirt. and you would think they would go a little bit respect with female lead, but nope. save the best for last. she finally took her shirt off so they can save her character (rolling eyes). it is just so stupid and only shows how Hollywood movie and their writers exploit teen sexuality in a very smooth way and nobody seems to realize how sicks these writers are. i mean, it doesn't even contribute to the story line, or any character development (who ? dennis ? what a clever way to explain sexually mental disorder patient, huh). i mean, they could make the girls keep their clothes, and the movie will still be understood like it is. i don't mind with a little bit nudity when it contributes to the story (like in 3096 Days, as disturbing as it is, the girl nudity really give viewers better understanding of the kidnapper and the girl relationship). it's kinda suck for mc avoy, since this must be a very interesting character to be played. and as far as his acting goes, i don't have much complain. but got to be honest, his performance shone away by how bad the story is.","

The movie also flashbacks to a young Casey on a hunting trip with her uncle John.M. Night Shyamalan has regained much of his footing. There are some good scenes and the acting is great. McAvoy has the showy acting and he delivers. Anya Taylor-Joy does most of her work with her stone-face and those eyes. There is a nice sequence with a coat-hanger. I wonder if there is more tension to be had. M. Night keeps most of the violence off camera. I would definitely change the number 23 to something more manageable. Six would be more compelling as the audience counts up each identity. This is a solid addition to the M. Night library.","

"Hellmant","9 February 2017","'SPLIT': Four Stars (Out of Five)M. Night Shyamalan's new horror flick, about a man with DID (dissociative identity disorder) who kidnaps three young women and terrorizes them. Shyamalan wrote and directed the movie (on a budget of just $10 million) and it stars James McAvoy, Anya Taylor- Joy (who also co-starred in 'THE WITCH' and 'MORGAN'), Betty Buckley, Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been a huge hit at the Box Office. I enjoyed it as well.Three teenage girls are kidnapped, in broad daylight, while leaving a birthday party. Their captor is a man named Kevin (McAvoy), who also has 23 different personalities. Kevin locks the girls in a room, beneath a zoo, and continues to terrorize them; while demonstrating several different personalities. At the same time a psychologist, named Dr. Karen Fletcher (Buckley), tries to help Kevin. The doctor learns that Kevin is more than just a danger to himself, while the girls desperately try to escape him.Shyamalan used to be one of my favorite directors. I haven't been too impressed with his recent films, like many others, but this is definitely a well made movie. McAvoy is great in the lead, and I'm sure he had a lot of fun with the role. The film is both suspenseful and involving. There's also a great twist at the end, especially for fans of Shyamalan, and I can't wait to see what the filmmaker does next. It's not quite as good as his classic earlier work, but it is definitely an effectively well made thriller.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://youtu.be/RO7ghqXHCCY","

"halseyad","21 January 2017","The movie is really two separate movies thrown together, with the first half being the traditional slasher film and the second being the riveting MNS thriller. First 1/2- There are so many instances where you are screaming at the abducted girls to be more intelligent with their getaway. You will find yourself screaming.... A. ""Why have you not noticed the man sitting in the driver's seat of your family car is not apart of your family?"" B. ""Why do you react to slowly and calmly when you realize the previously stated even is taking place?"" C. ""Why does it take you almost a full minute to pick up your chair and hit the psycho in the head with it?"" D. ""Why do you hit him in the shoulder with the chair when common sense tells you to hit him square in the head?"" etc.Also, there is this strange sexual nature that is mentioned about the killer that never gets fully discussed. The quasi rape scene at the beginning leads to the Dr. saying the killer has a thing for women dancing naked, but this is never really needed in the story. This psycho-sexual fantasy he has is never revealed to be his original traumatic event, his motive to his actions, or even mentioned after the first half of the movie. Other than being used to scare the pee out of younger women (immoral pun) who fear sexual assault in our overly-sexually western society, this aspect to the killers psyche is irrelevant to the plot of the story. Second 1/2- This part of the film was great. Finding the uncomfortable line between reality and fantasy, MNS explores the possibility of superhuman capabilities that can be manifested through the mind when pushed to it's extreme limitations. Watching the movie, viewers find themselves wondering (alongside some of the characters) if there will be a supernatural manifestation. Very entertaining!Final Thought: Skip the first half, and just know that three girls get abducted by a man with DID and the psychologist that sees the abductor is suspicious that the personality she is meeting with is not the identity being portrayed. Pay close attention to the second. It's good.","

As the girls struggle to find a way to stay alive and escape, the man's therapist (Betty Buckley) starts smelling something fishy, while flashbacks show that Casey may have some similar demons in common with this mystery kidnapper.""Split"" is more of a psychological thriller than, say, ""The Visit"", and I think that really suits Shyamalan's filmmaking style. He's great at creating an atmosphere of tension and setting up some really creepy scenarios. There is even a sliver of ""real science"" permeating the film that at least tries to ground it in reality a bit. What it all adds up to is a film that is equal parts creepy and fun.That being said, ""Split"" doesn't always make sense or amount to the scale it seems to be built upon. In other words, the setup is significantly better than the climax. Even the traditional ""twist ending"" from Shyamalan, though present here, is of a completely different variety than his usual shenanigans (probably a good thing, though, in all honestly). Like I said, though, ""Split"" is just so much fun to watch as it's rolling along that its shortcomings are usually overshadowed.The acting in ""Split"" also goes into the ""plus"" column. McAvoy is truly a treat (a performance worthy of anything that will be featured at the Oscars), while Taylor-Joy continues to establish herself (after ""The Witch"") as an up-and-coming star.Overall, ""Split"" is the kind of film that epitomizes what Shyamalan is all about. It isn't his peak, but it does showcase his taut, spooky, madcap style of movie-making. It may not hold up to intense scrutiny, but it was one of the most enjoyable, exciting film experiences I've had of late.","

"bob-the-movie-man","28 January 2017","M. Night Shyamalan fizzed into movie consciousness in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense"" which – having rewatched it again recently – still has the power to unnerve and impress even after knowing the famous 'twist'. Since that film and his next, ""Unbreakable"" in 2000, Shyamalan has 'done a bit of an Orson Welles' by never really living up to that early promise. Here with ""Split"" he returns to better form with a psychological thriller that is heavy on the psycho.James McAvoy plays Kevin and Dennis, and Patricia, and Hedwig, and Barry, and Orwell, and Jade, and if the running time permitted another 17 characters. But this is no ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"": McAvoy plays all these varied personalities in the same body. For Kevin suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder, a rare condition where his different schisms not only affect his speech and attitude but also his whole physique. One personality for example is diabetic and needs insulin: all his others are fine.Under the care of MPD specialist Dr Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley, ""Carrie""), Kevin seems to be making good progress. But all is not as it seems. Dennis, one of the more evil of Kevin's personalities, has kidnapped three teens – Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) – and is holding them captive in his home.While Claire and Marcia are good friends, Casey is the wild-card in the pack: a moody and aloof teen that doesn't fit in with the crowd. We see the abduction unfold largely through her intelligent and analytical eyes, with her experiences causing flashbacks to hunting trips in the woods as a five-year-old child with her father and uncle.This is McAvoy's film, with his different personalities being very well observed and the scenes where he switches from one to the other being particularly impressive as piece of acting. Of the youngsters, Anya Taylor-Joy is the most impressive, with the denouement of her particular sub-plot being my favourite part of the film.Shyamalan, who also wrote the script, is treading a well worn cinematic path here (since often the MPD element is the surprise twist, to list any films here inevitably risks major spoilers). But this is a film that seems to have generated a lot of interest, particularly with a younger audience (I have seldom been quizzed more with the ""Ooh, have you seen this yet"" question). As a result this may be a modest sleeper hit.Where I think the movie missteps is in its casting of the three cute and scantily dressed teens as the abductees. From the plot of the film that emerges this appears to be unnecessary and exploitative, especially since they are made to progressively dis-robe as the film progresses. The film would actually have been made more interesting if a family unit, or at least a mixed variety of individuals, had been taken.Unfortunately Shyamalan also over-gilds the lily for the finale by going from medical improbability into outright science fiction: and dilutes what was up to that point a stylish thriller. As a result it's a decent popcorn film, and worth seeing for McAvoy's clever performance, but its not going to go down in my book as a classic.Watch out by the way for a nice final cameo scene: a clever reference to past glories.(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook).","

"billcr12","29 March 2017","James McAvoy is the only reason to watch Split. He is a man with 23 separate and distinct personalities. Three high school girls are abducted from a parking lot in a Pennsylvania town. Kevin(McAvoy) has placed them in a room and appears as a different person with each encounter, including one as a little boy. He also is a regular patient of a college professor, Dr. Fletcher(Betty Buckley), who not only treats him as a client, but uses him in lectures as an example of an extreme multiple personality disorder. The three victims are downright silly and the doctor clueless as to just how dangerous her pet project is to society. His means of financial support are never explained and how he is able to survive and live in some abandoned building with no one seeing him come and go is absurd. M. Night Shyamalan has left too many gaping plot holes here. He uses a flashback involving one of the girls as a small child in the woods with her father and uncle hunting deer. It makes no sense as to the rest of the story. McAvoy is riveting as he transitions from one personality to the next with both voice and body mannerisms that are uncanny. I was impressed with him previously in another movie from Scotland in 2013 which is fairly unknown, Filth. He is hilarious as a corrupt policeman and it is a better film then Split.","

DID is formed to protect the body when you experienced severe trauma in your childhood. the alters (the different personalities) will never ever psychically hurt other people. DID is a coping machinism. this movie makes people think that DID is dangerous and evil but its the total oppisite from that. as a person who has DID i just think it's really offensive and gives the wrong information which is really sad.","

"missjacquil","11 March 2017","Not too sure why this title was so highly rated. The synopsis really captivated me and I believe the potential of the movie was vast however, Split did not perform up to my expectations. The movie lacks substance and builds towards a supernatural ending of gore and violence.I like how the theme of abused is being highlighted, yet the movie does very little to build upon it. The possibility of humans having multiple personalities to enhance themselves is a fascinating topic but yet again, the movie did not portray it in a good light.","

"AndreVeasey","15 February 2018","I will start off by saying this film was in no way perfect. There were some instances where I wondered what will this all lead to. Many people I hear who dislike the film is because of the personalities being violent. To be honest, the only personalities that are shown to be somewhat violent is Dennis and The Beast. Dennis doesn't do anything violent either. As seen in this film the personalities were actually funny, kind, and artistic however there were events that lead to some personalities believing it what's known as The Beast. The acting by James McAvoy was excellent. The plot was probably the only thing that was a little confusing. This is a great thriller film with some flaws but its entertaining in which I believe the director did good. I'm not anticipating his next film as I am others but I'm interested in seeing his next film.","

"collegedude-37028","27 January 2017","Have you ever been captivated by a trailer and for months looked forward to the advertised film but then when you finally get to see it you are left underwhelmed and disappointed? Unfortunately, that's how I felt about Split, the newest ""thriller"" from director M. Night Shyamalan.I put the word thriller in quotes because I felt that it wasn't a thriller at all, but rather a drama with tense moments.Split tells two stories rather than just one and I think that's what hurt the film the most. The first story we have is Kevin, played by the brilliant James McAvoy, who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder. Kevin suffered a trauma in his past and his brain formed 23 different identities in order to protect itself and a new one is emerging on top of those. Out of the 24 total, we are only shown 8. The 8 that we do see are remarkably well-done and at times rather creepy. The other story we have is Casey, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, who is kidnapped along with her two friends Claire and Marcia and held in captivity by Kevin. We are shown plenty, if not too much, of Casey's past but very little of Kevin's. There's only one minor flashback that gives us a cryptic look at Kevin's childhood but we are given at least five flashbacks of Casey's life. Just to be clear, I'm glad we were shown what Casey's trauma was but I think it could have been approached better. We really didn't need scene after scene to show us that she was a victim. It would have been nice to see more of Kevin's backstory so that we could get a sense of why he is the way he is.James McAvoy's performance was outstanding. It's hard enough to train yourself to embody one character for a role but to embody 8 is something not many can do. If there is a sequel, which I'm sure there will be, I look forward to seeing some of the other identities. Anya also gave an outstanding performance, perfectly displaying what it's like to carry a burden that you feel you can't share with anyone else, not even your closest friends.In conclusion, I feel that the film could have been done better. It was decent, but it wasn't shocking or terrifying like the trailer claims. I will say that the ending is surprising; not a plot twist that so many have claimed it to be, but rather withheld information that has come to light in an intriguing way. I give Split 2 out of 4.","

"LuxuriousWoman","13 March 2017","This was an interesting concept, but writing ruined it. You have a guide with mental illness that caused him to have 23 different personalities. An interesting thing is that people with multiple personalities were able to change their body chemistry. Only one of the personalities needed to take shots, and the strength varied with each personality.The three girls are captured and put in his dungeon like thing. They are constantly trying to think of ways to escape, while the guy is worried about keeping them there and going to his therapy sessions. His therapist is fascinated with how they can change their body chemistry and she wants to keep an eye on him.It sounds so interesting! Then, where did it all go wrong?The characters. The girls are dumb and make many mistakes. They should have teamed up to jump him, but they never think of that. They find a secret way out, only for him to capture the girl that got out and separate her and boarding up the exit. The black girl, or mixed, hit him with a chair and tried to escape only to be captured and separated. Now they are all split up and can't plan together because they didn't work together.The main girl, Kasey/Casey/whatever, ended up tricking his 9 year old personality and called the front desk. She told the guy that she was kidnapped with her friends and the guy though it was a prank. Really? Who would prank someone like that? Also, shouldn't you check just in case it isn't a prank?The main Kasey girl finds a screw and gets out one room that way, but she's in another room that's locked. Kevin's (the main guy) therapist notices something is up and meets up with him. She meets up and excuses herself to use the restroom. She checks a room and sees a kidnapped girl there. Instead of calling the police, she stares in shock and it's enough for Keven to knock her out and put her on the couch. What a failure! The blond one gets inspiration and looks around the room for something to get them out. Shouldn't y'all have done that before? Anyway, the black girl finds a hanger and tries to unlock it from the outside instead of picking the lock. Why? Anyway, Kasey is trying to contact the outside world with his computer, but the internet doesn't work. She watches videos of his different personalities for no reason what so ever. She eventually gets something heavy and starts trying to break the door down. Wouldn't it be better to look for keys or something to pick the lock? Kevin, the main guy, is on a train when he activates the 24th personality, the beast. The beast is super fast and super strong and spells trouble. We go back to the girls and the black girl got the actual lock to the other side and she seems successful, but the beast is already back! The old lady gets back up, but her glasses are gone and she can't see. The best breaks her bones and goes to look for the other girls. Kasey gets the idea to remove the hat and we see the keys are there. Are you kidding me?! She unlocks the door and sees that the lady has been killed and her friends have been eaten. She says the guys full name, and he reverts back for a second, and she finds out that he has a shotgun. Her and the beast face off until the beast realizes that, like him, she has been abused as a child. He leaves her alone and the people rescue her. She gets picked up the the people and we see the guy she called, a black guy, make a face like, ""Oh crap! My bad!"" Yeah idiot, you got three people killed! I hope you're happy with yourself. The girl is to be picked up by her abusive uncle and it ends.This was the most infuriating movie. The black guy could have sent help as soon as he got the call, but he didn't. Now three people died and all he could do was make a ""Oh crap! My bad!"" face. The therapist should have called the police as soon as she saw the girl, but she just stood there. The keys where under the hat the whole time, and Kasey could have saved like 30 minutes by getting the keys. Heck, she could have saved the therapist and her friends by breaking them out 30 minutes early and getting help.","

"MrDHWong","12 April 2017","Split is a psychological thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and starring James McAvoy. While not a complete redemption for Shyamalan's filmmaking credit, it is certainly a step in the right direction.After attending a birthday party, three girls named Casey, Marcia, and Claire are kidnapped by a mysterious man identifying himself as ""Dennis"" (James McAvoy) and are held in a prison-like basement. While trying to escape, the girls discover that ""Dennis"" is actually one of 23 distinct personalities belonging to the man in question, and is conspiring with a fellow personality to aid in the release of a frightening 24th, known only as ""The Beast"".Suspenseful and often chilling, Split feels like a much needed return to form for the once disgraced writer/director. Shyamalan successfully channels the Hitchcockian method of storytelling that was present in his early films. As one would expect, there is a twist ending but unlike Shyamalan's recent duds, this one actually works quite well. James McAvoy gives a frightening, deranged performance as a man suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and he never overacts or hams up the unhinged nature of his character. Shyamalan still has a long way to go before he fully redeems himself of his recent terrible films but if Split is anything to go with, he's definitely on the right track.I rate it 7.5/10","

The girls try to figure away to escape, soon the guy has a personality disorder, and are scared if they are gonna get out alive.M. Night Shyamalan once again proves he's still got it after The Visit(2015), and now Split, James McAvoys performance really keeps you on edge, as an actor he really believes he is all these personalities, that is how an actor sometimes works cause if he doesn't believe it, then the audience won't either. Anya Taylor Joy is also great here, I believe one day we'll see an Oscar in her future. Betty Buckley(Carrie, Eight is Enough) is great has the doctor trying to help McAvoy. You may think it's a movie about a man with a personality disorder, but it becomes so much more than that. If you like a movie that will keep you on edge, then check Split out.If you are a fan of Shyamalans earlier work, then stay around towards the end, cause he puts one of his earlier films in the same universe with this film, which makes me excited for a sequel.","

"pannuage9","6 April 2017","Wish they had an option for zero votes, as this movie or film if you'd call it that, doesn't deserve the one vote I gave it. So, this guy M. Knight still puts out crap after all these years. Notice I use 'Knight'as I soon expect the Queen of England to be knighting this fellow with some accolades for his contribution film and motion picture innovation.The opening credits are compelling enough to make one think that there is some hope for film's success; as a lot of work was put into the credits, perhaps more so than the body of the film itself. My hopes were soon dashed after the movie feebly got underway after the bold credit telling us who the director was of this fine piece of nonsense.I found myself (more or less tortured) thinking that the movie should get better and that I for once could write something nice to say about this movie and director. Maybe the guy could learn from his past work and improve with his latest artistic foray. But unfortunately that wasn't the case. As this so called movie has finally taught me never to view another Sham-o-lame movie. Oh we, could all say give the guy a break, he's just trying to be artsy- fartsy what have you. But no, it's not even artsy-fartsy. Poor Mr. McAvoy, his talents seem denigrated after this and it could spell doom and career suicide as well after working with M. knight. I'm surprised that IMDb number is at 7.4 of 10. Wow... Stunning revelation to the capacity of integrity of movie enthusiasts.Yep, they had to bring in Bruce Willis in at the end for some box office draw like some insurance in case the movie severely bombed, which surprisingly it didn't as the box office business indicates $137 million netted from an estimated $9 million production budget. It just means that we'll see some future crap from this guy.I understand that devout fans of M. Knight may be incensed with my comments but after all, opinions are much like orifices, as everyone is born with one or more. Enlighten me if I've missed something as I've gotten nothing from this film except for an 'itch' around the groin.A final word of advice, save your money and more so, your time on this one as you will wish you had after self-debasing yourself with this latest attempt of tom foolery.","

The premise that a person who suffers from such a condition means he can instantly become a cold-blooded killer is FALSE! In fact, in reality, almost all people who have DID are harmless and suffer inside themselves because of the illness and try to conceal it from the rest of the world so that people won't look at them with bad eyes (it's what they fear most and live with this fear always!). This movie is a great bullshit and offense to all the people ailing from mental illness (especially DID in this case). IT""S A DISCRIMINATION AND AFFRONT to them!!

"Vivekmaru45","12 April 2017","I am giving the film a rating of 3 because I have seen two good films by M. Night Shyamalan mainly The Sixth Sense 1999 and Unbreakable 2000. You should add these two films in your movie collection.This film starts off with the abduction of three teenage girls Claire, Marcia, and Casey by an unknown young man(James McAvoy). This man later on, exhibits symptoms of multiple personality disorder towards the young girls. They in turn are scared out of their wits and devise futile attempts at escape, all of which are thwarted. The central character of this film is Wendell Crumb(James McAvoy) who exhibits 23 distinct personalities. There is also a hidden 24th personality which is in fact a demonic entity called ""The Beast"". Wendell has kidnapped these three girls in order that they be sacrificed to The Beast.Though the plot of the film sounds interesting the execution of the film is not. I am a keen horror fan but this film failed to hold my attention. I have seen many good horror films in my life and I can safely say that this film is not among them. You can compare Sixth Sense and Unbreakable which have coherent plots. Mind well that Shyamalan has directed many other films - but I have singled out these two as being his best works. I also want to add the Shyamalan is not in the same league as horror writers Stephen King and Clive Barker.I know that James McAvoy is a thoroughly professional actor, but he has succeeded at making a mockery of all the characters he has portrayed in this film. Just compare the acting of Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence Of The Lambs(1991) and Edward Norton as Aaron in Primal Fear(1996). Other good performances by Mark Harmon as Ted Bundy The Deliberate Stranger (1986), Michael Rooker in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986), Brian Dennehy as John Wayne Gacy in To Catch a Killer (1992) and Billy Bob Thornton as Karl in Sling Blade (1996).

"jeannefrancoise","12 March 2017","Okay so this movie is directed by Shyamalan, the director of some popular horror movies. He is specialized to make audience freaking out. Well in his new movie, Split, Shyamalan tries to combine the sci-fi horror and psychology issue. It is said that the main character here, Kevin, has 23 distinct personalities, from the kindest one, the woman, the sincere child, and so on. But there will be 24th personality about to produce. At first, audience already knew that Kevin is the main character because since beginning he leads the plot. What makes this movie good is that the effects and the places, so dark, so underground, and so ""horror"" with the fringe musics that you could imagine. For me, the plot is quite predictable, but the great acting of James McAvoy will keep your mouth shut up and you will close your eyes in some dramatic scenes that will give you a nightmare if the 24th personality is real in the real life. So that, I appreciate this movie as the new method to explain a psychopath, not just because he/she has bad childhood, but also to see the relation between human and their mind, how they make everything happen beyond logic and how they react it to other people. This horror is not just a horror, but a sci fi also. You watch it first and you will agree with me. Good job, McAvoy!!","

James McAvoy stepped on my radar with this one. Of course, previously I saw him in Narnia and in the X-Men movies but neither Mr. Tumnus nor Charles Xavier couldn't convince me whether he is a keeper or not. Now, I have 24 reasons to rave about his talent on this platform, too. He became wanted as my future cast member, that's for sure. His facial expressions and his eyes have no limits. His voices and gestures are literally giving you the chills. In the best possible ways, naturally.I wasn't a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work until Split came out. He caught my attention with Unbreakable but I was waiting for something more of my kind to appear. His way of telling stories is like an outsider. He is a witness. But with Split and Glass, he has entered the arena of the wicked. He's playing on our field now.This is a 10 star film, no doubt. From every angle it is a masterpiece. Epic soundtrack by West Thordson! I've been listening to it ever since when I need inspiration to write out one of the dark feathers.Have to mention Anya Taylor-Joy's acting debue in my world, too. She is one actress to look out for! I love her face and the ease she can transform. One of my weaknesses when it comes to choose a cast member.","

The whole story is a pointless mess, the story is thinner than Kate Moss and is utterly boring from start to finish, not to mention outright predictable. Probably what is the worst thing though, is that they use mental illness as a plot point to scare people, these people are not monsters and are not to be looked at like freaks, it is a severe condition which this film simply sticks the finger to. I've just about had enough of these modern 'thrillers' where the hell are the modern terminators, the blade runners, aliens, Indiana Jones?

If the film would be as exciting or gripping with a less convincing central performance is a moot point; but Shyamalan is certainly in better control of his ideas than he is in his weaker films. We've really got to start doing better, however, than using mental health problems as horror movie shorthand. This film does at least try to do something a little more complex in that regard, but it's still not enough to move beyond 'ill people as scary boogeyman'. It all does just about hang together in a final act that threatens the wrong sort of chaos but never quite delivers it.","

The ratings completely deluded me.
Anyway the movie really never lived up to the premise it builds up. I thought the flashback and the psychiatrist will somehow link to the main story but nothing happens.All the time the director gives a feel as if Casey already knows the man but she doesn't so why is she not helping others to escape. Seriously three people with the kind of stuff lying around could have overcome this guy but Casey never seems to even try.
You wonder if ""Sixth Sense"" was somebody else's idea because nothing after that by Shyamalan has lived up to that. ""The Village"" was also mentioned by Indian writer as a local story Shyamalan had picked up.","

"lmcressia","18 September 2017","The movie wasn't bad, per se. If it was just a movie directed by Average Joe and if the bad guy wasn't superhuman it would probably have been a fine movie. This movie is highly regarded, and I know at least part of my less glowing viewpoint is my expectations.1. M. Night Shyamalan. For some reason I keep expecting amazing things from him. Partially because of The Sixth Sense, and partially because I like the topics he writes about. The Sixth Sense was amazing. I enjoyed Unbreakable a lot more than I probably should have, because of its theme. I think it probably is not nearly as good as I believe it to be. Signs. A very popular film, which made no sense. I read an interview where Shyamalan belittles the reporter for not reading between the lines with Signs, and for taking it at face value. Well, ""M"", if you had written it better perhaps people wouldn't be confused about what was going on. I have not watched it again since reading the article, so it may improve my opinion of the movie -- it would almost have to. The Village. This movie was awful. dreadful. unwatchable. Please, do not watch this movie. 2. Twists. I expect twists from all his movies. This may not be fair, although apparently they all have twists, they are just often so obscure no one notices them. Apparently Signs had a twist. I will have to watch again to see if it really is. The Village had a twist, although I knew what it was after a mere 4 minutes, which made the rest of the movie hard to watch. I kept hoping I would be wrong and something interesting would be going on. But that was not the case. Split may have had two twists. 1. The main character is a ""cutter"". That's not much of a twist, and the word on the street is that wasn't the main twist. The main twist was the last scene setting up an Unbreakable/Split sequel. Twist. That's not actually a twist... that's just a thing that happened. The movies was entertaining and suspenseful. The characters were interesting. But ""The Horde's"" metamorphosis is a little much to handle. And most everyone being killed was a little more sad than it needed to be. Perhaps I misunderstood what was going on, for which I expecting a condescending note from Shyamalan, but did they send the main character back to an abusive relationship with her uncle at the end? Did that really happen? Did she go from one monster to another? That is a hideous ending. Did I get that right? I hope not, but that what it seemed like.","

"nazgul-15776","15 February 2017","Usually horror movies don't get this high rating unless it is really 
 original so I was very skeptical when I saw this movie has 7.5 ..and I 
 was right !!! .... this movie could have ended in 5 minutes. 3 girls 
 facing an average size unarmed guy with mental illness but they decided 
 to do nothing ... not even a punch or a kick but only crying. The room 
 they were locked in had many things which could have been used as a 
 weapon ... i.e the shower curtain rod, the sink, or even their shoes 
 which one of them used to dig a hole in the ceiling, but of course 
 not... also none of them thought of hiding behind the door and attack 
 him from behind when he opens it. Indian movies usually are long and I 
 guess Mr.Shyamalan could not forget his origins, so he tried his best 
 to extend his 5 mins story to almost 2 hours movie. Save your time and 
 money and go stare at an empty wall which will be more exciting than 
 watching this garbage.","

"Prismark10","8 April 2017","M Night Shyamalan's Split starts with three teenage girls being kidnapped by Kevin (James McAvoy) who traps them in a dungeon of some kind. The girls do plot to escape but get caught, they discover that Kevin has multiple personalities although only a few tend to emerge more regularly. However Kevin seems to be on the verge of the creation of a more beastlier manifestation.One of the kidnapped girl's Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) seems to be more competent with her survivalist instincts due to how she was bought up which we find out in flashbacks. Meanwhile Kevin has been in the care of a renowned psychiatrist who seems to be concerned about him and investigates further.Shyamalan hints at a universe shown in his previous film Unbreakable, where a person could elevate to a different level of being. He is helped by a stellar performance by McAvoy who does struggle to show all 23 personalities.In its heart though it is still 'girls that are kidnapped and held in a dungeon film' and frankly they tend to be two a penny in any given month. Despite the split personality gimmick the film was not that innovative or interesting and derivative of films like Silence of the Lambs.","

It kind of felt like a Freshman in a high school drama class wrote this movie and it was it first attempt at a movie. There wasn't any great twist or surprise that you find yourself waiting on the entire movie. Everything was as it appeared and that made for a lot of disappointment. The last 20 seconds of the movie did give me hope that if there's a sequel, it will be much better. As for this one.. if you see it on a late night cable station or Netflix, it is mildly entertaining but don't pay money for this at the theater. You'll likely be sorry you did.","

"lee_eisenberg","30 April 2017","M. Night Shyamalan made a splash in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense"", but aside from ""Unbreakable"", most of his movies since then haven't been anything to brag about (""The Happening"" would've been perfect for ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""). ""Split"" turns out to be a pretty interesting movie, as James McAvoy's character - suffering from dissociative personality disorder - holds three teenage girls hostage and they meet his multiple personalities.I'm not a psychologist, so I can neither confirm nor refute the movie's depiction of the main character. But I did like what the psychologist (Betty Buckley, who played the gym teacher in the original ""Carrie"") said. I wonder if this will interest more people in the topic. Whether or not it does, I still find this to be Shyamalan's most interesting movie of the past decade. And there just might be a little surprise at the end.","

"Troy_Campbell","1 February 2017","The double whammy of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable saw filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan ascend to the throne as the master of twists. Yet after delivering a string of debacles (The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth) his title was lost, seemingly forever. Thanks to a career shakeup—involving collaboration with super successful low-budget producer Jason Blumhouse (Paranormal Activity, The Purge)—Shyamalan has announced his return to form with this creepy psychological thriller. Creating an atmosphere of dread via constant tension building and a genuinely unpredictable narrative, Shyamalan is back to his old tricks of misdirection, rug-pulling and Kafka-esque storytelling. Opening with the kidnapping of three teenage girls in an utterly unnerving sequence, the tale unravels to explore the complicated lives of both abductee Casey (Anna Taylor Joy) and split-personality abductor Kevin (James McAvoy). Or is it Barry? Or Patricia? Chewing the scenery with aplomb, McAvoy delights in a role that allows him to segue between an obsessive compulsive weirdo, a frightfully stern mother-figure, a whimsical (and hilarious) 9 year old, and, in the final act, something else entirely. There are undoubtedly flaws—an underwhelming and frustratingly ambiguous climax for example—in addition to a few nonsensical genre tropes, but the film's tempo and energy diminishes the negative effects of these missteps. Possibly a transcendent movie short of regaining his old position amongst Hollywood royalty, Split is nevertheless an exciting and gratifying thriller that continues the Shyamalanaissance.","

Apparently we only use 10% of our brain if we could harness the rest I believe anything is possible.

"harry_tk_yung","22 January 2017","A psychopath (term used in a very general and imprecise sense) kidnapping a bunch of girls is a not a novel plot. Morgan Freeman's ""Kiss the girls"" (1997) is one that comes to mind right away. But while in that movie there is only one kidnapper, here in ""Split"", there are 23, as if you still haven't heard, occupying the same body. But obviously, we will not be shown all of them. In addition to the original personality that had suffered certain childhood tremor, we see a woman, a 9-year old child, an assertive schemer, an artistic homosexual and ""the beast"", among others.Ever since ""Sixth sense"" (1999) Night M. Night Shyamalan has made numerous attempts but has not been able to repeat that feat. ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" all had something to offer in the department of finale twist, although a far cry from ""Sixth sense"". ""Lady in the water"" is a let-down. Personally, I like ""The happening"" although I am quite aware that this view is not generally shared. ""The Last Airbender"" appeared to be his final abandonment of his signature genre and hence a total disappointment. I am therefore delighted to see that there is a certain degree of his return to form in ""Split"", in masterful handling of thrill and suspense, even if not in devising clever twists.""Split"" is not a convoluted contrivance. The narrative is orderly, told essentially through omniscient narration granted the audience via the POV of a number of characters.The motive for the kidnapping is not entirely clear. Two have been offered. On a simpler plain, one of the 23 personalities enjoys watching sexy girls dancing. On a subtler plain, everything is under the ultimate control of ""the beast"" who wants to collect innocent girls who have never seen any vicissitudes for some ominous, dark purposes. The three kidnapped is just a start.After Anthony Perkins, James McAvoy is arguably among the best actors in this generation to play this multi-split-personality protagonist. This he has demonstrated convincingly, switching seamlessly from one personality to another right under the unforgiving scrutiny of the close-up camera. Anya Taylor-Joy, in what is closest to the lead female role here, shows her worth acting opposite McAvoy. Playing the kidnapped girl who had a childhood tremor just as bad as the protagonist's, Taylor-Joy captures the audience's imagination in a scene with a devious attempt to trick the 9-year-old personality into helping them escape. Also excellent is Betty Buckley as the protagonist's doctor who is, among other things, a sort of surrogate VO explaining the details of his case. ""Split"" to-date has earned an average 7.7 score from IMDb users, as well as generally favourable critic reviews.","

"evetodew","22 October 2017","I usually don't watch trailers for movies, because I want to be surprised by what I will actually see. And I am glad I didn't read anything about the movie, or watched trailers or read reviews. So, my opinion is purely mine.I have to say that the movie totally got me by surprise. I was expecting something shallow and interesting, but instead, the story is much more complicated and deep, and could be seen again (which I plan to do with my husband). I think what touched me the most was the ending, when the Beast spoke to the girl in the prison cell, before he left her untouched.That moment really touched me because of my own difficult past, and I can relate to both characters. At times, when you think you are too broken, you need a bit of comfort that you are not a complete castaway from society, because certain things happened in your past, which were not in your control.I believe there will be people to relate to the characters just like I did, and will understand what I mean.A really powerful movie, at least for me!

They must be controlled by the Screen Actors Guild. First they removed all chat/discussion about films. Then they removed the ability to sort reviews by rating. Now they are actively giving random high ratings to films based on what hollywood needs people to believe.There was no point to this film and no point in making this film. It was slow, boring, ridiculous, annoying, and ultimately a stinker since the film itself loses in the end. I only watched it for the tie-in to the ""Unbreakable"" movies, but the only tie-in was a tiny scene during the credits where Bruce Willis mentions the name of the villain from ""Unbreakable""...that's it, just one word.

"arsenico71","17 May 2017","...which goes on about this movie. I liked it greatly. The suspense starts within a few minutes from the beginning, and never releases its grip until the final demise. The mean actor is absolutely great in his performance, playing 8 different personalities was not an easy task, and he did accomplish it with awesome skill. The setting of the story is totally creepy and perfectly fit for the character and the tale that is told, the soundtrack is carefully chosen to masterfully accompany the gloomy, sick atmosphere, and what about the story itself? It has a few minor flaws, but it works more than fine, and reading other reviews I notice that many didn't get important details. Casey's flashbacks, which many have deemed useless to the story, are instead a key element in the lunatic's final attitude towards her, and his seemingly unrealistic transformation (the most impressive one, I'm not going to say more in order not to spoil anything) is justified many times in the course of the movie by the description of how different personalities in one single person can have each their own physical peculiarities (such as illnesses etc.) which the others have not. Sure, the transformation itself a bit exaggerated, but the sense remains the same. And anyway, hey, it's a movie! You're expected to apply a certain amount of suspension of disbelief. Otherwise, just watch documentaries.As in just any horror/thriller movie, there's a few ""I-have-to-act- stupid-in-order-to-keep-the-movie-going"" moments, but those are to be expected, and don't take anything away from the enjoyment anyway.All in all, this is a very good movie in my opinion. If you like thick suspense and psychological twists, just watch it and you will enjoy it.","

"matthewssilverhammer","26 January 2017","Few directors inspire more intense reactions than Shyamalan. Starting out on the highest-of-highs (Sixth Sense) before steadily falling to the lowest-of-lows (Happening), his career wasn't so much a roller coaster as a log-flume-drop with seemingly no end. So while 2014's Visit was a nice rise back to quality, Split is a true return. A bold, original vision that hearkens his earlier work; a fascinating mixture of drama, horror and psychological world-building. Following the recent trend of ""kidnapped-and-trapped-with-a-crazy-man"" (10 Cloverfield Lane, Room), a trio of teenage girls are captured by a disturbed man (McAvoy) with 23 different split personalities. It's clear Shyamalan did extensive research, as the attention to and mentions of real-life disorder case studies is impressive. McAvoy's giant performance had every chance to be obnoxiously overacted, yet his commitment and intrigue ultimately wins each scene. His moments with his psycho-therapist are intuitive and curious, with an underpinning of unknown menace, as it all leads to an emotionally difficult message about handling and living with trauma. On top of all this, Split's ending surprise, a trademark of Shyamalan's, may be his best and most satisfying since The Sixth Sense. Still, even with all the good in Shyamalan's, he still has his hang-ups, many of which are on display here. For all the powerful horror visuals, ominously toned pacing, and humor that wonderfully walks the line between funny and disturbing, his direction makes the performances feel fairly unnatural, and his dialogue is sometimes oddly stilted and explicitly expositional. Despite the messiness and weak script moments, Split is an enveloping psychological thriller whose yarn is dutifully weaved with darkness and intrigue.","

Night Shyamalan was on top of the world comes Spilt, a film that's a great combo of dark, disrupted and humorous.James McAvoy plays a man with 23 personalities, but the movie only has room for 4 of the darkest personalizes that kidnap three teenage girls to implement a plan to lore in a new personality that will put them all on a new level.I wish I could say more, but it's one of theses situations where you don't have to be a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan just remember when his movies were top notch (You know before his head got too swollen with the village) In order to be real excited about the overall plot, an overall concept that's catered to Shyamalan's universe.But even without his well known twist, Split was a stunning movie that relied on the power of McAvoy's great acting. Well worth seeing just to watch him go back and forth between these people.It's a well trigger exciting moment at the movies.","

"rockman182","4 April 2017","I was once a fan of M Night Shyamalan. I absolutely love The Village and Signs and feel he was on a fantastic creative run at one point. That ended when he made The Happening and then even worse, The Last Airbender. I thought The Visit was a nice reminder that he could bring forth an entertainingly thrilling film. I was hoping Split would give me the satisfaction of being comparable to M Nights' glory days but I am sad to say I am disappointed.The film is about three teenage girls who are unexpectedly kidnapped in a parking lot by a mentally ill man with dissociative identity disorder. He has 23 different personalities and a 24th called the beast which seems to be the most threatening of them all. The hype for this one seemed to be real and I heard many raving about it but I didn't have fun during this film.I know many won't agree with some of my criticisms but I wish I could have liked this more.First of all the film should have been shorter. There were areas of the film that dragged. M Night was trying to build tense moments , a lot of which I felt fell short and were worn out. I have a background in psychology and know of dissociative identity disorder but am certain that a lot of the elements of it were fantastical. Too many personalities and that final form stuff just doesn't gel well and borders on silly. Not to mention the shift between characters feels incoherent at times. Saying all that I have to say that James McAvoy is absolutely superb in this. Like so alluringly good. I'm glad an actor of his caliber was able to showcase his range and ability although I wish the film was written better.The transpiring of some of the events were so stupid. There are a few plot holes but I couldn't ever really sit back and enjoy the film. The three actresses did a decent job, Anya Taylor-Joy will certainly become a big name but I have a hard time getting over the implausibility and the buildup to the final act. I don't want to say anything that will spoil it for other viewers but the ending is pretty cool and a nice callback to a time where M Night was on top of his craft.6/10","

McAvoy shows the world what acting is like, by breathing a unique personality into each and every one of them his character possesses. From the inflection of his voice, to the accent, right down to the body language, you recognize each personality with ease. The most fierce of his personalities is known as the beast, and the beast enjoys killing. Central to the story is the three young women that are captured and held hostage awaiting the beast to come and destroy them.This movie is very much a thinking man's movie, with a superhero/villain subplot.

With an epidemic of cutting by teenagers in our society, this remark was to say the least, troubling. As a therapist, I was appalled by Betty Buckley's character visiting her client at his home and then making the statement that ""her patients were her family"". If you're going to portray a therapist in a movie, that profession's code of conduct needs to be represented correctly. Parts of this movie were so unrealistic that I was unable to focus on the rest of the film. Another disappointment by M. Night Shyamalan.","

"kikoydaba3","26 August 2019","Impressive performances from James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy carry Split in a thrilling film about a psychopathic killer and childhood trauma.Split revolves around two main characters, Kevin and Casey, who suffer from childhood trauma which the film explores. Kevin developed his multiple personalities to cope from abuse by his mother and loss of father. He abducts three young women which includes Marcia and Claire. The film gradually reveals that the multiple personalities are distinct and fight for each others turn on ""the light"". The narrative is further driven by a yet not shown 24th personality, named the Beast, who commanded the other personalities to abduct the women as his food. Casey being abducted is designed for her to grow from the trauma caused by the sexual abuse by her uncle which is revealed through flashback scenes. Another subplot is Dr. Fletcher's, played by Betty Buckley, attempt to heal Kevin.The arc or Dr. Fletcher trying to heal Kevin bogged down the pacing which should have been strictly focused on Kevin and Casey. Scenes with an adult Casey and her uncle implying continued abuse should have been presented, not just on her childhood experiences. A clear resolution to both Kevin and Casey is not fully grasped because their trauma is different. Kevin is shown to be abused, but is not shown specifically how. For Casey, her ending should have been a proper breakup with her uncle signifying character growth. The camera work is impressive in some shots but not all. Angles are good but not the lighting which takes away some of the claustrophobic feel of the film.Nevertheless, McAvoy and Taylor-Joy are spectacular and carry the film on acting alone. McAvoy's personality switching is fluid and shows his ability to be a chameleon. Taylor-Joy is able to portray a layered performance simultaneously dealing with sexual abuse and the possibility of reoccurring in another form.7/10","

I don't understand. In their eyes Manoj can't do anything right anymore. So their judgment is already made based on the director. That does not make any sense. Manoj said in an interview that some people don't like his signature by being a small part of his own movies as an actor. That is what I do like about him. Why would the suit fit Stan Lee and not Manoj? Manoj makes me proud to be an Indian and writer of a thriller novel as well.Split is a very thrilling movie. I was on the edge of my seat all the time. I did not want to miss a second of the movie. The end scene was amazing. The acting of McAvoy is phenomenal. The script is not predictable. This is a worthy movie in the resume of Manoj.

"lesleyharris30","24 February 2017","Split is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a very tense, thrilling film as we follow three girls who have been kidnapped by a man with a serious case of schizophrenia. It kept me at the edge of my seat throughout as we follow these girls struggling to escape and being forced to deal with his many different personalities.The only thing about the movie that did bother me a little was false advertising. It was marketed that this man had 23 personalities and that he was unleashing his 24th. However, we only ever meet eight of them, so it is simply a disappointment for the audience who were expecting three times more than that. I understand that Shyamalan has plans to bring this character back, but it still should not have been advertised as such. Although, I must say, you do not walk out feeling underwhelmed by the amount of characters James McAvoy transforms in to throughout. He is phenomenal in this role, delivering each character with clear, specific detail. He blew my mind in every part, playing a convincing nine year old boy, woman and even an animal. There was nothing pantomime about his performances, he lets out a presence that truly becomes these characters, no acting, simply being. It is a very intense ride, one of M. Night Shyamalan's best work in years. Edge of your seat suspense and ridiculously well acted, Split is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good thriller. Three girls must try and escape the clutches of a deranged man who has multiple personalities. Best Performance: James McAvoy","

"ikanser","4 February 2017","OK, here is my honest review of this movie without any spoilers. A man with multiple personality disorder kidnaps 3 teenage girls. You can get that from the trailers. So then what happens? Personally, I thought the movie was too slow. I felt as if the movie never really took off. At times it felt like it would really take you somewhere but it just never did. The best part of this movie was the acting by James McAvoy. If you are a fan of his work, you will be blown away in this movie. And also the three teenage girls are really cute, and the director makes sure they get plenty of screen time. The plot is OK. The setting of the movie is OK. The movie itself is OK. This is an OK, 5 out of 10 movie. If you are a fan of M. Night then you will love this movie because that is the kind of movie you like. I wanted so much more but got left with this empty feeling as if I am still somewhat waiting for this movie to begin..","

"duckyisabelle","22 January 2017","I have to admit the concept behind this film hooked me but everything went downhill once it started playing in the cinema. From the horrendous, laughable acting by the three female victims (I often found it hard to believe the three of them were supposed to be terrified prisoners with their perfect makeup and unrealistic screaming scenes) to the obligatory 'plot twist' at the end, I felt like walking out of the theater multiple times during the movie. The only scenes which redeemed the movie were the interesting exchanges between 'Kevin' and the psychologist (props to the both of them for their decent performances) and I couldn't help cringing each time one of the girls made an appearance. It was sad the three of them had as much screen time as they had.Also, DID is a serious issue and yet, Kevin's dialogue was often cringe-worthy, prompting hysterical laughter from people in the cinema. It made it hard for me to think of this movie seriously. Even when Kevin finally transformed into the Beast and began crawling on walls, I was so numb from all the cringe-worthy dialogue and weak plot that I was no longer shocked at this entirely unrealistic 'plot twist'. Perhpas, James McAvoy should have just stuck to playing Charles Xavier if he wanted to be a superhero that badly.","

"Rayve777","22 August 2023","Split is a really great movie, such a breath of fresh air from the sea of inconsistent, infuriating mediocrity that has plagued Shyamalan since Signs. While everyone's acting is quite great throughout, James McAvoy easily steals the show, being able to effortlesslessly making them all feel believable in the same performance.The cinematography is excellent as well, portraying the claustrophobia that the 3 captive girls feel as well as revealing information to the audience about DID sufferer Kevin in clever ways.The theme of how trauma is passed down from childhood abuse and how it affects our behavior as adults I feel will be no doubt controversial to anyone watching Split, but I believe that Shyamalan handles this very sensitive topic with care and tact. Both Kevin and Casey, one of his captives, suffered from intense childhood abuse which shaped some antisocial behavior in them later on in life, but what separates them from each other is that Casey tries to help the other captives survive and escape. Kevin (or rather Kevin's other personalities), however, embraces the philosophy of ""The Beast"", who believes that those who have not suffered like he has are ""impure"" and must be purged from the world.Split proves that Shyamalan can easily still make films that are both thought-provoking and high quality, and it's for films like these that I still root for him and want to see him succeed.","

"eternaltranzitions","9 February 2017","This movie is just plain awful! I went to see hoping that it would be an intense thriller, however it was anything but that. It started off well initially but then turned into a slow, boring and drawn-out movie without substance. The worst part of this movie was its ending.I have never been a fan of M. Night Shyamalan but I thought this movie would be different given the fact that it is advertised as a thriller. I completely regret wasting 2 hours of my life and money on this pathetic movie and I would really like others to save their time and money. DO NOT be fooled but the intense trailers for this movie.

"senechs","28 November 2022","The cast is fabulous. They make up for many of the faults in this film. James Macavoy acts his behind off. Anya Taylor Joy shows why she is all the rage right now.There's also lots of great supporting performances and basic filmmaking.However, these can't save the movie from its ludicrous plot. I spent a lot of time saying really? Are you serious? Shyamalan does what he does in most of his recent films - tries to make a nuanced project but then tries to dumb it down for the masses. Simply put, you can't have it both ways. The result is poor exposition and over explanation. He needs to trust his audience, not condescend to them.","

"lavatch","18 May 2017","The films of M. Night Shyamalan typically exploit the supernatural in order to develop a suspenseful story with well-rounded characters. Unfortunately, ""Split"" relies primarily on pop psychology to explore a troubled man's multiple personalities in what is called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). The wildly speculative case study in the film includes one personality type that should be placed in a cage and out of harm of any bystanders.The bystanders who come in the way of Kevin Wendell Crumb, who has a habit of ending his sentences with the expression ""etcetera.,"" are three young women who are improbably kidnapped and held hostage by Kevin, etc. The one character who is more interesting that all of the characters rolled into Kevin, etc. is the young loner Casey Cooke. As developed in lurid detail through flashbacks, little Casey was an abused child who has learned to cope with her pedophile tormentor, Uncle John. Her survival skills will be put to the test by Kevin, etc.A kindly psychiatrist (well performed by stage actress Betty Buckley) badly underestimates the capabilities of her patient. She deludes herself into believing that she has some control over the wide-ranging behavior of Kevin, etc. Her fatal mistake is to pay a visit to his home. The alert viewer will surely recognize that her fate is sealed when she arrives at his odd living quarters, which turn out to be the sub-basement of the Philadelphia zoo.SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: M. Night Shyamalan's original ending for the film appears as an outtake in the DVD version of ""Split."" Curiously, the director changed the ending because he felt the original version was too dark. The deleted scene was to have Kevin seated atop a building decrying how unfortunate it was that most people go about their lives in an un-split manner, as opposed his subjective realities of multiple personalities. But in a film that is so unpleasant from the outset, it was difficult to see how changing the final scene could possibly have made the film any less depressing than it already was.","

"deloudelouvain","25 April 2017","I really enjoyed watching this movie. James McAvoy does a brilliant job playing the different personalities he has. The main character suffers from Disociated Identity Disorder and has twenty three different personalities. You only get to see about eight different personalities but they are all great to watch and add the necessary suspense for this movie. Some personalities are harmless and others are dangerous, and that's what makes it interesting to watch because the girls that have been kidnapped try to figure out who they could trust to get out of their imprisonment. Anya Taylor-Joy does also a great job playing one of the kidnapped girls, while she had herself suffered of traumatic events in her life. Some reviewers will tell you that people that suffer from D.I.D. are not violent or whatever but it doesn't matter because they just don't get the point that this is a movie. It's not real folks, so get over it that not everything is accurate in a movie. I thought the movie was better then a lot of other movies in the same genre so it deserves a higher rating.","

"wackywhovian11","21 May 2017","Boring piece of crap. You'd think a film with a main character who has 23 personalities would be interesting...well it wasn't. Now I saw this film from Redbox for like a dollar so that's the best way to watch it.Another disappointment from M Night. Why does Hollywood keep giving this dude money to make movies? I swear and the film made what 137million at the Box Office? OMG their idiots why didn't they wait until Redbox save a buck.Anyway I thought this film was just lame and a waste of time. The acting wasn't very good. James McAvoy was okay I guess but if he should have developed the characters of the 23 personalities which we only saw 8 on screen a bit more instead of just changing his voice.Oh the main actress what was the point of her flashbacks in the film? They didn't mean anything or bring anything to the story. Oh the girls were idiots. They had so many opportunities to escapes on so many occasions but didn't use em because their DUMB. Being a girl I didn't feel bad for the girls. Okay if you watched the trailer this isn't a spoiler you see the two girls in the back texting on their phone not paying attention and the main girl in the front seat looking like a zombie not paying attention and the dude gets in the cars and they don't notice him until he puts on his mask. Umm if a dude is in your car in a mask you might want to scream or do something but they just say ""Excuse me I think you have the wrong car."" Umm ya think? Oh and the girl in the front seat she watches him spray the other girls in the face. Umm you could have ran away while he was doing that...idiot.Basically this film is junk. I'm always fooled by M Night's film The Visit, The Happening and The Visit just to name a few. Signs and Sixth Sense are ONLY best movie. I've stopped going to his films in theaters because I'm always disappointed except with Signs or Sixth Sense now those are great. And the whole Unbreakable thing who cares. I saw that film it was cool but to tie that film to this garbage was not needed.Should you watch this film. I guess if you really want to. But trust me when I say it was boring and a piece of crap. It's only a dollar and some change at Redbox so if you really really really want to see it, rent it. But you've been warn that it's not good at all.","

"chrichtonsworld","31 January 2017","The second film in a short while where M. Night Shyamalan successfully has managed to scare the living hell out of us. The previous being The Visit of course.Now I know that there have been quite a few thrillers that make use of the Dissociative identity disorder or multiple personality disorder (MPD) and that at this point there is very little that can be done to truly surprise you. But by god M. Night has succeeded in a way that will put you on the edge of your seat multiple times. Not all the time mind you since the film dials down a few notches a couple of times. And this could make it seem the film drags here and there. In hindsight though it was M. Night teaching us what a master of horror he truly can be since he plays around with the tension to keep your interest peaked. Trust me on this that even when some of the plot developments may appear predictable it goes into different directions entirely. Especially at the very end of the film since it gives us a twist that is so meta that it will make your head spin. Very daring and incredibly effective. It is like he is saying, I told you that I am still very much on top of my game. But aside from this, the film in itself is incredible brilliant. James McAvoy was having a blast and he shows us what an amazing actor he is by switching up personalities like it's nothing. Still I do have to remark that Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke made a good impression as well. I did not even recognize her as she also was in The Witch.Split is one of those movies that does a lot of things really good and has you singing praise right after. But of course there will always be people hating on this film just because Shyamalan is involved. He does tend to make films that require you to suspend disbelief and have somewhat of an imagination. Doesn't always mean you have to like or agree with his vision because I am pretty aware he can make terrible films as well. Still Split is certainly is one of his better ones and deserves to be watched by many. So go forth ladies and gentlemen and enjoy yourselves. I certainly did!","

But as his 24th personality Is starting to come through, the girls must try to escape before It's too late.""M. Night Shyamalan"" has no doubt had a rollercoaster of a career. I love and hate his films. This film goes In the love section though.The positivesThis film sends an Important message about suffering. This film In some ways relates to me. The main character of ""Casey"" Is relatable due to past experiences In my life and It's great how this film sends a message on how suffering Is how someone becomes a real human being. It's a great message to send through such a great concept. The dialogue of the film Is great. No line feels weird and out of place and In some ways It's quotable. The performances of this film Is amazing. ""James McAvoy"" gives not only a career best performance but also one of the best movie performances I've ever seen. Trying to play different characters Is hard and ""McAvoy"" knocks It out of the park. ""Anya Taylor-Joy"" Is amazing as always. The other actresses I've never heard of till this also won me over too. The films tone and atmosphere Is brilliant. From the first scene, you already feel the tension thanks to the camerawork. The camerawork throughout the film Is amazing. There's many long takes and great cinematography throughout the film which makes the film amazing to look at.The negativesThe only flaw I have Is the final scene. It Is a twist as always and I did not expect It. But It felt really forced. There was never really a need to continue this story as It ends on a satisfying note, but the twist just felt like tiring sequel bait.ConclusionApart from It's final scene, ""Split"" Is fantastic. It's amazing premise and writing, the message It sends, career best performances, a consistent creepy tone and amazing camerawork make this one of ""Shyamalan"" best movies.I'm going to give ""Split"" a:9/10.","

"massmordarskjorta","13 April 2017","I'm sorry, no. Not that I've ever called myself a fan of his work, but i thought M Night was supposed to be an A-list director. This film plays more like a 5th grader with film school ambitions who sent a script to Mr Shyamalan and it just got made. It's unoriginal, on the nose, and worst of all, boring. I realize there is a whole new audience of people out there and we can not keep raging on about old films, but when we have the Hannibal films and the magnificent series both with the character Francis Dolarhyde, a pretty recent The room and the immortal performance of Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman in American psycho, this just seems as a waste of time. Go watch previously named titles, hell, go watch Seven, and you'll be much better off. 2016 was a disaster of a year regarding films, this is no exception.","

"jasontheterrible","18 January 2017","One needs to be a fan of James McAvoy to fully enjoy this film which I am not. I also rarely watch films so absorbed with one primary actor or ""character(s)"" but this one did win me over. First of all the film score matched up well with the scenes adding the right evocation or emotion. It got better and better as the tension increased. The acting of McAvoy is engrossing, there is no doubt about it. The first half can be at times very grating as drama because the characters keep making wrong decisions. This usually puts me off of a film but it got me back during the last 30 minutes. The story and symbolism is reminiscent of ""Manhunter"" by Michael Mann which was re-made as ""Red Dragon."" Only this one by Shyamalan added quite an interesting new element which is actually supported by much literature. Some will think it borders on the esoteric but the lines are fuzzy. As far as the naysayers who invalidate MPD or DID there is very convincing data that the physical changes are immediate and not faked having been observed in many young children. The transformations are as real as spontaneous remission.My only criticism is the moral ambiguity. In the end losses come because of the superior and experienced, nuanced analysis of the sickness instead of immediate and hostile action. The losers were right about what should have been done from the very beginning.","

"moviexclusive","19 January 2017","If you've seen the trailer, you'll know the surprisingly clear premise of Split - the latest film from M. Night Shyamalan. A mysterious man kidnaps three girls and traps them in an unknown location. As they struggle to escape, it would seem that he has accomplices - except it turns out, ""they"" are him. It's all him.James McAvoy is Kevin, the kidnapper who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). We start the film when he is controlled by the stern and OCD-inflicted ""Dennis"", kidnapping Casey (Anya Taylor- Joy), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) for a mysterious reason, with his companion personalities, ""Ms Patricia"" and ""Hedwig"". Together, they are considered ""the Horde""; three of twenty-three personalities taking turns to be ""in the light"" inside Kevin. This only turns more disturbing, as words like ""The Beast"" and ""sacred food"" are whispered by the trio, and the girls, naturally panic-stricken, work towards finding their way out of their jail.It would seem that thirteen is a lucky number for Shyamalan. The 2015 The Visit was his return to form after a string of embarrassing work. He's always been a good explorer, asking what-ifs that turn subject matter on their heads, ending them with his signature plot twists. After realising this became his Achilles Heel, he has reinvented himself with a refreshed formula, and Split would reinforce that he is succeeding.With his latest film, he comes at you three ways - the obvious plot of the girls being abducted by a trio of cultish personas that wants to somehow use them to release ""the beast"". The second is Casey's story, that runs parallel in the form of flashbacks, slowly unfurling the reason behind this youth's unusual behaviour. This explains not only her aloof and uncooperative nature, but also her worldly and calculated maneuvers, relative to the other two girls who are more impulsive.It is the last that rattles the most, and it lies in the hands of both slayer and savior - the beast's doctrine that ""those who have not suffered are impure"" and Kevin's therapist, Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), who theorised that those suffering from DID are not lesser human beings with damaged minds, but evolved greater beings, with sometimes supernatural traits. Weaving these three arcs seamlessly into Split is a testament to Shyamalan's persistent skill.McAvoy is a notable actor, with enough fluidity to make for a fascinating Kevin. As ""Dennis"", he is sombre and uptight, crunching brows and fidgeting with object placements. ""Ms. Patricia"" comes along and he turns poised and deliberate, with arched eyebrows and tightened lips, holding back her delicious secrets. ""Hedwig"" is the attention-seeking nine-year-old, who we slowly find out has managed to steal ""the light"" from ""Barry"" - the usual benign controller of Kevin.McAvoy does an admirable job, shifting nuances between the personas. But maybe his recent appearances as the bald Charles Xavier has grown too ingrained, and Kevin's transformations, though laudable, are not as defined as they should be. And though interesting to watch, and sometimes terrifying to decipher (as to who's in charge), the mental patient he plays does feel cliché and a bit of a caricature. Maybe Joaquin Phoenix (Shyamalan's original choice) would have fared better? Unfortunately, we'll never know.Though the early scenes of escape were tense and exciting, the ones with Dr. Fletcher made for some of the most engaging watch. Although therapists are roles that tend to be relegated to help with exposition, Fletcher serves to be an equal and compassionate player in the hide-and-seek game, where she susses out who the controller might be. As she figures out that her theory might be more terrifying true than she expected, the audience follows her through her mortification.Anna Taylor-Joy was a riveting victim. Her startling fragility and angst as Casey gives the movie its most moving moments. Her quick- thinking and measured moves reveals a survivor honed by the past, and as we get fed her history, we become thankful for it, and yet in the most conflicted of ways. Her ending scene and that withering look has us knowing that she's in for more terrifying stories to run from, and proves to be the most disturbing takeaway of all.Shyamalan remains a great storyteller, reinforcing the main plot with small vignettes of charm and wit. In the scenes where ""Dennis"" masquerades as ""Barry"", he makes himself overly effete, and over- populates his speech with fashion trivia, when ""Barry"" was nothing like that, revealing stereotypes even among personas. In another snippet, as Fletcher shares her theory with her elderly neighbour, and calls her patients superior human beings, the old lady rejects her proposal, calling it rubbish, before picking up her phone having succumbed to an infomercial.Split is so many things, and served up by the skillful editing of Luke Clarrocchi and the magnificently atmospheric score by West Dylan Thordson which swings overhead like a metallic guillotine, explores and represents this old adage the best - whatever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.","

James McAvoy give us a brilliance and jaw-dropping performance as the highly disturbed man with a diagnosed 23 distinct personalities that the idea itself is so refreshing and intriguing to see after countless bad horror movie or sequels that no one ask.The character is so complex when he has to change personalities every time from a little kid to a man with OCD Symptoms to a nice middle age woman and finally The Beast.The idea may seem extreme and not convincing at all but seeing James facial expression,the way he talk or movement to match each character make me totally buying it.The rest of the cast did a very good job with the material their handle especially young actress Anya Taylor-Joy who one again impress me with the character Casey Cooke a lonely girl also have a disturbing past so her chemistry on screen with James McAvoy is so thrilling and interesting to watch.The part that i say too good is not only the shocking final part when she face off with The Beast but also the ballsy of director M. Night Shyamalan when he let the antagonist got away in the end leave a unsatisfied feeling in our heart then the confusing scene set up for the future movie with character David Dunn played by Bruce Willis","

"fredrikgunerius","11 August 2023","When M. Night Shyamalan has been at his most creative and fired on all cylinders, it has resulted in some of the most inspired thrillers of the past two decades: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs and The Village. In Split he is at it again, with a story that is as clever as it is preposterous, about a man with 23 different personalities, played with wonderful playfulness by James McAvoy. The first part of Split is also the best, as Shyamalan evokes an eerie atmosphere around the kidnapping of three teenage girls and the subsequent introduction of the kidnapper and his alter egos. Shyamalan demonstrates clever screenwriting as layer after layer of the onion is peeled and we get to know the McAvoy character more and more. Much of the key to understanding him comes through his scenes with Betty Buckley as his psychologist, and as in Shyamalan's best films, the tension and suspense rises to vibrating levels as we approach the turning point. Unfortunately, the film's effect is somewhat diminished by the realization of McAvoy's final personality, ""The Beast"", which could and should have been held on a tad more realistic level to avoid the cliched and largely ineffectual movie-monster-feel. Fans of Shyamalan may also like the cameo of Mr. Glass towards the end, with all the anticipation his appearance creates. Let's just hope the teaming of Kevin Wendell Crumb and Mr. Glass will become more fruitful than Superman vs. Batman.","

Kevin Wendell Crumb(James McAvoy) has 23 vastly different personalities, living inside him. One of these personalities, kidnap three girls namely, Casey Cooke(Anya Taylor-Joy), Claire Benoit(Haley Lu Richardson) & Marcia(Jessica Sula). Casey, Claire & Marcia have to figure out what Kevin wants with them & escape, before the appearance of a terrifying 24th personality. Split is a mind blowing film. Director M. Night Shyamalan delivers another unforgettable thriller, after The Visit(2015). Shyamalan's original script is one of a kind & maintains the suspense & tension, throughout the movie. You just cannot predict what Kevin is going to do next. The performances are the highlight of the film. James McAvoy has given the best performance of his career so far, as Dennis/Patricia/Hedwig/The Beast/Kevin Wendell Crumb/Barry/Orwell/Jade. McAvoy alters his speech, gait & mannerisms for each personality, with ease & panache. Not even one personality feels like a rehash of another. James McAvoy astoundingly portrays a man suffering from DID. Anya Taylor-Joy is spectacular as Casey Cooke. Betty Buckley is superb as Dr. Karen Fletcher. Haley Lu Richardson is great as Claire Benoit. Jessica Sula is brilliant as Marcia. Izzie Coffey is outstanding as Five-Year-Old Casey. Brad William Henke, Sebastian Arcelus & Neal Huff are impressive as Uncle John, Casey's Father & Mr. Benoit, respectively. Split is a must watch for psychological thriller fans. Also, I recommend everyone to watch it for its sheer unpredictability & the performance of a lifetime by James McAvoy.","

"RussHog","5 February 2017","Split is a strange movie - and one that probably is not entirely advertised appropriately - which may have led to some of the negative feedback. Split is not a horror film - it is more of a mystery thriller but it also a character study in the rise of an evil villain.The movie is about a man who has split personalities - and one of them may or may not be a supernatural force that seeks to unleash chaos. To find out of this supernatural force is real - he kidnaps three women and holds them in a secret chamber until the time is right to find out if his supernatural split personality can rise to devour them.The women are led by a brave heroine who has her own past that is shrouded in sorrow. For when she was a child her beloved father was killed and she was left alone with her uncle - who abused her. She once tried to kill the uncle - but she failed - and perhaps she owes the devil its due.These two character's are bound for a showdown where they will battle one another and find find the answers that they seek to link them to their destiny in life - and what some may have felt was a let down I was highly moved and thought the performance of both lead actors was fantastic. As was the directing in the final moments. There is a super cool plot twist in the very end that blew me away - that the movie takes place in M Night's Unbreakable universe - which is an old M Night movie about a man who discovers he is a real life superhero and the world is full of wicked villains he is destined to combat.Split is not a scary movie - and there are some really badly written scenes. Some of the exposition is textbook highly problematic - but the truth is that M Night can get away with some bad writing - because his name has proved to sell millions of dollars so I let him pass.","

It is one creepy, terrific, disturbing and dark ride from the beginning to the end of the movie. As we learn more and more about Kevin and some of his personalities it gets more and more complicated and it starts to get really dark. With constant mention of the Beast and some doubts about it which are beautifully given us by Kevin's psychiatrist Fletcher. Only Casey from those three girls has a real values to story and with flashbacks that were from beginning weird and seemed like something was off they towards end filled magnificently and gave a real power to story. From early age and abuse that Kevin experienced now he developed mechanisms to keep him from harm and some so evil and powerful that will blow our minds. Tension kept building up really fast and time has come to final act of the movie. It was insane how vision of Shyamalan went to screen. It was bloody, dark, terrific, horrible and very disturbing. All praise to James McAvoy for playing 9 characters out of 23 (24) and his brilliant performance as well as characters shifting scene which was mind blowing. Shyamalan creation has returned more powerful than ever and there is much to say to his creation of this beautiful story. 4/4SPOILER ALERT! Considering flashbacks it was quite fitting to have them in way that Night put them so he could not give us too many information but kept us wondering and trying to figure things out. Showing the Beast and it's power is pretty intense with some great capabilities for further development. As some other characters in Unbreakable universe this one feels really superior and dark. Cafe scene was such a great ending for the movie and it finally gave this movie a genre, place and power that it deserved.","

"PStyles","20 February 2018","Overall I enjoyed this film, despite it's flaws. The concept is very intriguing in my opinion and has a lot to offer from a story telling perspective. For the majority of the film I was captivated and invested in the character's wellbeing...until the end. This movie is a shining example of how an ending can diminish what was an otherwise enjoyable experience. I will start by saying that James McAvoy was brilliant in ""Split"". He has, over the years, proven his worth and this film is yet another notch in his belt. While the script is inconsistent at times, McAvoy carries the load with his protrayal of a young man suffering from split personality disorder (23 to be exact, and thus we are given the title ""Split""). The acting is definitely one of the bright spots of this film, and McAvoy does not disappoint; he delivers a truly memorable experience from start to finish. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well; I was especially impressed by the performance of Betty Buckley who plays the therapist of Mcavoy's character Kevin. With an interesting premise and good-to-great acting, what could have possibly went wrong? Well, M. Knight Shyamalan is what went wrong. While i'll give him credit for rising above his recent disasters (and lets be honest, he hasn't made a halfway decent film since ""The Village""), he again attempts to be a bit too clever with this one. The ""twist"", as it's become known as in his works, is downright terrible and threatens to derail the entire movie. In fact, the first time I watched this I did not like it because of this ""twist"". It wasn't until my second viewing that I was able to appreciate this movie for what it does well. While the climax of this film is pretty disappointing, the actual conclusion is somewhat interesting. For those who have seen Shyamalan's (good) films, you will know what I speak of when you reach the end. Many did not like this, but I found it to be a pretty cool conclusion. Watch for yourself to see what I mean.I originally rated this film a 5 simply for the disappointing aformentioned climax, but after a second viewing I have decided that it deserves a better score than just ""average"". You must suspend disbelief if you wish to truly enjoy this film, but that isn't uncommon in the movie world. While the climax of the film leaves much to be desired (as well as some of the over-arching plot), overall this is a solid thriller worth watching in my opinion. Kudos to M. Knight for making another film actually worth watching (and one that doesn't make the list for potential worst movies ever).","

"funnycommentor","7 August 2023","First of all, the plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and really innovative. The storyline was well-written and well-explained, even though it wasn't really simple. The characters were very interesting and so well-developed. The filming location of the movie was mainly, Inside Kevin's «cage». The casting was nice and their acting was perfect. It wasn't a very scary movie, however there were too many creepy and upsetting scenes. Also, the killcount wasn't really bloody and most kills were done off-screen. The opening scene was definitely unpredictable, really shocking and very promising. The ending scene was kinda unexpected and really intense. Overall, it was just a nice psychological/thriller movie, emotionally intense and I would probably recommend it to my friends.","

"andymaranam","20 January 2019","Just wonderful..no flaws and a joy to watch Mcavoy show his worth as the shy endearing Kevin and then some. Certainly an oscar worthy performance by jm in a year that gave the darkest hour, get out etc this i must say is one of the best films i hv seen in years. In an almost kubrick type fashion the cast is immaculate, fitting their roles too perfection ( other than the cameraman? ) that aside ;)A joy to watch as you get drawn into the different character's emotional rollercoaster while being gobsmacked by Mcavoys performance and a top shelf script. All in all ..A must watch!Bonus fact: the backdrop for this film is actually taken from the true story of the Cleveland abduction, of three girls being kept hostage in a similar manner, by the infamous serial killer Ariel Castro.","

"teekieteekybirdie","30 April 2023","Seriously, this movie made me laugh out loud! It was SO ridiculous it can pass as a really bad comedy film. If the intention was for it to be a thriller, or a horror movie, or creepy in any way or scary, sorry but the suspense was absent, nor was it creepy or scary or even entertaining in any way. Poorly betrays mental illness and split personality disorder in the most cheesy, false way possible. Any Psychologist/Psychiatrist can tell you this movie is way off in their apparent understanding and potrayal of split personality disorder.The girls who try to escape are not too bright, so it's no surprise they didn't get out, it's amazing the one manages to escape.Shaymalan, you disappoint me. I expected better.","

"bombersflyup","20 May 2018","Split is tedious and uneventful, thriller it ain't.So it's the second part of a trilogy after ""Unbreakable,"" with basically no connection other than the last minute or so with Bruce Willis sitting in a diner. That last minute was better than anything this film really had to offer. Anya Taylor-Joy had the only respectable performance, McAvoy was just annoying. I'm not a hater, I like Shyamalan's films, this one's just bad.","

"TheNonSmoker","1 November 2022","Foremost, the Movie is definitely not representing the real world D. I. D, and it should not.The movie takes multiple personality into the heights of total madness, only few mad racing, car chasing, blasting scenes it required to make full of its madness.The movie started in a quite interesting manner, but soon turned into foolishness, and till the end it turns into confused madness.The movie version of D. I. D is very similar to the concept of Ben10, it is not serious and the story goes like meeting the criteria of a kidnapper and a serial killer.In the end, I'm still confused about the ending, but ok. 3 stars.","

"jmvscotland","7 August 2017","I'm sure James McAvoy has the capacity to be a decent actor and I suppose it's possible that he might one day get a decent part to play in a decent movie with a decent script. But, this one wasn't it.To illustrate the point, I look back over some of the roles that J Mc has had in fairly recent times - ""The Disappearance Of Eleanor Rigby"" (he was terrible and the movie was crap), ""Filth"" (he was awful and the movie was even worse), ""Welcome To The Punch"" (he was woefully bad and the movie was worse still) and then this lot of crap, ""Split"". A schizophrenic with 23 different and distinct persona? I'm no Psychiatrist but really, give us a break!! And then we're supposed to believe that a being of flesh and blood with 23 persona can develop a 24th and then be not only super-humanly strong but also resistant to shotgun fire at point blank range. Seriously, where do they get these dumb-arse ideas from?2016 produced some wonderfully good movies but this was not one of them. It was dreadful and probably worse is the prospect of a sequel which was set up at the end of this lot of rubbish.Is it the situation that J Mc just hasn't yet had enough good performances to attract decent scripts? I think that might be the case.I'll just say for now, you could probably safely stay away from anything that he's in and be none the worse off. Or, to put it another way, stay away from any movie that J Mc is in and you won't miss a thing.JMV","

"dbryn","29 January 2017","I think the movie started out great. I was captivated, intrigued, and was curious when the so called 'twist' was going to happen. The problem I have with this movie started in about the final 30minutes. SPOILER ALERT - The stage has been set, we're in a 'real world' with 'rules'. From out of nowhere, we have an insane person transforming and climbing on walls, bending bars, and brushing off two shots from a shotgun. For me, interest just went out the window. I was intrigued that this could happen to anyone, but a choice was made to bring in the supernatural. OK, fine... I figured this was all some artsy metaphors and perhaps all of the multiple personalities belonged to the girl which was intriguing. In the final moments it is revealed this is not the case at all, and we're in fact in the same movie world as ""Unbreakable"" from 17 years ago. Really? That was the big clever twist? Tying a movie with so much potential to a 17yr old film that no one really cared about to begin with? Confusing the hell out of likely 70% of the audience with this seemingly random tie-in? I think Shyamalan failed here miserably. Why would you put in the effort to bring this together with another 'average at best' movie from so long ago? Hugely disappointed. This was not even remotely close to his best work.","

"neil-476","15 May 2018","Odd-girl-out Claire and two classmates are kidnapped by Kevin, host to multiple personalities. Can they escape, or enlist the help of one or more of McAvoy's personalities, before The Beast arrives. Does The Beast even exist?This claustrophobic suspense thriller clatters along very satisfactorily in its own right - the girls, held prisoner by someone who is clearly very wrong in the head, have to overcome tearful hysteria and try to find a way out of their predicament before the much-heralded Beast arrives, a story which has its own self-contained clock ticking away. The girls are pleasingly hysterical - Claire, who has her own secrets, less so - but turn their attentions to problem-solving, and you root for them to find a way out of the trap they are in. Shyamalan's writing here works well after a number of clunkers.Then we have to factor in James McAvoy's performance/s as 8 or so of the two dozen multiple personalities. If I am ruthlessly critical, a couple of those are a bit on the obvious side. However, given that these are by far the most entertaining personalities - the audience was laughing out loud at Hedwig's dancing - and that they contrast so well with their far more sinister confederates, I think this can be forgiven.This is McAvoy's film. He holds the screen effortlessly whenever he is in front of the camera, and much of the film's effectiveness comes from not knowing who he is going to be next.Which is not to dismiss the girls. All are excellent, but I continue to be excited by Anya Taylor-Joy: after The Witch and Morgan, this role is a departure which, again, suits the off-kilter intensity she projects so well.And the final throwaway scene was an utter delight.","

It's better to make a good distinction between five and eight. The plot was so messy that the hostess couldn't keep up with it. In short, it is ambitious, but not successful.","

It's a breath of fresh air to see something that isn't a remake first of all, but the storytelling and acting was fantastic. Besides the film's lead, I especially thought the woman who played the doctor did an amazing job. All in all, I base movies on entertainment value. Did it entertain? Yes! Was it fun? Yes! Should you see it without expectations? Yes! Others may disagree, but I also loved M. Night's last film ""The Visit."" Sure he has made a couple stink bombs, but these last couple films make up for it in my mind. He's still one of my favorite directors and I hope me makes many many more films to come :) Get that chip off your shoulder and have fun watching films, lighten up! Life's too short not to ;)","

"gbill-74877","9 February 2018","James McAvoy turns in a strong performance here, adding some nice touches to the various personalities of his character(s), and is probably the best thing this film has going for it. Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula, the three teenage girls he abducts at the beginning of the film, are all reasonably good as well, and pretty besides. Maybe too pretty, as their casting and the plot feel a bit packaged. I liked the back-story of abuse and implication of going from one beast to another, and the line ""the broken are the more evolved"", which will resonate with anyone who has suffered while growing up. M. Night Shyamalan is at least coherent in this movie, but in the end, he doesn't really add all that much to the genre. It all seems done before, and the one 'new' element, the 24th personality, wasn't all that interesting. I wasn't too jazzed about the concept of setting up the next film either. This is a run of the mill suspense film, which is a shame given McAvoy's performance.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","21 February 2018","With perhaps the most meta twist-ending of all time, this psychological thriller represents somewhat of a return to form for Shyamalan - a writer/director who's career declined so heavily that he managed to not only make two of the best films of all time but also two of the worst - and a platform for McAvoy to really stretch his acting chops with a fantastic performance that perforates the piece. 'Split (2017)' is a bit silly regardless of its retroactive narrative justifications and lacks confidence in a number of key places, leading to a few on-the-nose expository dumps and jarringly unnecessary flashbacks. Despite some downright dodgy dialogue, it still manages to be both entertaining and interesting throughout, even if it's final act is incredibly rushed and wraps itself up in a neat yet unsatisfying way that only serves to bait a sequel that, with Shyamalan not quite back to what he once was, will surely disappoint. 7/10","

"rgkarim","19 January 2017","No please not that, anything but that! This might be the screams you hear when another M. Night Shyamalan film rolls into theaters. The man who started out so strong, only to fall so far has tried his luck at horror once more in the featured film Split starring James McAvoy. Will a movie about split personalities kidnapping girls be the step he needs to climb back to top notch director, or will his movie be laughable at best? Robbie K here with yet another review, and as always I appreciate your reads. Let's get started!LIKE:  Creepy kind of horror  Decent plot to keep it interesting  Complex morals  James McAvoySummary: Fans of my reviews know creepy horror is better for me than jump scares, and Split is a prime example of spine-tingling chills. Shyamalan and his crew get incredible effects from such simple tactics, using isolation, subtle piano background music, and gradual information revelation to keep you in suspense. By using a believable human as the monster instead of some cheesy creature, the creeps are only further amplified by how horrible such a thing can be. But scares alone don't make a movie and Split does a decent job of crafting a tale to keep you hooked into the movie. While certainly not original, Split's plot is a culmination of smaller stories that detail the background info of a majority of our characters, helping to develop them in the short run time. All of these tales have a moral twist to it, but one story in particular raises an intriguing concept that may provide some food for thought, or at least an ethical dilemma for future talks. However, the piece de resistance is the leading actor James McAvoy who carries much of the movie. The man can play multiple personalities well, tweaking his mannerisms and dialogues in subtle ways to craft an entirely different identity. His talents, as well as the direction, kept all his characters in the realistic zone, which while creepy, also made engaging characters to grab on to. There are few actors to which I could see doing the spectacular job he did.DISLIKE:  Predictable Story  Trailer has shown much  Don't see all the personalities  Mixed on the endingSummary: Despite the story being very well-developed for a horror story, it also isn't the most unique either. Outside of the twenty-three-personality quirk, you can guess much of the backstory of each character and where the film is going by about the 30-minute mark. Part of the predictability can be attributed to the trailer revealing a lot of key details in the short collection of scenes, including the big revelation at the end. The trailer also harbors on the twenty-three personalities, but in reality, it's more like four with a few cameos from the others. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing (as too many personalities could be very sloppily done), it also was a wasted gimmick. What do I mean by this confusing statement? I mean, why make twenty-three, instead of say ten, or even five? What was the significance of twenty-three outside of a nickname if you weren't going to integrate all of them? This dislike comes from the trailer's focus on high number only to once again let it fizzle out. And as for the ending, it's a very open-ended finale that leaves a lot of questions up in the air. Perhaps the potential sequel will answer these components, but only time will tell. The VERDICT:Split, to my surprise, was much better than I thought and was a horror movie worthy of the franchise. If you are looking for realistic chills, a satisfying plot, and fantastic acting of someone with a mental health disorder then certainly check this movie out. In fact, in regards to the horror genre I would warrant this movie earns a trip to the theater. However, as a movie overall, it still has its shortcomings, especially in regards to the twenty-three-personality gimmick. Yet one thing is for certain, if Shyamalan can continue this trend he may fall back into the favorable director field once more. My scores are:Horror/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0","

"Red_Identity","10 May 2017","I've been going back and forth on whether I want to give this film a 6 or a 7. On one hand, it's way too long. It's 110 minutes and yet it feels even longer than that. It's also simply not as ""fun"" as I wanted it to be. Instead of not taking it self seriously at all, the film is way too solemn and serious for its own good. At the same time, however, I admire its willingness to be something more than a cheesy horror/thriller, as it is also highlighting the types of mental processes that can occur with this type of medical condition. It's also very well shot, with some nice, fluid camera-work. The acting is also solid, but it's James McAvoy who impresses the most. He is easily the biggest reason to see this. He gives it his all.","

Assuming audience and critics alike were just happy Shyamalan made an objectively good movie, I went in expecting a movie about on par with an average marvel movie. I was wrong. This movie is on par with the greatest that shyamalan has made. And that does mean something!Unfortunately he hasn't really followed up with creating another great film, but his previous two have been much better than say Airbender or The Happening.Of course the story was interesting and compelling. There was little doubt that Shyamalan would ever fail in that aspect. The editing and cinematography were pretty great. Though still not comparable to Unbreakable or Sixth Sense, it was definitely better than his lesser films. Acting was amazing. James Maccovoy deserved an Oscar and a half.Way to go M Night!","

"TaylorYee94","27 April 2022","First half is awesome, so convincing and psychologically intriguing. Suspense is there with the support of appropriate use of sound. Thumping sound is hidden in the score, making heart beat faster, and when Claire is trapped in the cabinet with resonating sound of her breathing and panting, audience feels trapped as well. McAvoy's performance of Dissociative Identity Disorder patient is skillful and powerful. However, what happened to the last half? Shyamalan throws away half of the work built for an hour and transforms genre from thriller & crime to sci-fi out of nowhere. ""The Beats"" went too far, and he is so human, talking too eloquently, intelligently, and philosophically. According to all the basis explained by Dr. Fletcher and described in the movie, it's understandable that he has superhuman strength and beats-like agility but changing body forms and surviving after two shots contradict the first half of what the director has been saying.* Split not only portrays Kevin's state of mind but also defines the style of this film. The main setting, Kevin's basement is split into respective rooms of different identities. When girls first wake up from unconsciousness, Casey is separated from other two, audience seeing symmetrical contrast. Bars are shown many times dividing rather whole one image such as the gate of hideout and the last confrontation between Kevin and Casey.","

"jlyandco","6 May 2017","Mr. Shyamalan's movie is both incredibly disappointing, and has taken ""artistic license"" to a whole new level... of disservice.While ""dissociation"" is very real, the current professional mental health community is only now beginning to address this VERY real, yet woefully understated, diagnosis.Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is, essentially, a more modern term for what used to be called ""Multiple Personality Disorder"". Our communities and prisons currently have an incredible number of people tormented by this horrendous disorder... which remains significantly misdiagnosed and untreated, caused in part, by simply experiencing a single, yet impactful, traumatic event.Want to become somewhat ""enlightened""? Do a simple Google search for a string like, ""dissociation split movie"", and you'll find an abundance of legitimate articles articulating the disservice that Mr. Shyamalan's movie is doing (or has done) to people affected by this disorder, as well as the Mental Health community, at large.If you have not yet seen this movie, I would strongly encourage you to avoid it!","

"stonedraim","3 June 2017","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Right into it; The way M. Night Shyamalan in a very clear way makes his way through the 23 different personalities into the showcase of the movie is more than great. All viewers should have a fair chance to take onto the contemplation of the ""different splits"". On his edge, Mr. Shyamalan is here. Enjoy!It seems as Mr. Shyamalan has taken several movies and stories as inspiration and made this his own. I find traces of ""Room"" and ""Cloverfield Lane 10"" On top of this, the hide and seek motion and emotion from different horror games grasps hold of the screen as the audience just can follow through the games of the 23 patients. Watch the game ""Alien Isolation"", ""Dead Space"" and ""Outlast""...As usual (speaking of let us say Signs, Unbreakable and The Village) the blend of a social oriented day to day basis along with a creeping disliking horror comes to surface as the time passes by within ""Split"". If you like a some what original movie with a tight script and story, then ""Split"" should be taken care of by you. Some of you will crumble into psychological elements now and then, just to be aware of yourself jumping high and.... scream?!One of biggest fear of modern society may be the new and yet to explore sides and spaces of the human mind. All the psychological aspects, all the dysfunctional aspects, all the borderline discussions and the realism of philosophy; ""Split"" combines that with fear and throws a vast heap of question marks along the entertainment to both comply and investigate. I am very impressed how this is handled. Look about 35 minutes into the movie.----- 41:30...hey.....it is M. Night Shyamalan himself behind the computer! ""I've got red socks... I've got blue socks too... etcetera..."" Is this review a little different and goes here and there...? Yes, it is. Can there be a 25th........? ""We are what we believe we are."" -----This movie evolves around very interesting and deep matters. Can a human mind through extreme ""measures"" or ""pure power"" change a human being physically? Can it be that a human that has traumatic and tragic episodes processed have a more vast conscious and become/be more of an evolved person? Is schizophrenia a psycho-social matter, or is it in some way ""a true distorted view"" formed by the mind and brain, physically? What if adrenaline by the form of the story behind Bruce Banner becoming an extremely strong human being (The Hulk) combined with schizophrenia can create ""something""/someone abnormal, as the beast in here.....? Can a person develop strong skills and behaviours from animal and form itself from there on into something else...?M. Night Shyamalan himself were ""bad mouthed"" from fans and media about being a some what of schizophrenic.... and here he answers all that with a whole movie. (Clap clap!) The woman in the movie has been sexual abused. Can that be that she comprehend dominating males to be ""monsters""... is that her perspective? The viewer gets to know her more and more... and, at the end.... why is the steel bar of the cell all of a sudden straight again...? Is the perspective in her mind?In a time where the neuropsychiatric world is more and more explored and ""combinations"" such as ADHD, ADD and so on is under the microscope, ""Split"" takes that social debate and twists it. Well done! Are the society labeling too harsh and being judgemental...?The ending is one of the most intelligent I have seen in a long, long time. Made the rate jump up a bit, actually... over 8,0. It starts about 1 hour and 50 minutes into the movie. The music, the timing... M. Night Shyamalan... Sixth sense, Unbreakable... Bruce Willis.... Mr. Glass..... it all came down to this. I shouted right out and felt my hands applaud... What an ending!Over to the movie as a product: - The production : An simple and pure production. In its narrow path of production, the horror elements become grotesque. Mr. Shyamalans way of letting the truth and authentic story come forward is right in place in ""Split"". M. Night Shyamalan has almost perfected his own style. - The actors : James McAvoy nails the part. He delivers both pure evil, manipulation and grief of some kind. A textbook example of schizophrenia; see about 40 minutes into ""Split"". The whole session is finalized with depth of an competent actor surrounded with expertise of M. Night Shyamalan. - Entertainment : The motion picture takes you on a roller coaster. Up...down...here and there... and inside out, if you let it. - Age : 15, due to strong psychological aspects, violence and blood.8,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 9 Brilliant and admirable 8 Excellent movie and a solid production)","

"cosmo_tiger","1 May 2017","""We are what we believe we are."" Casey (Taylor-Joy) and her friends are having a fun day hanging out and shopping, then they are kidnapped by a man (McAvoy) with 23 distinct personalities. While the girls are trying to find a way to escape the kidnapper is on the verge of releasing a 24th and even more dangerous personality. This is a movie that is just flat out tense and good. The movie isn't straight horror as much as psychological and disturbing. The movie itself is almost a must see, but the real reason to watch is for McAvoy's performance. It's one of the best ever put on film. Being a Shyamalan movie I was trying to predict the crazy twist ending that he is known for, and of all my guesses I wasn't even close. That is the sign of a good movie. Overall, easily Shyamalan's best movie since the Sixth Sense, and unlike that one, this is one you can watch more than once. I give this an A.","

I suspect many people are caught in the whirlpool of enigmatic pretension of this movie, as if smart people would be able to appreciate it, and hence convinced themselves it must be a good movie. Another possibility is that my own brain is defective. I am being honest and unbiased here. So you may want to watch the first 15 mins and decide for yourself.","

"barbagvido","20 April 2017","Split is a film directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy as this man with 23 personalities who kidnaps these young girls and they try to escape. Shyamalan's career is quite a story. With his first few movies (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable""...), he was hailed as the new Spielberg and had a bright future. Then, all of the sudden, he starts releasing some bad, bad movies (""The Happening"", ""The Last Airbender""...). Then he redeemed himself with 2015's The Visit which was quite a refreshing thing for the found footage genre and it took everyone by surprise. That gave a bit more hope for this one when it was getting released. And now we can finally safely say that Shyamalan is back on track!I've always liked Shyamalan as a director. He had some horrible movies, but still, he was one of the only ones who mostly had original stories and ideas with movies and that alone makes me respect him. I expected this to be good, but it took me off guards. It's his best since ""The Sixth Sense"" and I'd even go as far to say that it's even better. It has a small opening scene and then it throws you straight into action to assure that you're following. Then, after that, you get to know the backstories and characters little by little. And each new reveal, pumps up the anxiety of this film. From the first few minutes, Shyamalan assures that he has our attention and the feeling of uneasiness grows throughout the movie. Visually, the film looks beautiful and cinematography is fantastic. But even though everything impressed me about this film, there's one more particular thing that blew me away and that's James McAvoy. He has to get recognition on the next awards season. It would be a crime if he got snubbed. Let's just hope he doesn't get overshadowed by someone who got a certain accent right or who perfectly portrayed a mental breakdown in one scene because McAvoy does it all here. He was incredible and boosted up the creepiness in some scenes. The rest of the cast is pretty good too, but all of them are overshadowed by McAvoy. And also, you might know Shyamalan is known for twist endings. Trust me, you WON'T see this one coming.I have no flaws with this film. I loved absolutely everything about it. It's for now my favorite movie of 2017 and it's likely to stay that way. But, you never know.","

"spaceashwin","10 October 2017","I think Split is one of the best Psychological thriller movies in the past few years. I'm not sure if it has comparisons with other thrillers but would rather say that the idea is indeed very interesting. Look at Mrs. Fletcher who tries to convince the audience at the conference that the human mind has evolved to a different stage. Shyamalan pushes this concept even further saying that if there are a set of personalities to explore then the final outcome reachable would be something supernatural which in this case is the Beast. The creation of the personalities, if is a result of the childhood trauma then the idea of a super powered being is something which contradicts the concept of the capability of the human mind. Since the devil lives on after being hit by two bullets( and in this case Shyamalan is not trying to show that there are only two bullets for Casey but the magnitude of destruction that can be caused by the bullets) there is direct reference to something beyond being human. Even if this is one of the finest interpretations out there for Splitm the Director fails to explain indirectly why there is a difference in approach the 23 personalities have towards humans and the approach of the Beast.Are the personalities functionalities for the beast? The use of the spray versus the kill?. Why does the devil need Humans? Is it some kind of vengeance that would actually improve lives of people like Kevin or the beast? I say this because Dennis and Patricia are trying to protect Kevin. Kevin seems to have gone through a childhood trauma so whatever is trying to protect him is not doing so against the devil. All this holds true if the 23 personalities manifest to the beast or like how I said reaches out and becomes the beast. What is the beast trying to accomplish? Will the next sequel 'the Glass' have answers to this? If it had to leave out people like Casey who had been tortured at a young age there is definitely something the beast is trying to prove by killing the impure. Why does it kill Mrs. Fletcher? Is the devil a manifestation of only that kind of emotion related to child abuse? Is that some kind of ideal the beast is trying to put forth? If Barry, Dennis and the others are the outcome of the child abuse and the beast is its final form ,is killing a cure to the angst and anger within Kevin? These are questions that need to be explained! One thing is sure that not all the personalities are aware of the beast. Do the killings by the beast and the protection of Kevin have any kind of relation? In the end I feel the beast lives on the mind of people like Kevin (not all the personalities ) who strangely/accidentally accept the devil with a different set of ideas(Dennis and Patricia take control of Kevin's life-""we are in control"") which in turn helps the beast to live and spread itself farther. Thank you","

"skybrick736","4 June 2017","When it comes to Split, M. Night Shyamalan has put questions to rest if he can ever create a thriller with terrific built suspense or a thoughtfully written twist ending. The story really anchored the film, which relied on intricate dialogue, scene by scene and a limited cast to sell it. What's different about modern Shyamalan thrillers compared to his past ones is his comic relief that he's been able to successfully apply. The ensemble of personalities James McAvoy portrays was engaging, each well-crafted and had their own distinguished presence. Along with McAvoy's performances, Anya Taylor-Joy was also marvelous as the introverted lead female with complexities that were well built. Split establishes an anxiety-filled atmosphere, fluid build up to the end, with little mercy shown to characters and viewers. Split is well worth the watch, and without spoiler, its recommended to watch Shyamalan's early thrillers beforehand.","

"view_and_review","4 November 2017","I had written off M. Night Shayamalan. He had a string of bad movies and it seemed that was the new norm for him: The Happening, The Last Air Bender, Lady in the Water and perhaps there are others I'm forgetting. So, when Split was released and they said it was a Shayamalan production I thought: ""I'll pass.""Then I started hearing the rave reviews. I heard more than one which planted a small seed in my head like maybe I should watch this. So I did.Split wasn't as bad as the aforementioned movies but it wasn't all that great either. As the title indicates the movie is about an individual with dissociative identity disorder (i.e. multiple personalities). One (or maybe more) personality is responsible for kidnapping three teenage girls and it is unknown what his plans are for them. Because it is a Shayamalan movie your mind is trying to dream up all kinds of possibilities.The film moves somewhat slow as the plot is gradually unfolded. McAvoy is adequate as the main character although there was a lot to be desired from the rest. The movie is OK as it explores the mind, its fragility and its strength. It's not Shayamalan's best but it is far from his worst.","

"najafisaghar","8 February 2017","What if at the end of the movie, when camera was closing in on Casey holding a gun in a cage, all torn out and looking horrified, we found out that the whole movie was nothing but a figment of her imagination, a trip to her psyche, to make for and come to terms with her childhood abuse? I was holding my breath and wishing for this ending, when I found out that the movie was actually for real. The loopholes in the plot and in theories of consciousness and identity startled me so much that I couldn't stop asking thinking Shyamalan, the director, did not ask for professional advice on such sensitive subjects. If the ending showed a twisted dark person as Casey was, then the movie could have been PERFECT, literally perfect. But it wasn't. it was an average movie trying to push its way to its desired ending through impossibilities and an imperfect logical reasoning. My question during the whole movie, was how such a plot could be based on ""what if there is something more to people with multi-dimensional personality that direct us to understanding what supernatural is"", what the psychologist, Ms. Dr. Fletcher told her colleague. Multi-dimensional personality is a possible psychological phenomenon but digesting the fact that 23 different people lived in one person, who was also conscious of this mental state which makes it more impossible to believe, was difficult personally. Another question was why did not the psychologist order the hospitalization of Kevin? Shouldn't such people be in mental hospitals taken care of? Other questions could be raised as to How could he live in a zoo without anyone noticing him commuting? Or Can a childhood issue, the one with Kevin and his mother, create such a 'beast'? or Can you be conscious of your multiple personality disorder and shift among characters once you decide? All these questions are left for the viewers to answer on their own. Instead, what Shyamalan could leave for the viewers to find out on the own could be a subtler, implied personality problems and mental fixations such as OCD; the latter one was so obvious in Kevin's behavior that the color yellow and his fixation on cleaning lost its sense. Another disappointing point was the director's desperate act for increasing the movie box office by showing ""unessential"" nudity and ""unjustified"" violence. On the contrary, James McAvoy, Kevin among 22 other names, performed greatly which causes you not to leave the movie hall in the middle of the movie. The supernatural aspect of movie can be interpreted as Freudian. McAvoy, I believe, has gone through three important Freudian phases; the supernatural part, as he turned into a beast was the 'id' part which I believed he has always been trying to go back to; his superego part was present in his meetings with Dr. Fletcher and due to his incompetency to keep with reality, his ego was represented into 23 different characters. This aspect can be further investigated by those interested in Freudian psychology; yet, I still hope that the beast at the end of the movie had been metaphorical.","

Not to mention the twist from ""normal"" suspense to ""monster incorporated"" suspense toward the end just a tad bit ridiculous.I found the whole movie somewhat drawn out, way beyond achieving the suspense factor which I gather Shyamalan was aiming for, and which I think he failed dismally - it became instead repetitious and boring.The ending I found totally ridiculous - a zoo?? and God forbid it left the viewer with the knowledge there is to be a sequel, which I will be giving a 'big fat miss'.","

"jboothmillard","5 February 2017","Director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs) has had a string of failures, including The Village, The Happening and The Last Airbender, I heard the reviews and saw the clips for this new film, it seemed worth a go. Basically, three teenagers, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and outsider Casey (Atlantis's Anya Taylor-Joy) are kidnapped by a man, who they later realise has more than one personality, in fact he inhabits twenty-three. The kidnapper, Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) was a victim of abuse during childhood, he has severe dissociative identity disorder. Kevin's personalities include ""Dennis"" who is a control freak and has obsessive-compulsive disorder, ""Barry"" who is an artistic fashion designer and the dominant personality, ""Patricia"" who is an assuring prissy woman, and ""Hedwig"" who is a vulnerable nine-year- old boy. While the kidnapped girls try to find a way out, including manipulating the various personalities to escape, Kevin in his other guises often visits his psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), who believes some of his personalities can manifest unique physical attributes for each personality. As ""Dennis"" and ""Patricia"", Kevin warns the girls that they will sacrificed to ""The Beast"", the twenty-fourth personality waiting to be unleashed, he also talks about the possibility of this ""real"" personality emerging with Dr. Fletcher, who is trying to understand the reason for his disorder. While this is all going, the film goes into flashback to see five-year-old Casey (Izzie Leigh Coffey) and her own traumatic childhood, who suffered the death of her father (Sebastian Arcelus), and was molested by her uncle John (Brad William Henke), who became her legal guardian, she completed shooting him with a rifle, but hesitated. Eventually Dr. Fletcher slowly realises something is wrong and that Kevin is hiding something, and Kevin meanwhile does bring out the feared personality ""The Beast"", capable of superhuman levels of strength, speed, mobility and the hunger for human flesh. Marcia and Claire are killed by ""The Beast"", but Casey manages to escape, it turns out they were trapped underneath Philadelphia Zoo, where Kevin lives and works, ""Dennis"", ""Patricia"" and ""Hedwig"" exert permanent control of Kevin's body. In the end, the news of Kevin's crimes is reported on the news, he is nicknamed ""The Horde"", someone in a diner watching remarks that it reminds them of a wheelchair-bound terrorist from 15 years ago, an older David Dunn (Bruce Willis) tells them it was ""Mr. Glass"", this is a twist ending revealing it is a sequel to Unbreakable, ""The Horde"" is supposed to be another villain of Dunn's story. Also starring James McAvoy ""Barry"" / ""Orwell"" / ""Jade"", Neal Huff as Mr. Benoit and M. Night Shyamalan as Jai, Hooters Lover. McAvoy demonstrates his splendid acting ability as the lunatic kidnapper with the severe personality disorder, he is both chilling and at times amusing, the supporting characters never know which personality they are dealing with, it is creepy almost all the way through, and it is a good twist to the kidnap scenario movie, but the flashbacks are pointless, and the ""twist"" ending is nothing that memorable, the film as a whole is so-so, an average psychological horror-like thriller. Worth watching!","

"CinemaClown","7 April 2017","From the writer-director of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable & The Visit, Split is a small-scale psychological horror that marks another right step in M. Night Shyamalan's road to recovery and finds him making skillful use of his rediscovered creativity & passion to put up a simple structured, competently crafted & morbidly humoured chiller that's dark, mysterious & wickedly amusing.The story of Split follows a trio of teenage girls who are abducted by a man diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and who has manifested a total of 23 different personalities so far. With no one to rely on but each other, the girls try to compel one of his identities to help them escape and must do so before the emergence of a far sinister & frightful 24th persona.Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan whose filmmaking career has seen both soaring highs & crushing lows, Split is a more confidently executed feature from him that makes efficient use of all his trademarks, and keeps its tense vibe alive from beginning to end. The characters do lack flesh on their arcs and are thinly sketched but their predicament is still relatable to an extent.Shot majorly in a single location, the isolated setting do bring a sense of unease into the story and it is further enhanced by its smooth handling, sharp focus & controlled movements of the camera. Editing briskly paces its 117 minutes narrative, few scenes are drawn out longer than expected and its eerie tone rarely goes away. The film keeps throwing surprises throughout its runtime and few of them manage to stick.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley & Haley Lu Richardson, with McAvoy & Taylor-Joy chipping in with commendable work. Not all the 23 identities appear but McAvoy does well with whichever ones make it to the final print. Taylor-Joy is just as good if not more and the moments between the two make up for the film's best segments, plus it only gets better as plot progresses.On an overall scale, Split is a well-directed, well-scripted & well-performed horror that may not be as memorable as the finest examples of its genre or even Shyamalan's best works but it definitely ranks as one of his better directional efforts. Enjoyable, entertaining & quite satisfying, Split is a thrilling ride that keeps the viewers engaged in its premise from start to finish and wraps itself up with a game-changing final twist that no one saw coming. And for that alone, it's worth a watch.","

"GrahamCrawford2005","24 January 2017","There seems to be an emerging narrative that he's back. Maybe because the budgets are smaller people now see M Night Shyamalan as some kind of underdog that we should be rooting for. And I do root for him because I think The Sixth Sense is a classic and Unbreakable, Signs and The Village had their moments. But a string of jaw-droppingly awful films - Lady in the Water, The Happening, The Last Airbender and After Earth – obliterated my confidence in him. Some reviewers hailed The Visit as a return to form, but despite a promising concept the idiotically implausible characterization of the boy, who literally can't move when he's afraid, killed it for me.But that's Night. In nearly everything he does there is a critical plot point that is so contrived and ridiculous it takes me right out of the film and I can never get back in. It wouldn't be so bad if his tongue was in cheek and he had some fun with it. But it's always something banal presented in a profound, meaningful way as if it's some earth-shattering artistic insight. Add Split to the list.The three central performances are strong. James McAvoy is wickedly convincing as the split-personality psychopath. Betty Buckley has quiet strength, dignity and great intelligence and compassion as his psychiatrist. Anya Taylor-Joy, so powerful in The Witch, pulls you in with her big soulful eyes and makes it impossible not to root for her. But I would argue that the only reason her two friends are taken hostage with her is as a pretext to film pretty girls in their underwear. They are completely superfluous, unless one buys the story's malarkey that the Beast personality needs to eat them to gain strength. (I didn't) Walling the girls off from each other early in the film is a waste. I was much more interested in how they might work together to outsmart their captor and escape.Casey's (Taylor-Joy's) backstory told in flashbacks undercuts the suspense of the present-day storyline. (It's Night's overworked theme of everything, no matter how seemingly remote, eventually tying together.) It would have been far more interesting, and McAvoy's character much more sympathetic, if Casey had stumbled across him doing something incriminating and he had reluctantly taken her hostage and now doesn't know what to do. But of course that would have been a less sensational approach with less box office potential.There are nods to The Village (sort of) and Unbreakable (big-time) at the end that are fun, but in the case of Unbreakable, make little sense when you think about it. Night longs for a fusion between the real, humdrum world and the supernatural that, while terrifying, forces us to confront our demons and gives life meaning and purpose. I'm down with that, but he pursues this artistic objective in such a repetitive, immature way it bores. He knows film school tricks and how to manipulate a camera (and sometimes an audience) but I'm always aware I'm watching a movie, I don't get lost in them. He tries too hard to impress and in so doing ties himself in narrative knots that he can only escape through clumsy magic-for-beginner tricks.Split opened well at the box office on the strength of McAvoy's showy, ""Next Hannibal Lecter"" performance. And pretty girls in their underwear. But I would be willing to bet the next time Night is given a big budget he'll blow it. Because unlike truly great filmmakers, he just can't seem to think of anything original to say. But man, he keeps trying.","

"johnberg-39983","14 May 2017","Movie fans has spent too many years now with Shyamalan bashing, why they are tired of it (and themselves). They found a glimpse of light in ""The Visit"", which indeed was a big step up compared to his recent movies, but it was still a mediocre and not very memorable thriller comedy. The reviews, however, often made it sound like a minor masterpiece.This movie is also a step up, but not at all the fantastic comeback everybody hail it to be. ""Split"" would fare better without the twist, which appeal to fans of one of his first movies, but really is awkwardly inserted. Or, it would fare much better if the twist WAS inserted in a skilled and seamless way. Now it is a surprising bullshit ending -- everything leading up to it is muddled, too convoluted and hidden among details which have nothing to do with the twist. The plot you get in this movie is far away from the clear and distinct structure and storytelling in Shyamalan's first movies like ""Seventh Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". You could see these movies a second time and be amazed by how every small detail fitted in the machinery which revealed itself in the end.Not here.","

The main concept of this movie is a really good idea, but how they did it, is absolutely bad. I am very sorry, that this movie did not meet my expectations. I gave four stars, because I saw something from M.N.S. vision in this movie, but this was far behind the previous movies of him. I recommend to see Identity or Primal Fear. Both movies are far better ones, than this one with multiple personalities.","

To call this movie horror or smart or clever, even in the slightest, is a flat-out insult to the viewer. This movie sucks- waste of time and money. The critic's seem to have viewed a completely different version and praise this movie up and down. Not only not scary, but just not a very we written and developed story line. So much potential was lost here. I'm baffled by the rave reviews of the critics, are they smoking something that might have made this an entirely different movie?","

But they all have enough to make them enjoyable, for me anyways (except for 6th sense).Here the story is good, imagine 10 clover field lane it the kidnapper had different personalities, McAvoy is really good, I don't normally care that much, i mean acting should always be good.. it's their job, but you can tell when he switches between one personality and another and he plays them well and adds to the movie. annoyingly, the rest of the cast are awful, script wise. Even when the kidnapper is being an 8 year old child sitting in a corner they still don't attempt to escape, when one of them suggests maybe they should all attack him, being 3 of them, with countless objects in the room to use as weapons, the main girl says no, in an attempt for her to be the reasonable an clever one... OK so you'll be expecting a twist, it's a bit different here, and I'm not sure about it, but the fact is i've been thinking about it quite a bit and so i guess it must be good! although i hated it at the time.. and still do...","

"baileycrawly","15 March 2020","Every now and then, a Hollywood actor comes out and does the seemingly impossible.
In Split, James McAvoy brilliantly portrays a man with multiple personalities, providing a distinct portrayal for each and every character. They truly are their own entities existing within his body, and it's fantastic.
The premise of this movie is simple. A troubled man with multiple personalities kidnaps three young women and holds them hostage as they try to escape, warming up to the character's friendlier personalities and trying to trick the less cooperative.
It was fun and creepy without heavy reliance on jump scares, which is refreshing for the horror genre. There are also a few moments that are genuinely quite humorous.

It shouldn't be considered as a horror movie as there wasn't any scary moments for me, but overall it is still a good movie.","

"AnishMisra","8 April 2017","Plot: 3 Girls are kidnapped and kept in a place by a man who suffers from multiple personality disorder. He has 23 identities of himself and warns the girls of a 24th one who is about to come.Review: This review of mine will be containing some Spoilers, so please if you haven't watched the film please don't read the review.So Split is a film directed by M. Night Shyamalan who is mostly known for the films which have some sense of super-naturalism in it. I saw this film with huge expectations and man the expectations (if not all) were met. The film is 117 minutes long and I was invested in it for most of the time.Talking about the plot of the film. The plot started out as a somewhat normal Kidnapping type of film. But then as the story progresses, we see that the kidnapping goes way deeper than what is was meant for. For me, the pace of the film started after 30-35 minutes or so. I guess that is when Kevin's personalities come to light. At first many people would think how the hell is Shyamalan going to manage the space for 24 personalities. But yes he does. Hats off for that. I also for some time wondered what the hell does Casey's backstory have to do with this. But you see that the backstory is an integral part of Casey. Also we do have a Dr. Karen who's character is fleshed out quite good who tries to help our protagonist (antagonist).Now about the performances. James McAvoy (who I better know as Professor Charles Xavier of X men) killed it. The personalities were portrayed by him were near perfect. I especially like the characters of Patricia and Hedwig. The 24th character (Beast) was not too convincing for me (Maybe I have a taste for violent films, so that is why I was expecting some gore in that part). Anna Taylor as Casey was also great. Actually if you see it is a film about the way how both Casey and Kevin deal with the abuse in their childhood in the present day. The film shows the contrast between these 2 behaviors in a very nice way. The role of Betty too as the caring doctor was great.My Favorite scene would be towards the climax where Casey tells Kevin's whole name. Kevin comes to his normal self and asks Casey to kill him. But then the other personalities of Kevin come and scare off Casey. As I said above, the Beast wasn't too convincing for me, but Casey's fear during the scene actually made up for the horror that was needed for the scene.Spoiler reveal: (which I had actually known for quite some time). We see Bruce Willis in the end as David Dunn sitting in a cafe watching a news about Kevin. Many Unbreakable fans (as myself) would be quite happy seeing that. Many people were waiting for a sequel to a Unbreakable. And I am happy we have got something close to that. Shyamalan too has said that his next film will be in this U/S U (My abbreviation for Unbreakable/Split Universe). So can't wait for David vs Kevin (if that would be the plot for the next film in this universe).Final word: Split is actually a great film. Do watch out for the great performance by James McAvoy. Although little loose during the start, but once it keeps the grip it never loosens it till the very last scene. The opening and closing credits are also done in a quite interesting way.So for me Split is an 8/10 film.","

"jpismyname","26 February 2019","Upon watching the trailer, I assumed Split is one of those horror movies doomed to be flops. But I was wrong.Split is about three teenaged girls who are abducted by a man. The title suggests that the man has a dissociative identity disorder. He has a lot of personalities (16 personalities, correct me if I'm wrong). And each personality has a different memory and attitude.James Macavoy gave me creeps in portraying the unsettling villain. Anya Taylor-Joy also did a good job portraying the young woman with a troubled past. The story is creepy, and the reveal that the villain actually has superpowers didn't shock me (because of spoilers) but it was great. The ending reveals that this is actually the sequel to Unreakable. Makes me excited to watch the third movie.Recommended.","

"eddie_baggins","2 February 2017","Until last year's mini-comeback The Visit hit our cinema screens, it seemed like the ""it"" thing to do was talk down the undeniable talents of M. Night Shyamalan as a filmmaker.A writer/director of unique vision that gave birth to one of the greatest debuts of all time with The Sixth Sense and followed it up with the memorable Unbreakable and Signs and the underrated The Village, only to be found wanting with misguided films Lady in the Water and (cold shudder alert) The Last Airbender and The Happening, the young director seemed to have lost his way and everyone was having a great time reminding each other about it, but showing once and for all that you can't keep a talent down forever, the commercially successful and critically liked Split see's Shyamalan back doing what he does best, delivering audience appeasing thrillers with fresh unpredictable twists.While not reaching the grand heights of his early products, Split which ends up going to some fairly dark and twisted places as it deals with a group of abducted teenage girls led by The Witch's Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey and their increasingly demented encounters with their adductor Kevin, who just so happens to have a further 22 personalities with an added addition on its way, is a constantly engaging and often unpredictable beast that is anchored by a powerful display of acting turns from James McAvoy.Whether playing the OCD Dennis, the child like Hedwig, the fashion introvert Barry or an array of other identities including a late starter to the horde in the films final stages, McAvoy dominates the film and elevates it to grander heights than it's somewhat slight narrative aims go for and while Split is unlikely to be a film awards season cares to recognise come the end of 2017, there's little denying that we've already seen one of the year's most standout acting displays and arguably the turn of McAvoy's still developing career.The other highlight of Split is seeing Shyamalan back on impressive directing and writing duties with the film featuring a number of tension riddled examples of direction (and a standout dance scene) and a number of brave writing choices, some of which will shock the audiences in the later stages, and in particular give greater meaning to Casey's plight.It's great to have the Shyamalan of old back, not to the level we know his capable of, but Split is a thriller with a difference, filled with an odd yet evident heart and James McAvoy having the time of his life running wild with one of modern cinemas most spine-tingling villains. With the added addition of an end coda likely to please Shyamalan fans of old, Split is well worth your time.3 ½ cd players out of 5","

"jaysanchu07","11 September 2022","M Night Shyamalan strikes back! Split is one hell of a psychological thriller that captivates. It has an intriguing premise, a ""horde"" of amusing characters and one for the books storyline that delivers engrossing horror, deserving of a second & third watch.Split is ultimately carried by the dynamic performance of James McAvoy, who evidently gives his 100% to the role. He plays each personality distinctly, whether through voice or expression, paving the way for riveting scenes where McAvoy slips from one persona to another. Through his discomforting yet fascinating brilliance, his character(s) is then able to convey all the essentials of a horror film villain. He is cold and calculated in one scene, violent and menacing in the next, leaving audiences nerve wrecked, on what could happen next. All of these executed, without the need for special effects. Fine work!As for the genius behind the curtains, Split is as well a reminder, of how great a filmmaker M Night can be. His use of dark and claustrophobic visuals, elevates the film's appeal & horror. His writing delivers brooding tension, whether from the captives' struggle to escape, or the masterful depiction of the bizarre elements of McAvoy's DID. His use of therapy sessions for expositions and back stories for perspective, flawlessly enrich the narrative & ensures audience appreciation of his characters. The film's final acts was as well jaw dropping and rewarding, rivaling Sixth Sense as having the best closure for M Night films.Overall, Split delivers quite an impactful watch. The riveting narrative, messages on exploitation & brand of horror are well received through remarkable acting & fine screenplay . It is then a film that cements McAvoy as a worthy actor & M Night's resounding return to form.","

Although Shyamalan holds a special place in Hell for what he did with The Last Airbender, I will say I am impressed with his first real hit in over 15 years. In the end, I decided to give Split a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. The film had great acting (for the most part) and had a great story, but its anticlimactic ending and horrible supporting characters really bogged this film down.

"LCShackley","9 December 2017","The only reason I gave this film any points at all is because of James McAvoy's performance, which was impressive in its range (see similar films by Peter Sellers or Alec Guinness to compare).I enjoyed ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"" and have been waiting ever since to see if MNS can create another film on their level. The answer seems to be no.I thought this would be a psychological thriller, which it leads you to believe. But it ends up being a cheesy ""comic book"" style movie, with scantily-clad teenage girls being abused and a supernatural human monster. I thought at least there would be some big ""reveal"" near the end to make it satisfying, but there wasn't. Are we supposed to be impressed that it all took place in a zoo? (Notice that ""zoo"" starts with zzzzzzz...) Or that this film is apparently a sequel to ""Unbreakable,"" a forgettable movie I saw ages ago? There's also a subtext about child abuse which is disturbing. The psycho was abused as a child, and we learn that the survivor girl ALSO was abused...by a creepy uncle. She has marks on her body from cutting and from cigarettes, which we don't see until about 1:42:00 - self-inflicted, or done by uncle? And at the end we learn she is still in the custody of said uncle. This girl is supposed to be smart, yet she says nothing to anyone about the abuse?Now MNS reveals this is the ""middle film"" in a trilogy. And if you're familiar with other middle films of trilogies, you know that usually means an unsatisfactory ending and a plot that just treads water. That's what we have here, folks. Don't waste your time, despite good performances by McEvoy and Buckley.","

Some of the personalities know that this is wrong and try to talk to his doctor, but the evil one, Dennis, takes control so the others can't talk to the doctor. Eventually we know about 1 more personality, the beast, whom can climb walls, has leather like skin, is more bulkier than Kevin. At first the doctor doesn't believe the Beast exists, but soon learns different when she goes to Kevin's home. She's knocked out as soon as she discovers the kidnapped girls.Then the beast shows up and only Casey is left, but he let's her live because he knows she has suffered abuse like he did.FINAL VERDICT: Just suspend belief and believe that a guy can grow bigger muscles and become animal like because it's a different personality.

"JodyBruchon","8 April 2021","This movie brings up an astonishing number of possibilities for plot advancement. It had a solid cast that gave excellent performances. It had a load of interesting ideas at the beginning. There was so much that was right about this movie, so why give it one star?It squandered everything that it could be and crashed into the ground.I don't want to give away spoilers, so I can't explain in much detail, but the two problems that killed this film were the complete waste of a setup given the ultimate path taken, and the an ending that is unsatisfying and uninteresting. The ending feels like it was set up to lead into a sequel, but I'm not aware of one existing. If I were to liken it to a restaurant visit, this film is like a mouth-watering menu with great prices and fabulous pictures that invoke your curiosity, but the food that you received being unimpressive fast food that isn't what you ordered and is inexplicably covered in a ton of tartar sauce because it's always better to surprise the customers than not, isn't it?I really feel like this film is the best film at one thing only: snatching failure from the jaws of success. So much potential flushed right down the toilet, and all it left behind was tartar sauce and frustration.","

"stevenrotherforth","16 October 2018","SplitSplit is a return to form for writer/director M.Night Shyamalan and also offers a career best performance by James McAvoy.
Or should I say career best performances?
McAvoy plays Kevin a man diagnosed with twenty three distinct personalities. He is responsible for abducting three young women and holds them captive against their will.
What is most impressive about this tightly scripted thriller is McAvoy's ability to switch between the personalities so convincingly. Every little trait and mannerism is brilliantly performed as he changes his voice and body language to create the distinctive characters.
One moment McAvoy could be a nine year old boy and the next he's a creepy OCD ridden middle aged man.
He bounces from one character to another with seamless efficiency.The three kidnapped girls must find means of escape before a twenty-fourth personality surfaces.
One that is monsterous and all together evil.
Ana Taylor-Joy is the stand
out abductee as she plays Casey Cooke. A troubled girl with just enough survival instinct to challenge all of Kevin's personas.Split is carefully written and wonderfully shot. Reminiscent of Shyamalan's early work, such as Unbreakable and The Sixth sense.
There's a intriguing twist at the end that links this story to one of Shyamalan's earlier films too.
I'll not give the surprise away as it will set up a sequel to Split and another one of Shyamalan's movies.
Split could be considered to be a sequel in its own right.
Subtle nods may indicate to this but it is only truly revealed right before credits role.
This is a superbly acted, directed and written thriller that is well worth your time.
I'm now looking forward to seeing what will happen next.","

"Cineanalyst","7 October 2019","Although some critics and fans--backed up by box-office receipts--claimed this as writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's comeback, ""Split"" is nevertheless an exploitative, derivative and incongruent horror movie. Like some of Shyamalan's other post-""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) debacles, one can see how it could've been a better picture had the project not been of such an errant mind--straying all over the place--and, ultimately, relying upon a series of clichés--most blatant of which is the filmmaker's trademark twist endings.There's a lot of trash here: it's yet another movie about a psycho abducting, holding captive and terrorizing people--usually young women or teenage girls. Dissociative identity disorder is exploited for the fear of people with mental illness (although, I suppose, it's good that filmmakers seem to have finally learned that schizophrenia has nothing to do with multiple personalities--good riddance ""Sybil"" (1976)). Sexual abuse is exploited for some screwy, Nietzschian moralizing regarding that which doesn't kill you only making you stronger. Both the mental illness and the child abuse are tied into Shyamalan's usual pseudo-religious supernaturalism. And, perhaps worst of all, the supernatural here extends to one of the most flagrantly contrived and tacked-on surprise endings when ""Split"" is tied-in to a shared universe with ""Unbreakable"" (2000), via a cameo from Bruce Willis in an utterly stilted scene, and setting up the subsequent cap to the trilogy, ""Glass"" (2019). The coda of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016), another movie about a young woman trapped with a nutcase, almost seems organic by comparison. Perhaps only ""The Mummy"" (2017), in failing to launch the Dark Universe, has done so poorly in recent memory to establish a shared cinematic universe and been such an excruciating example of MCU piggybacking.Of all the divergent threads here, the one I think was promising was the potential self-reflexive allusion to cinema. ""Unbreakable"" succeeded in this respect by reference to comic books, and ""Glass"" extends this further cinematically. Several elements for something similar are presented in ""Split""--beginning with the actor/spectator dichotomy established at the outset with the well-made abduction scene. Although the main girl, Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), is first seen as an object to be viewed, as the other two girls and one of their dads look on, the abduction scene places her firmly as the watcher, or the surrogate spectator for us movie-goers. The other two girls are oblivious nitwits throughout. A series of car mirror shots and obscured views from Casey's point-of-view support this. James McAvoy's madman is the actor in both senses: that his actions tend to advance the plot and that his split personalities form a performance for Casey to observe--whether to see his reinterpretation of Norman Bates from ""Psycho"" (1960) through a crack in a door or to watch him dance by invitation.He also makes webcam movies of his various personalities, which Casey views. In fact, this is what helps set her free. Yorgos Lanthimos made this self-reflexive connection much better in ""Dogtooth"" (2009), another and far-more-disturbing and intelligently-made film about captivity and perversity. In ""Dogtooth,"" the captivity of the characters became a metaphor for the spectator's illusion of being held captive by the film itself. In ""Split,"" however, one wonders whether Shyamalan even meant to do anything that wasn't entirely superficial. For instance, I doubt the reason McAvoy's character has 24 personalities has anything to do with classic film having been photographed at 24 frames per second--especially given how far removed movies are from such standards (like most movies nowadays, ""Split"" is all digital), and, besides, we only see McAvoy portray six of those characters. One could just as well read in an equally pointless exercise in numerology that 24 refers to the number of hours in a day.Additionally, the Beast personality hinted at the promise of ""King Kong"" (1933)-like self-referentiality--where the monster's attack from a stage after being captured by filmmakers suggests his being analogous to cinema. Thus, it might have been intriguing had Casey emerged from beneath a movie theatre instead of--of all things--from a zoo. (They're all held captive--get it?) On second thought, for a movie and script that is this crowded and unfocused--like a zoo, as the idiom goes--that may be the most appropriate setting.","

But, it didn't measure up and even Bruce Willis showing up could not make a surprise ending possible. The acting was superb and James McAvoy managed the 24 personalities exceptionally well, in fact, the best I have seen since Sally Fields. And while even a supernatural element at the end made it interesting it failed to produce that feeling of satisfaction I wanted, if not expected from M Knight. It may be worth watching again to detect any missed easter eggs or twists, but I can only give it slightly better than average and not up to Sixth Sense standards.","

"davispittman","1 December 2017","Split (2016) is M Night Shamylan's newest film. I was a big fan of his last work, The Visit. That movie really was Shamylan's way of proving to people that he still has what it takes. This movie continues to prove that he still has it, that he's capable of making a great psychological thriller. This movie surrounds James Macavoy's character Henry, well Henry and his 23 identities. Henry suffers from dissociative identity disorder (DID). He is a mental patient who goes to see Dr. Karen Fletcher, played by Betty Buckley. She is increasingly concerned because of urgent emails she keeps receiving from Henry, different identities take Henry over and email her about the urgent situation that's going on. A very dangerous one of Henry's 23 different identities had taken over him and abducted three innocent teenage girls. I absolutely loved the acting performances in this movie. Macavoy is perfect as Henry, and he plays the different identities wonderfully. I also really liked Buckley as Dr. Fletcher, her character is so well meaning and tries to her best to reach/help Henry. As she attempts to get to the bottom of what's happening, these three abducted girls try to find a way to escape. Things grow more and more creepy and freaky as the film progresses. I suggest this creepy intelligent film to any and all who enjoy this kind of thing. 8/10","

"themovieparadise","20 January 2017","In many ways, this is a return to Shyamalan's classic films. It puts its emphasis on characters and atmosphere. Instead of being a horror movie, it's more of a psychological thriller. It builds its atmosphere, and uses it as a weapon to toy with the characters. It employs a subtlety that Shyamalan has lost in some of his latter films. It's a show-don't-tell mindset that allows James McAvoy to shine as his character. McAvoy is absolutely brilliant in this movie. He turns in probably one of the best performances of his career. He completely transforms himself for each personality, really taking on an entirely new character. There are some overt differences between personalities, and then there are some subtle ones. Throughout most of the film, I wasn't seeing McAvoy. I was seeing Hedwig, or Barry, or Patricia. He cultivated these personalities so well and so independently, that you only saw those characters, and not McAvoy. It's hard enough for an actor to lose themselves in one character, let alone close to two dozen. I think Shyamalan and McAvoy share ownership for the brilliance of the performance. McAvoy delivered on his end, and Shyamalan clearly guided him towards the finish line...",NA
"amesmonde","13 February 2017","Three girls are kidnapped by a man and must try and escape before a frightful personality The Beast comes to get them. With hints Red Dragon (2002) and echoes of Sybil (1976/2007) with a touch of 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) director, writer M. Night Shyamalan offers an interesting thriller. James McAvoy delivers a performance of a life time as Kevin who has 23 distinct personalities and one additional one, that all play off against each other, even imitating each other at one point. After kidnapping three girls and keeping them locked up in a cellar, surprisingly it is the edgy visits to his therapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher, wonderfully played by Betty Buckley that provide the most tension as you never know when he is going to snap. The slow undercurrent build up is Split's strength as the girls attempt to escape and we get to know many of Kevin's personas, Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / The Beast / Kevin Wendell Crumb / Barry / Orwell / Jade. While McAvoy's 9 year old doesn't ring as true as the other characters he encompasses, the distinction between each is impressive. Especially the 24th personality which builds up like a High Noon (1952) showdown. Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey Cooke has a developed character and poignant story arc but always feel second to McAvoy.The worn on location feel works, a cellar, long corridors, city apartments and a zoo, Shyamalan's realistic setting has become a staple of his work, which helps draw you into the story. Two of the kidnapped girls feel under developed but possibly Shyamalan purposely does this for the viewer to focus on the third and in bid for you to sympathise with her and Kevin.With a Bruce Willis cameo, the post story twist of sorts will be lost on anyone who hasn't seen one particular film of Shyamalan. And to be honest unless you love this particular film or have a great memory, it will probably annoy rather than entice. That said, all that comes before draws the viewer in. Right down to Dr. Fletcher's assessment of what advantage split personalities can have and its application. Fletcher concludes that 'they' may something more.Although a mash-up of other films, thanks to McAvoy and Buckley it stands out from most in the genre. Shyamalan's atmosphere and attention to detail gives it some gravitas. Overall, worth watching for McAvoy's performance(s) alone.",NA

Almost two hours long, but it flies by at great pace despite the mostly claustrophobic sequences. The story is well put together, but it's not a horror and nowhere near as creepy as the director's last outing in The Visit. Nor does it give its violent moments real life, which is typical of this director. Only three characters, with the minor parts badly underwritten, and mostly it's a two-hander with an interesting antagonism. A few plot holes, and a couple of implausible plot points involving locks. In the end the director adds a decent twist, but then he reveals his ambition and I was left shrugging my shoulders.I looked forward to the lead actor's performance after his showing in Scum, and he does really well, but the lightweight mood drains his power, and the whole thing falls way short of, say, the basement scenes in Silence Of The Lambs. The lead actress is very good in close up.Music is atmospheric but laid on too thick, especially over some dialogue scenes that should have been more powerful with simple delivery. Photography is good, and the editing and writing keep up an excellent pace.Overall: fascinating premise, but the director wimps out on the horror.",NA
"sara_el95","3 August 2021","Aside from furthering the stigma of DID, there are other reasons I didn't like this.From the beginning, no one put up a fight. This could have ended right at the car, if the dad actually fought back, made enough noise against the car to startle the girls so they could run. Kevin gets inside, and still no one fights. Casey does nothing when she slightly opens the door. She should have tried to run. There's no way he could have caught her if she ran from the passenger seat.The girls were pathetic and put up no fight. The therapist made so many stupid decisions like visiting him at his shady place. Should have alerted police or investigators or something, ANYTHING but go to his place unarmed!! Should have said his name herself.The supernatural element was kind of ridiculous!! He turns into a literal cannibal demon that can withstand bullets and climb walls lol.Not sure about the ending, was that him or something?? 15 years later? I'm not sure. But there was definitely no justice and he most definitely escaped after killing and eating 3 people.So many opportunities to take him out and escape. So many opportunities to fight back or break free.They really make it a point that ""sometimes as a shrink you are too caring and too compassionate""... and then you end up like the Doctor. I wish she would have lived.",NA
"ragpap93","1 June 2017","Personally I am not really a fan but I watched Sixth Sense, Signs and Unbreakable. Those three were really good. After making three good films in a row some said the Village was horrible but I did not see it for myself. I watched Happening and Airbender. Happening was a strange horror film and quite interesting but Airbender was where he made an unforgivable mistake. Mentioning Shyamalan to those who loved the animated show is like a taboo. I gave Shyamalan one more chance with After Earth but it was silly and devoid of reason. After Earth was still a unique film if you come to think about it. When it came to Shyamalan it was interesting to watch a potentially good director spiral out into a messy movie maker. Split sounded like a good concept but my expectations were low before I began. Split got into it straightaway, no bullshit and it keeps you guessing at every turn. As the movie progresses your expectations increase and it had a good payoff in the end. But don't you see in a way this movie speaks about Shyamalan directing ability split between the bad director and good director. The good director is back people and hopefully the bad director will not come back in control again.",NA
