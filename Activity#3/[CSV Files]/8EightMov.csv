"Mean Girls (2024)","ryanpersaud-59415","17 January 2024","You know when you photocopy something and the copy looks slightly worse? That's how I feel about Mean Girls (2024). It's an impression of the 2004 classic, a sometimes fun one, but ultimately, far worse in every regard.Let's get this out of the way: this is a musical. I's not bad because it's a musical, it's just a bad one. The songs are pretty terrible; I can't remember a single melody from any of them. They all sound overly flat and processed, and mixed terribly. No duets or ensemble songs either; they all feel designed to be pop songs, which is decidedly a TERRIBLE way to write songs for a musical. Secondly, the songs don't advance the plot at all, often focusing on surface level aspects of a scene. Also, the lyrics are just flat out bad. Why start ""Sexy"" as an ode to Halloween, but then completely abandon that fun premise and have it sound like a generic EDM pop song? Why sing Apex Predator that grating way?Not to mention, this film lacks the iconic score and theme music from the original, aside to briefly remind you of the better movie. Most of the scenes at least feel silent and frankly, kind of awkward.Awkward is probably the best way to describe a lot of the performances. Many of them are impressions of the original, and while some are fun: Bebe Wood gives a decent *impression* of Lacey Chabert's Gretchen Weiners, but without the manic intensity. Avantika is cute and funny at times as Karen, but also acts utterly braindead, unlike Seyfried, who really humanized the role. All the characters' base aspects are dialed up to 11, which makes me suspect the writers didn't understand them in the first place.Three stick out: Cady (played by Angourie Rice) made me realize how fantastic Lindsay Lohan was as the character 20 years ago. Lacking an internal narration (given to Damien and Janice, which suits a stage play but not a film), she's a boring and lifeless character, played by Rice, who often seems uncomfortable in the role and frankly, can't sing. Not to mention her relationships with the Plastics and even Janice and Damien never really feel ""real."" The only time she's convincing is when she's pining over Christopher Briney's Aaron Samuels (who is amazingly even less a presence here than in the original).Janice (Auli Cavalho) is perhaps the most illustrative of how thin and weak the writing and performances are. Not only does Cavalho not hold a candle to the biting, punk rock essence of Lizzie Caplan's Janice, but she's an objectively worse character. OG Janice was charming and smart, but we all understood that she still wanted to be liked and was deeply HURT by Regina. Even whilst hating her, she wanted to at least be THOUGHT OF by Regina. Here, predictably, Janice is effortlessly cool, confident, and has none of the internal darkness the original did. Not to mention that they end up making her a lesbian, which defeats the entire point of the character. Janice looked and acted a certain way not because of her sexuality, but because that's who she was. The reveal that she is, in fact, straight, wasn't an indictment of ""lesbianism"". It simply reminds us not to make assumptions about people.And then there's Renee Rap's Regina George. Oh boy. Rachel McAdams wasn't an iconic antaognist because she was ""mean,"" which is what the writers seem to have thought with this new version. She was smart, calculated, extremely aware of her power and privilege, and unafraid to wield it. Renee walks down the halls and sings about how great she is, but never demonstrates the meanness or the power that Regina is SUPPOSED to have. They softened her character to such an extent that it's hard to believe she'd do most of the terrible things people say she did, to be honest. Rap looks like Regina, but she just doesn't hold a candle.The entire script lacks the meanness and bite of the original, which is core to its identity (it was frequently described as a ""dark comedy""). That script was near perfect, so layered with characters, iconic lines, scenes, dynamics...This script feels toned down, toothless, and lame. When they (frequently) redo scenes in this one, they're always worse. When they rewrite scenes, they're always worse. Even the side characters, such an integral part of making Northshore feel REAL, only show up to say their iconic lines and leave. They also, uniformly, look way better than the original people in their roles.The entire point of that casting was to make Mean Girls FEEL real. That ugly and beautiful people coexist in these spaces and unfortunately, there is a hierarchy there. When everyone looks nice, when everyone seems equally confident, when the film doesn't explore the dynamics of the Plastics or the social hierarchy of high school, when the off colour moments like the racial cliques and Coach Karr and Ms. Norberry being a sad divorced lady (and not happily married, in what feels like fan service for the sake of it), the movie just feels like what a lot of modern remakes feel like: lacking the soul of the original. To sum up how bad the writing is, they have Damien literally say ""only Cady could've wrote that,"" in the (admittedly funny) recreation of the final Burn Book scene. A moment that was implied through glances between characters needs to be explained to the audience here.I could go on and on, but this is long enough. Mean Girls 2024 is good for one thing, reminding you of the excellent original and making you want to watch it again.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","AngelHonesty","21 February 2024","A poor imitation of the original. It follows the same plot line and events as the original movie, but does it in a way that it so cringe and painful to watch. The movie felt like a theatrical high school musical play. The musical part did not help the movie in anyway. And some of the songs and scenes were so cringe, like when they pretend to be animals. The movie had a really strong massage about not bullying or putting people down, because we are all just people with feelings at the end of the day...The film moved really quickly because it had to make room for the singing. It was over the top light and airy. The movie feels like it's trying too hard to be funny. If anything the movie felt like a parody, mocking the original film. By the middle of the movie I wanted to walk out, it got so boring and exhausting to watch.The entire film can be summed up in this one message, they push really hard. ""Calling someone ugly is not gonna make you better looking. Calling someone else stupid does not make you any smarter. And as women we have to be able to trust and support each other""","

"Mean Girls (2024)","mrashtastic89","14 January 2024","The original 2004 comedy Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters and starring Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams, is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it too many times to count in many different fashions, so needless to say I was extremely nervous to view this version, because what if it was ruined? And need I say, it was pretty awful. I mean come on, a cringey modernized musical version that nobody asked for? Why?This version took everything that was original and fresh about the original and puts it to shame, instead of being funny it was focused on cramming every social media platform ever, TikTok? Check, Instagram? Check, etc. And frankly it was not fun seeing these iconic characters burst into song at the most random moments ever, 2 songs from the Broadway version weren't even in the thing 💀.Renee Rapp hard carried, but if it weren't for her this would be a 1-star.D-","

"Mean Girls (2024)","imseeg","24 January 2024","Wanna experience a headache caused by an avalanche of failed jokes? Try watching this flick for more than 15 minutes.The bad: I tried, I really tried to watch it through, but what's painfully obvious from the very start is that the jokes all fall flat. I just didnt laugh once. What's a comedy without some solid jokes? But then again, comedy is quite personal, perhaps a teenage crowd wont mind the avalanche of lame jokes, that gave me a headache.Not any good then? Tina Fey wrote this stuff. She often gets it right when it comes to comedy, I love some of her other work, but somehow this movie just tanked.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","chenp-54708","12 January 2024","I don't see what's the point of doing another Mean Girls.I enjoyed the original Mean Girls. I thought it was a clever take on the teen genre with fun dialogue and energy and the characters are memorable and hilarious. This adaptation is based on the broadway version of Mean Girls with a new cast (including some recurring actors) and musical numbers. But honestly, even with Tina Fey back, I didn't like it.Throughout, many of the production designs, setting and the direction is solid although it does feel cheap like something from a straight to DVD project. Whether it was intentional to create a stage atmosphere, the cheap quality and production is lacking. The costumes, make-up and the lighting is solid and the direction from the filmmakers, while doing their best to handle the project, feels unbalanced regarding its satirical and comedic tones. The best aspects are the performances as the cast members do a pretty good job on performing their roles. Angourie Rice, Reneé Rapp, Auli'i Cravalho, Christopher Briney and the rest of the cast members bring solid energy to their characters and roles. Regarding the singing, maybe it's because since I haven't seen the Broadway version, I found the musical numbers and singing to be not great and unmemorable as some of the songwriting and musical tones were either mid or pretty clunky.The narrative, with some changes, is pretty much the same as the original but while the writing does try to create something fun, unlike the original, the narrative, chemistry, and energy doesn't feel the same as this one felt bland and derived to what made the original one really good. There were a few humor aspects that I did find to be good but otherwise, weak.I understand this is based on the broadway version and it brings some new energy and grounds to the scene but I don't see what is the point of doing a new version for Mean Girls when the original is already iconic. I can see it being a spin and satirical take on the current era of teen generations but I just feel this new edition feels quite unnecessary.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","rogerdob","18 January 2024","I was very excited to see this movie, however the moxie was a mess. The film was directed by two inexperienced filmmakers...while it can be a courageous act to take a chance on unknowns, one should be certain if they have talent. All politically incorrect humor was removed, overuse of the ""tik-tok"" effect, terrible casting, songs that really weren't songs, and basic story-telling rules that are taught in Filmmaking 101 were ignored. I gave the movie 45 minutes of my time...I could not suffer through another hour of it! Tina Fey is an extremely talented writer...I don't what went wrong with her involvement...was it just a paycheck for her?","

"Mean Girls (2024)","pedroquintaoo","13 January 2024","Despite the potential appeal to newer audiences or those unfamiliar with the 2004 original, the film falls short in various aspects. Avantika Vandanapu's performance as Karen Shetty exudes charisma and humor, marking her as a standout in this undesired remake due to her skillful portrayal of Karen's innocence and enthusiasm and that's the only good thing.The majority of the songs are forgettable, repetitive, and dull, detracting from the narrative's depth and diluting the film's intended message. The voices of the actors, barring a few exceptions, compound the film's challenges, making the lackluster songs even more difficult to endure.Angourie Rice's lack of charisma hampers her portrayal of the protagonist, presenting a humorless and personality-deficient version of Cady Heron. Renee Rapp's take on Regina George adds to the setbacks. Despite her efforts, she comes across as a budget-friendly rendition of the original character-cruel but lacking the comedic or iconic presence.In essence, while Vandanapu's performance stands out, the overall experience of the remake is compromised by questionable musical choices and underwhelming character interpretations.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Imashelbob","6 February 2024","This was the worst movie I've ever seen. The most unnecessary remake to ever be made. I didn't watch the trailer or read reviews before I went to the cinema because Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies of all times, so thought surely it has to be good.But it wasn't. As soon as the opening scene started I realized I'm going to have a hard time finishing the movie. Why was this like watching a 2 hour TikTok? Why did this have to be a musical? Why were all the songs so bad? Why was the acting so bad? Why were the only good parts about this movie, the parts they just copied from the OG? Which makes it even worse, because that means there was absolutely NO reason for this remake. You would only maybe enjoy it if you have not seen the original so the good jokes are original to you. I hated every minute of this movie.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","zkonedog","20 January 2024","2004's Mean Girls is an all-time classic film. The Broadway musical adaptation of more recent vintage is a solid and engaging adaption of it. This re-framing of the original and the musical is an odd--and largely ineffective--mishmash of the two that needed to ""pick a lane"".For a very basic overview, Mean Girls is a quasi-remake of the '04 original, featuring new-girl-to-school Cady Herron (Angourie Rice) being shepherded by friends Janice (Auli'i Cravalho) & Damian (Jaquel Spivey) through the high school experience--most notably the Plastics trio of Regina George (Renee Rapp) and her minions Karen (Avantika) & Gretchen (Bebe Wood).I'll start with the one piece of good news here: there are just enough entertaining songs in this flick to keep it from being outright boring. ""Revenge Party"" & ""Sexy"" are absolute bangers, and a few others are quite engaging too. There were a few times when I was ready to metaphorically throw in the towel on Mean Girls, but then another song would unspool and keep me hooked a bit longer.The big problem with this sequel/update/reboot, however, is that it tries to have its cake and eat it too. Had this been a ""Mean Girls for the next generation"" flick, I think it would have succeeded wildly. Unfortunately, despite elements of that approach, it is far too ""shot-for-shot-remake"" of the '04 version to tell much of a new story.Or, writer Tina Fey could have simply done a more straight-up adaptation of the Broadway musical--which is fantastic! That show is filled with heart and the proper homage to the original material without being burdened with repetition of it.Sadly, this version tries to walk the beam between the two and ends up tumbling off. It simultaneously feels like an unnecessary remake of the original and an unnecessary clipping of the musical. Not even some great musical numbers can mitigate that.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","vassiliskounelis","21 February 2024","As a fan of the original Mean Girls, I was eager to see how the 2024 remake would reimagine the iconic story. However, this remake fell short of expectations, feeling unnecessary and ultimately disappointing.One of the major missteps was the decision to turn Mean Girls into a musical. While the original film had a perfect blend of humor, wit, and social commentary, the musical adaptation felt forced and out of place. Instead of enhancing the story, the musical elements detracted from the plot and made the entire experience unwatchable.Furthermore, the remake failed to capture the essence of what made the original film so beloved. The characters lacked depth, the humor felt forced, and the plot seemed like a watered-down version of the original. It felt like a shallow attempt to cash in on the success of the original rather than offering anything new or innovative.Overall, Mean Girls (2024) is a disappointing remake that adds nothing of value to the original film. I would not recommend this film, especially to those who have already seen and enjoyed the original. Stick to the original Mean Girls for a truly entertaining and memorable experience.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","mjanelle-24974","14 January 2024","I really wanted to like this one. I really did. I love the original, and of course, i know this is a different movie, based on the Broadway musical based on the original (and all written by Tina Fey). Of course i know that there was no need for a direct remake, since the original was near perfection. However, this just didn't work. There was no chemistry, no motivation for the characters. I did like that it's done from Damian and Janice's point of view. But the rest of it feels flat.The positives - Renee Rapp has a voice on her, as does Jeremy Spivey. For me they were the highlights of the show. There are some cute moments. Some new lines, but nothing really memorable or quotable.So, meh. It was OK.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","writetonight-1","13 January 2024","For those of you who are fans of the Broadway musical, here is a list of the missing music:
""It Roars"" (replaced with a song that's not as good)
""Where Do You Belong?"" (What were they thinking by leaving out this showstopper?!)
""Meet The Plastics"" (Only Regina's first few verses were sung. Gretchen & Karen's parts were cut)
""Fearless""
""Stop"" (Again, what were they thinking by cutting out a showstopper?)
""What's Wrong With Me"" (reprise)
""Whose House Is This?""
""More Is Better""
""Do This Thing""This is supposed to be a film version of the musical, not a remake of the original fetch & flawless film. So, leaving out so many songs was a bad idea. The characters all suffered from this choice; they all seemed too bland.Cady did not sing ""Apex Predator."" Instead, Damian sang ""And though Janice is great, she does not have this power,"" while Janice shrugged. This was such a poor choice, because we didn't see Cady falling under Regina's spell. Gretchen's changing relationship with Regina didn't play out well. The actress who played Gretchen captured the character when she spoke, but when she sang ""What's Wrong With Me"" in Regina's closet, it just didn't make me feel for her. Something got lost in translation.A lot of the comedy was lost in this version. Although ""Sexy"" was filmed well, Karen just wasn't as funny as she was in the 1st movie or the Broadway version. Damian wasn't as funny; without his biggest songs, he didn't shine.""Fearless"" may not have been the biggest hit song, but I felt the loss of it. There needed to be a sharply hit moment when Cady realizes she is the new Queen Bee, freed of her oppressive relationship with Regina. The original film used voiceover to convey that realization and the musical used the song ""Fearless."" The film musical kind of glossed it over.Another thing that was missing was the image of all the plastics walking together, all looking beautiful and glamorous. ""Being in the Plastics was like being famous."" On Broadway, ""Apex Predator"" captured that feel, but in this movie, the song focused on Regina alone and lost the power of the clique.The Plastics just weren't feminine enough. Everyone looked too tough. It was like this version took place at the ""south side"" school that the principal said he left in the original. Even the nerds didn't seem nerdy enough. Regina started out looking like she had already been eating Calteen bars for months and we didn't see her change after Cady tricked her.The chemistry between Cady and Aaron also did not come through. Leaving out ""More Is Better"" and the Aaron's part in ""Stupid With Love"" didn't help.""I See Stars"" was a magical finale on Broadway, but this film did not end with musical magic.What did I like? ""Revenge Party"" was still lots of fun and it was filmed in a colorful way. ""World Burn"" was done well, and ""I'd Rather Be Me"" had a great energy.","

I just know that I love the original movie and was excited to see a fun new take on the original. It wasn't the worst thing, but I was surprised at how low budget it felt while I watched it. I even adjusted my eyes a couple times thinking maybe it was me. The songs were great, well performed. The dancing was legit and fun. The acting was below average. The execution was poor. It repeatedly misses the mark. I felt like I was watching a lifetime movie in the theaters. I was disappointed but, it's hard to remake a classic, and this is an example of that. I do think Regina was excellent in this film, but that's about it. Swing and a miss.","

The cast did a great job but the directing and dialogue was OFF. It was so forced. None of the jokes landed. Before someone even finished a line or a joke they were already starting the next scene.There was absolutely no flow. The movie felt like an unorganized fever dream. The only reason I'm giving it anything more than 1 star is because the cast really did slay. Regina sang her heart out. Karen won best actress. Cady and Gretchen were meh. Everyone else also did well. The movie was just made and put together without any direction.Sad that this had so much potential.","

This might work beautifully on a stage, but it doesn't work here. Listening to the lyrics I realized that they were supposed to be funny, but I wasn't even smiling, much less laughing. I see a lot of reviews saying that the characters can't sing, and I think that aspect was fine - they can all sing well, I just hated what they were singing.

They wanted to have the feel of the original but still make it feel like 2024, after all, there's a big different between the times lf the original and the musical. The musical part was fun...sometimes. Some of these actors/actresses just weren't good at singing. I adored Karen's ditzy side in the original but I just couldn't like her character in this one. Same with Regina, she was the ultimate mean girl in the original. In this remake I felt like she just couldn't reach that level. The look and feel of the whole movie is a little off.

"Mean Girls (2024)","malmevik77","26 January 2024","Mean Girls (2024)What a piece of garbage! This unfunny, uninspired, unnecessary film somehow exists. The original is a classic, and I don't mind remakes, or reimagining, of films. This should-have-been-direct-to-video turd is the film version of the musical. OK, I'm on board with a musical but there are no good songs, at all. There are also no good performances, by anyone. Bad staging, bad costumes, just bad bad bad.I made it through the whole thing, somehow, because there are a few giggle worthy moments, and all of them are from the actress who plays Karen: Avantika.The problems with this version of the film are myriad, but the worst offender is that I have yet to find any mean girls. The creators of this decided that the world has had enough of being mean, gosh darn it, and threw their tantrum as one throws spaghetti at a wall hoping something would stick. What stuck was an overabundance and forced-down-your-throat attempt at diversity and inclusion that, oh by the way, has some plot thing that's glossed over.Seriously. It's nearly 2 hours of ""look at me! I'm special!"" performances that is definitely not a representation of the real world. I wanted to actually see mean girls, not 2 idiots and a leader who is detached from reality. You can even tell that nobody fears these people. Regina George also needs a stylist. These people are called the plastics, but you'd never know. The ""clique"" is very much the sad and pathetic, while the awesome people are caricatures of all the stereotypes you can possibly imagine, unless you're white and straight. Then you're homely, not attractive, and downplayed for loud, obnoxious and flamboyant characters.Avoid this at all costs. There is no message worth searching for as the film is quite clear from the start with their ""yay! Diversity equals everyone's happy!"" I think I'd be less harsh if they didn't advertise this as Mean Girls. It is nowhere near that.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","taybear-21075","12 January 2024","Cady literally could not hold a tune in this MUSICAL movie. Renee was phenominal as well as 90% of the supporting cast. However, I thought that the way they redid the iconic rock songs seemed lazy and the camp theme from the broadway musical just was not hitting the same. Really felt like they were holding back with the jokes and the meanness of the movie. Cady was more unlikable than the main mean girl which is really saying something. The casting of Cady really put a bad taste in my mouth the whole movie - they took the OG songs and gave her parts to other cast members because she couldn't even hold a tune. Whoever her agent is needs to be fired bc why would they put that poor girl in a musical.","

Positives I should say I still laughed a few times and enjoyed a fair amount; I usually praise nearly everything I watch in this case Mean Girls was a big disappointment! I must say I don't know what they were thinking creating a remake especially as a musical, the plastics weren't as admirable, the acting was worse, and amazing vibes that the 2004 version had just wasn't there in this one! One of the great aspects is 3 original cast members are in this, the rest of the cast was solid. Appreciate my thoughts or not I'm a guy with autism proud of it too.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","aguilera1685","12 January 2024","Caught an advance screening, and 3/4 of the people around me agreed - it was just ok, but not good. NO HATE, but 90% was a downgrade from the original complex and multilayered material where everyone, down to cast with just one line, delivered absolute STAR power. In 20 years since that original, a lot has evolved within the high school arena, so production naturally had to tweak some things to make it work. Some of it works, much doesn't.Judging on its own merits, I feel it simply would work better on a stage, and that the biggest fault lied with Casting, who hired *singers* who needed more time with acting coaches. I'd probably like it in a stage setting. BUT, this is the silver screen - and the magnifying glass is much less forgiving.The biggest offender for me - and seriously NO HATE because she seems super lovely and may just be better suited in other things - was Karen. Every moment with her was eyeroll inducing. The acting was actual amateur high school production level (at best) cliche ditz caricature with zero nuance. Gretchen lacked any energy or drive, or that absolutely obsessive DESPERATE need to be needed by her queen - she was instead very pedestrian. Not a member of the queens herself but just a follower. And that Queen (Regina) didn't give me the level of commanding stone cold respect and fear in the student body like the OG did. While the actress is very beautiful and talented, she didn't deliver on the respect-demanding queen bee of the school for me. It felt like a Nickelodeon show or something. The trio all fell so flat - they weren't QUEENS of the school who everyone bowed down down to and lived in fear of, they're actually just the wannabe girls who would have worshipped and aspired TO BE that original trio.I truly didn't understand the change of Jingle Bell Rock at all and how the school was so quickly able to turn on Regina when she essentially suffers an actual big accident on stage and people are then essentially posting upskirt vid of it. Baffling and unrealistic. Hit by a bus is the bar to be deserving of pity but not the stage mishap? Uhhok. Damien's song choice change however? Hilarious. Getting diarrhea on a Ferris wheel is way too extreme and actually mortifying vs the previous nuanced ""at Barnes and Noble"" where it would be just embarrassing for the character knowing her friends knew. The difference between overly dramatic teen girls and everyone in real life. Overshot on that one. And while Tina and Tim being in a relationship is a fun evolution on their flirty repartee in the original, Ms Norbury's divorce and life-in-shambles aspect brought a lot in to the character. Although hilarious, she's more one-dimensional now.I'm sorry but Aaron Samuels is supposed to be *h-o-t-t* and he's just a regular guy. There's no context to make him so desired by the Queen of the school and it makes no sense. It's like the character of Guy in Never Been Kissed - the movie wants us to believe he's a heartthrob but doesn't give us the goods to do so. Why casting was so forgiving when he doesn't even bring singing talent leaves me scratching my head. And Busy Philipps, who I normally enjoy, felt like a one-dimensional cardboard cutout of the role that Amy Poehler gave so many layers to, a total tour de force and showstealer.Damien and Janis were fine actors and good singers, though I would have liked them to feel like more of outcasts. Janis was punk and glam and fierce, not a social outcast. With this generation being more accepting of alternative lifestyles and less inclined to outright bully and ostracize, I understand how that presented a challenge to the filmmakers, but they didn't deliver at accomplishing it, and I feel thats integral to the story.NOW, for the GOOD, Cady had excellent energy and played her role well in both acting and singing. Grand slam there. Tina Fey was effective at changing Ms Norbury enough to keep it fresh, while allowing for things that were omitted to not be mourned - bravo! The bit like she was about to break into song but was just clearing her throat was a riot. I also really appreciated this slightly elevated version of Regina post-accident. Being drugged up and having a resolution wth Cady and being loopy at the Spring Fling was a fresh and funny take. And obviously, it was great to see the cameos and Easter eggs- Lindsay saying this has only happened once before, the cutout tanktop brief flash, etc.Obviously, with more negative takes than positive, I understand people won't be happy or agree with my assessment, but it's just the reality of how I felt. NO hate towards this very vocally talented cast, I wish them all the best in their future works!!! But I don't feel any need to revisit this one. It turns out, the limit does, in fact, exist - and it's just 1. But decide for yourself.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Tayyasqueen","26 February 2024","I absolutely love the original Mean Girls. It's a damn classic. This new one was difficult for me to watch. The mean is too mean somehow? Regina and all the other characters in the original were more subtle and comedically with it. I love Renee Rapp and only watched for her, but the film let me down. It feels like there is no life and depth to the characters. Maybe with the musical numbers, there simply is not enough time to develop and go deeper into their stories. It feels flat and was difficult to get through. With that said, the actresses and actors are beautiful, and the film is visually well executed!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","javierbaron2008","12 January 2024","I saw it yesterday out of curiosity. I don't recommend it.Too many sung dialogues. The new version of Mean Girls, by using so many musical scenes that look like video clips, forgets to give adequate development to the characters. They look one-dimensional, flat. Unlike the original, which was a good movie because of the good construction of characters.They focused too much on the musical and the film has narrative gaps and potholes. Empty and plastic.You leave the room and immediately forget about it.An unnecessary remake.Everything good that the 2004 version had does not appear anywhere here.Although Angourie Rice is a good actress and a good choice for the lead, she can't do much with a script that doesn't offer much to her.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","kevin_robbins","15 January 2024","My wife and I caught Mean Girls (2024) in theaters last night. This musical tells the story of a girl homeschooled in Africa who returns to the U. S. and faces the challenges of high school - navigating cliques, understanding popularity, and trying to survive.This picture is codirected by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. (Where Have All the Flowers Gone), and stars Angourie Rice (The Nice Guys), Reneé Rapp (The Sex Lives of College Girls), Jaquel Spivey, Avantika (Senior Year), Christopher Briney (The Summer I Turned Pretty), Tina Fey (Date Night) and Tim Meadows (The Ladies Man).This musical rendition of ""Mean Girls"" is brilliant, showcasing some characters, songs, and circumstances that outshine others. Overall, it's a worthwhile experience. Reneé Rapp, Avankita, and Bebe Wood shine, rivaling or even surpassing ""The Plastics"" from the original. Angourie Rice delivers a solid performance, though less compelling than Lindsay Lohan, and Christopher Briney holds his own. The entire cast is stunning, and Jaquel Spivey delivers an amazing breakout performance. The ""Cautionary Tale"" opening and the two songs during the costume sequence stand out, along with the ""wild animals"" high school scene. The sets, attire, and props are impeccably chosen, making the unfolding story enjoyable despite its predictability.In conclusion, Mean Girls may not reach the heights of the original, but its comedy and solid delivery of musical numbers make it a must-see. I'd score this a 7-7.5/10 and strongly recommend it, especially for fans of the original movie.","

I would not suggest watching this unless it's free bc it was a waste of money. I was really hoping it wouldn't be as bad as the 2nd mean girls movie.....& it was. They tried to be too serious and funny at the same time but the most funny part of the original movie is that they didn't take anything seriously. I didn't really like that it was a musical it gave a corny vibe. Not because they weren't talented singers but more because a lot of the cast was better singers than actors. I did like some actors. I'm sorry but Gretchen was not giving off the same vibe it felt so forced. Katy was not the same either 😒","

The original is way better and has better pacing than this version. Plus 80% of the actors are not fit for the roles they got. It's also missing the best part which is the original Christmas show dance. Some of the meta jokes were fun but they didn't space them out enough. The mean girls were not mean enough and it seems they were very afraid of offending which I get but this feels like they put safety guards on bullying. Also the lesson is punched so in face you can't not understand it and made me feel like they thought I am stupid.","

I'm quite open minded when it comes to musicals, even if they can seem a bit out of place - this however, was just bad altogether. The plot, the cast, the jokes, the singing - nothing made sense when put together. It was so bad I'm not sure what to even write here. Some of the best things about Mean Girls was completely cut out and then some bits were just identical when they didn't need to be.

Overall, a mediocre retelling of an iconic movie as it feels like a musically modern imitation rather than a remake, and it does not help that the musical numbers are not that well executed.Pretty Bad Direction (The direction macroscale was kinda poor because the musical numbers were not the best choreographed and the world wasn't built well; the direction on a microscale felt like an imitation of the original 'Mean Girls' movie but with a modern twist; the direction of actors was decent as most of the performances stayed true to the course (though just not as good as the original); the storytelling was decent as they used the audience's knowledge of the previous story and coupled with musical numbers to move to plot forward (which ultimately replaces the narration and straightforward style of the original)), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Angourie Rice (Holds her own and shows some promise as a singer (but does not have the same charm as Lindsay Lohan)), Pretty Good from Reneé Rapp (Embodies the character well and has a good singing voice (but just does not stand out as Rachel McAdams iconic performance)), Good from Auli'i Cravalho (Mostly on par with Lizzy Caplan's performance and has the best vocal performance in the entire cast), Decent from Christopher Briney (Not as good as the original character but holds his own well), Pretty Good to Good from Tina Fey (Continues to pretty much play herself and other characters she's played), Pretty Good to Good from Tim Meadows (Feels like he is doing an impersonation of his previous performance (though he still is memorable in his own right)), Good from Jaquel Spivey (The only performance that was truly better than the original as he has a great sense of comedic timing and a good vocal performance (when he's given the chance)), Pretty Bad from Jenna Fischer (Just feels off and not in time with Angourie Rice), Decent from the rest of the cast (While the performances are not as good as the original, everyone holds their own as there is no real sour performance that stands out)), Decent to Pretty Good Story (The story is basically a musically modern retelling of 'Mean Girls' as there are no deviations from the original plot; the plot structure was actually better as they cut out some of the unnecessary exposition and put more emphasis on the climax; flow between sequences was decent; the character writing was the same as the original (providing nothing new)), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue was basically a modern version of the original (with them putting more emphasis on the iconic lines); the humor was decently on par with the original (but there is less charm because it reuses a lot of the same jokes), the movie has the best joke if you combine both of the movies; the symbolism is pretty shallow and the message is pretty predictable (the movie is pretty simple in itself, so it really shouldn't be taken that seriously); the foreshadowing is nonexistent because the songs make reference to key points from the end (with the overall movie being just fan service)), Decent Score/Pretty Bad Soundtrack (A lot of the songs were just stupid and tried to force in references from the original movie, though there are some songs I did like), Bad Cinematography (Incredibly nauseating and just felt very cheap (seen in the musical numbers) and amateurish (especially when they would cut between full and widescreen)), Pretty Bad Sound (Felt kinda cheap and felt similar to how other musicals mix in sound), Bad Editing (Tacky and cheap as it tries to emulate the 2020s social media era), Decent Production Design (Tried to emulate the original movie), Pacing was a good pace for the whole movie (this time they fixed the pacing issues towards the end), Climax was executed better this time around as they had more time to play with and had a good build-up (felt more balanced overall and ended where it should), Tone is very different from the original (and this is mostly seen with them replacing the narration with musical numbers), The marketing for this movie was a big issue because they made Regina act like the main character and barely included Cady (even though Cady still is the protagonist)","

"Mean Girls (2024)","superfox_888","25 February 2024","Good musicals use songs to forward a narrative. Bad musicals tell a story, stop to sing about it, then continue the narrative before stopping to sing about it again.This film does the latter. Just like Heathers: The Musical, they have taken a perfect film, shoved a bunch of songs in there which add nothing, just to repackage existing IP and sell it to fans of the original. The charm from the original film is severely lacking here.I liked the actors playing Janis and Damien. Everyone else seemed like they were reciting lines for a high school read-through. Angourie Rice was a competent Cady before the Plastics version; after becoming Queen Bee she was still caught in the before version, lacking charisma needed for the role.This version encapsulates the narcissist generation where everyone is the Main Character on their own social media, which is great for an update of the film. There are other things I liked about it, but they are few and far between.","

To see a musical I really enjoyed be changed in almost every aspect just left a bad taste in my mouth. Almost half of the songs were cut (leaving us with about 12 songs, which is odd considering this is a musical) and the songs that were not cut were changed, whether that be in the lyrics, tempo or both. I wish we could have just gotten a stage recording or a remake of the original mean girls movie. Instead we're just left with this mess. I did appreciate the Lindsay Lohan cameo though.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","AfricanBro","20 January 2024","Two really elderly gentlemen came to the early release and I thought that was adorable. Anyway so, I watched the 2004 one, I was kinda shocked the new one's a musical. I don't think I'd have gone to see this if I knew. The '04 had a better start, I really liked the rifle joke. Though I didn't plan on comparing them extensively, they're so similar that it feels more like a remake for the new generation than paying homage.I like that it retained the same teachers, with the principal still dealing with the same arm issue, and the slang 'fetch' persisting. Many elements remained unchanged, making it more of a remake, as mentioned. I have mixed feelings about Reneé Rapp as Regina; having seen her in 'The Sex Lives of College Girls,' I felt like I was watching Leighton Murray's high school experience before college.In other ways I'm glad I watched the first mean girls so I got references but in other ways it'd be better if you forgot about it before now. Maybe watching this with a vague memory, because I had finished watching Lindsay Lohan's mean girls literally 20min before going to see the new one.Songs were great and I'm not a musical person, but I got tired of them after a while. Also, I'm unsure if the remake was overdone; now I don't know any high schoolers to confirm if it's an accurate portrayal of Gen Z, but it felt exaggerated. The first Mean Girls felt more believable and relatable, maybe you didn't see yourself in any specific characters but you could've known someone like them from high school.I don't like musicals and just like most of them I think the movie would've been fine and shorter if it was just normal film with no singing. However because it's so similar to the first one which was such a huge success, I guess it needed something to set it apart. Especially since it follows similar character tropes, stories and quotes, so I might not like musicals but it made sense.A good laugh I got was the coach going ""she should be lifting through her glutes."" I love how it integrated 'TikTok' culture for modern day, because that made me think of all the gym pundits who're always reacting to stuff and criticizing form. However I was the only one who burst out laughing in the theater at that part. But generally the movie did get laughs elsewhere. Like the Teacher, Tina Fey trying to sing was hilarious.It's pretty predictable because the bulk of the story is mostly the same. Lindsay Lohan cameo was a nice touch. I love Amanda Seyfried, but I think Avantika played The dumb girl really well, it was hilarious. It's the one bit of this film I think it did better than the first, she was written better.Overall, I think the first one is obviously better, but this remake is respectable. No one was asking for it. I enjoyed it more than expected, though it might not reach the cultural phenomenon status of the original, I think that'll probably go to Barbie.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","braydentrinkleuk","17 January 2024","As someone who knew the original Broadway Musical before watching this movie, I was expecting a lot. The musical definitely outshines the movie far more and so if a good recreation was done it would be phenomenal. Unfortunately, it was a mess. There were lots of poor acting choices that I would blame directing for like Karen not just being an idiot but apparently she now can't pay attention to anyone. It would've been fine if it was left to occasional spacey moments but this girl constantly looks blank. The cinametography was also poor with many extreme close up shots that did not help portray anything. There was only one of these shots which was actually done well nearing the end of the movie. Another problem was that all of the vocals felt fake for the most part, while the actresses playing Cady and Regina sounded okay but there were obvious auto-tuning which made it annoying to listen to. Many of the best songs were cut short or had lost content, like Meet the Plastics. My last problem is that big changes were made to Gretchin which basically make all the jokes originally for her fall flat. Gretchen was originally Jewish, likely Ashkenazi. The joke about her hair is because it's so puffy and curly, this joke doesn't really make sense with a straight haired girl who has little volume to her hair naturally. I think they also try hinting at her being Spanish? In the start to the song Whats Wrong With Me. It just kind of made me feel weird to see them take out something so little but still so important to a character.","

Then I saw the previews and I thought to myself - wait a second who the hell needs a mean girls musical...but some of the new one liners were kind of funny so I thought I'd give it a go!The movie is jumbled, the best part of the original is that we got to watch Cadys transcendence into tyranny and this movie made it seem like it just happened overnight-While dragging out other plot lines unnecessarily. They changed enough of the movie to not call it remake and tried to appeal to the younger, less funny and more sensitive generation... I feel like there were too many plot holes because they heavily relied on people remembering the first one and didn't try too hard to connect the dots.Cady - good acting and depiction of the original but has no genuine emotion or likability
Regina - the actress is great but doesn't bring the full mean girl energy of the original
I would have liked to see the actresses who played Karen and Gretchen switched , the actress who played Gretchen didn't bring it at all and is most unbelievable
Of them all.I did enjoy seeing Tina, Fe,The music was just okay not catchy or memorable... The music had a highschool musical undertone but pushed for the pg-13 rating

"Mean Girls (2024)","ferguson-6","10 January 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. High School is a challenging time. High School girls can be mean, especially to each other. Those two points were made quite clearly in the 2004 film MEAN GIRLS, written by the brilliant Tina Fey and directed by Mark Waters. The film struck a chord with that generation both emotionally and through vocabulary. Society has seen many changes since 2004, but evidently High School is still challenging, and High School girls are still often mean. That film was adapted for a musical stage production in 2017, and now that Broadway musical has been adapted back to the big screen for a new generation. Tina Faye returns as screenwriter (and as math teacher Ms. Norbury), and the new film is co-directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr.This is my first sojourn into MEAN GIRLS territory. Of course, I have come across 'mean' girls in real life, but I have not watched the 2004 film, the 2011 sequel (a TV movie), or the live musical production. Angourie Rice (THE NICE GUYS, ""Mare of Easttown"") plays Cady Heron, the home-schooled girl who transfers to North Shore High when she and her mother (Jenna Fisher) relocate from Kenya. Excited for her new adventure, yet uncomfortable as the new kid, Cady is schooled on the social hierarchies (cliques) by artsy Janis (Auli'I Cravahlo, the voice of MOANA) and proud gay Damian (a talented Jaquel Spivey). Most of the education revolves around ""The Plastics"", a trio of snooty girls: the not smart Karen Shetty (Avantika), the desperate to be seen Gretchen Wieners (Bebe Wood), and their leader and school villain, wealthy diva Regina George (Renee Rapp in the role made famous by Rachel McAdams).Regina takes an interest in Cady (a near clone of Amy Adams) and high school life devolves into the mess that it too often is. Cady falls for hot boy and fellow Calculus classmate Aaron (Christopher Briney, DALILAND). This immediately changes the dynamics since Aaron is Regina's ex. Petty jealousies intensify and personalities shift wreaking more havoc on relationships that were never very deep. Brief supporting roles are covered by Jon Hamm as the clueless coach and health teacher, Ashley Park (""Beef"") as a teacher, an over-the-top Bijou Phillips as Regina's mom, and Tim Meadows as the fed-up Principal. Meadows is the only actor to appear in all three MEAN GIRLS movies, and he and Tina Fey each nail a couple of zingers. And yes, you can expect a couple of cameos.The intended message is valuable and delivered clearly, however, for a musical, it's the songs that often seem weak and sometimes forced. A couple of the songs land, but most miss the mark. Renee Rapp nails her song at the Halloween Party, and Auli'I Cravahlo is truly a standout when she gets the opportunity to showcase that voice. ""Gruel"" and ""fetch"" are recycled here for effect, and though the songs are a bit disappointing, we do hope the message is received by a new generation (even if most of these actors look like they should be out of college, rather than clunking through high school).Opens nationwide in theaters on January 12, 2024.","

For example, why did you cut Damion's songs Where Do You Belong and Stop? They even cut the whole scene where Damion tried to save Cady from herself. That's pretty important to the storyline.Why did you get rid of Mr. Herron? Neil Flynn did a great job in the first movie.

"Mean Girls (2024)","jp_91","11 January 2024","To celebrate 20 years of the teen classic ""Mean Girls"", this musical adaptation of the same name comes and the result is very good. At first you can't help but make comparisons with the original film, but once you adjust to the fact that times change, the film is a delight. The script does not go out of style, the message is still present and the question of whether it has really achieved a change in the high school world is still without a concrete answer. Most of the musical numbers are excellent in lyrics and the choreography accompanied by good camera movements gives magnificent results. The performances of the new cast are totally acceptable, and it should be noted that Tina Fey shines again in her character, for their part, the actresses who play the new plastic girls give remarkable performances, Angourie Rice plays very well with the personalities of her character, Reneé Rapp plays a superb Regina George with a femme fatale style, Bebe Wood demonstrates her acting talent as a material teenager with fragile feelings and Avantika is fun and realistic as a giddy girl, it should be noted that all of them have good voices and they demonstrate it in the musical themes, but the one who gives the best performance of the entire cast is Auli'i Cravalho who demonstrates an intensity acting of emotions and a magnificent voice in each song she performs. A different movie with the same feeling as the teen classic from the '00s.","

The characters are pleasant to watch and the writing is good. This is to point out how awful this movie is. Why are they trying so hard? Perhaps because they ran out of ideas and are just mimicking the movies from the past. If this is a remake, it's a terrible adaption. If this is about feminism, it's garbage.

Absolutely not, but that's to be expected because the original was iconic. However, as far as a ""reboot"" or ""remake"" goes, I don't think you could ask for much better than this.I can argue that this movie had a bit more depth to it, from giving Cady more of a backstory to giving each main character their own song to highlight different aspects of that character. I've never seen the Broadway musical, so I can't speak to how many songs they did or didn't do and all of that, but each performance was extremely well done. I particularly enjoyed Auli'i Cravalho's solo being one continuous shot, or the choreography in Reneé Rapp's halloween party song. The casting department absolutely nailed it, and it was especially fun that Lindsay Lohan, Tina Fey, and Tim Meadows all returned. Additionally, there were some great Easter eggs (did anyone notice the cut out shirts from the original as one of the Halloween costume Karen tossed aside) and included all of the iconic lines from the original (you go Glen Coco!)My biggest hot take that no one will agree with? Reneé was a better Regina George than Rachel McAdams. I said what I said.7.8/10.","

And trust me I get making one based of the broadway show but they have taken MUSICAL too literally this year and have a song in literally every scene so every 2 minutes or less there is a song and we walked out not even half way through the ""revenge song.""I was highly upset after I walked out because I am against it, I feel as if they tried to modernize something that did not need to be, changing POV's of the characters was a good change but the movie is line from line of the Original and I only know this because I have watched that version so much over the past 20 years. I do not condone walking out but Its was cringy and did not give that wonderful nostalgic feel, what makes it worse I didn't even make it to the point of seeing the rest of the OG actors like Lindsay Lohan and many more who came back to act in this movie.I will say the production was amazing and well put together in the sense of being able to follow along but all the songs took away from an amazing story, the singers were great they do have amazing voices I just wish there were less cringy songs and awkward moments since the love interest was noooowhere near as smooth as the original.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","nogodnomasters","7 March 2024","We are on the precipice of an age of mediocrity where iconic cultural films are remade as poor musicals fit to insult a Broadway audience. This is a remake of the original with little to no changes in the plot. Renee Rapp does a good job as the head of the Plastics while Angourie Rice had me pining for Lindsay Lohan ever since she trashed her acting career playing Elizabeth Taylor. Tina Fey, who is very talented wasted her efforts on this production. She even phoned in her role as a calculus teacher which is a shame since many of the kids put their hearts and souls into this boring flop.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","tonymicki","29 February 2024","Mean Girls in 2024 is just a copycat (and truth be told it's practically the same, words and scenes from the original 2004 film with little or no difference. It had some boring musicals that differentiates it but didn't add to the plot it but it's the same thing. Awfully bad doesn't not begin to make one explain it. If you looking for something different to the original, then this isn't it because it's the same. Watch the original again if you are a fan of Lindsay Lohan. This 'new' one should not have been done at all. Hollywood really needs fresher ideas & should stop remaking classics like this. This is a 3 over 10 from me.","

In fact, I think it's a little too musical for my tastes-I liked the 2004 version better. The story line is basically the same as the original. Angourie/Cady is home schooled in Africa and starts regular high school, unfamiliar with all the clicks. Renee/Regina is the leader of the Plastics-the hot girls. Auli'i/Janis-a member of the Outcasts-warns Angourie to stay away from Renee's group but later, wants her to infiltrate them and report back to her on her findings. Christopher/Aaron is the boy Angourie falls for but he has a past with Renee. Tim Meadows and Tina Fey return and there is a quick cameo by Lindsay Lohan.It's rated PG-13 for language, teen drinking and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you liked the original, it would be alright to stream. Otherwise, I'd wait until it comes to regular tv.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","barbett-1","14 January 2024","The new iteration of Mean Girls is a very entertaining movie. The songs are great as are the performances by a young and talented lead cast. Renee Rapp and Angourie Rice sing and act wonderfully as the rival Plastics but, in my opinion, Auli'i Cravalho stole the show as the outcast girl, Janis. I came to the theater not expecting a musical, but ended up pleasantly surprised by the energetic singing and choreography. Despite the musical emphasis, the film still retains the wry, somewhat subversive wit of the original. While I enjoyed the original, this is one of those rare instances where the remake is clearly a quality production. It is a real treat if you enjoy musical.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","indybruggeman","25 February 2024","I do not understand how people can honestly sit through this movie without feeling physical discomfort.The writing was so awful, it was embarrassing and uncomfortable to watch. On top of that, most of the actors completely failed to deliver the lines and fell completely flat. Sure, it's supposed to be an adaptation of the broadway musical, but even in that context, it was executed poorly.This just came off as a tired cash grab, to bank off the success of the OG movie and the broadway musical, without any effort being put into it at all. This adaptation was wildly unnecessary. It has no charm or authenticity whatsoever. Shame.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Padreviews","18 January 2024","As always I go to see a film knowing nothing about it and with no expectations. I knew of a film called mean girls with Lindsay Lohan but knew nothing about as I'd never seen & didn't even know there was a musical of it but then again they make a musical of everything these days , there probably Jurassic Park the musical with dancing dinosaurs somewhere that turns out to be a love story! So I judged this on its merits as I saw , and seeing other reviews it appears many fans of either the musical or the 2004 original we're expecting something else and didn't really give it a chanceMy title refers to the song 'I'd rather be me' this was the point where the film notched up a gear from an average or above average 7/10 to 8/10 & then later in the film when the moral story comes out it finishes on a high 9/10.So what's it about ? Well you know I never give spoilers but let's just say it's about the moral maze at a high school where you have the cool kids , the nerds , and the individuals and it's about the way they interact with each other with a little bit of romance thrown in , think Grease , though the musical numbers here seemed more detached than being part of the narrativeIs it worth seeing ? Yes - it's a fun film with morals & a bit of comedy and romance thrown in - it's also very techie & will appeal to the tik tok generationLindsay lohan made a cameo & Pam from the American office was great as the mum . Both lead female roles were great & the story of their battle for the leader of the pack proved a great plot for the storylineGo see it without high expectations & you might enjoy as much as I didIt was better than Barbie - I was expecting it to be as bad!Pad. A 9/10.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","elizabeth_777","18 January 2024","Ive loved the original movie since i was 11 years old. I listened to the musical the DAY it came out in 2018. I am an OG fan. And i LOVED the movie! I listened the soundtrack before seeing it, and HATED it. But it actually worked really well on screen. There were so many new jokes that made me laugh out loud. I thought they did an amazing job modernizing the film.Angourie Rice is a really good Cady. I know they slowed her songs and lowered the key, but i thought it worked on screen. She fit the role so well.Reneé Rapp is the loml. I rememeber when she took over as Regina on broadway. She is SO good. Her voice!!!!!! And the way she played Regina was amazing. Someone Gets Hurt was insanely good. And i got full body CHILLS during World Burn.Auli'i Cravalho is by far my favorite version of Janis. She played her so well, and her voice is INCREDIBLE. Seriously, i've never liked Janis's character until now.Jaquel Spivey was so funny as Damien. His take on the character was hilarious, and his voice is so good. He did a vocal run in Revege Party that gave me chills.Avantika STOLE THE SHOW OMG. She is SO funny and cute. She was a perfect Karen. Though, i do think ""sexy Joan of Arc"" is much more offensive than ""sexy Rosa Parks""😭😭😭Bebe Woods was cute as Gretchen. I actually hated Whats Wrong With Me in the original musical, but i found myself enjoying it on screen. Sad they cut the Ceasar monologue, she would've ate that.Christopher Briney was Aaron Samuels. Thats a fact. He didnt sing??? He wasnt bad, though. His acting was good. Ive never like Aaron's character.Jenna Fischer, Tina Fey, and Tim Meadows were all amazing.And the cameos from Lindsay Lohan and Ashley Park made me scream. So excited about that.","

I enjoyed all the main characters, and also enjoyed the songs.I appreciated that they kept a lot of things the same as the original, even some complete sentences.At times it was clear that the movie was definitely aimed at people younger than me (29), but only a couple times.Generally speaking though, I enjoyed it, it was a fun feel-good movie that I think is a good remake of the original. It won't replace it, but it's a nice addition, and I think the musical-aspect actually works for it.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","KFstudios2009","25 February 2024","Mean Girls, directed by Tina Fey, the actress in the original Mean Girls and now back to direct and play in the remake, isn't a good movie at all. It had small details that I appreciated a lot and that's why I was so kind and gave it a higher rating. Tina Fey is probably an ok actress, she has played in a bunch of movies that you have probably heard of, but I don't know how she got the idea to direct this. What was she thinking? What was Paramount thinking in producing this crap? Let's mention the cast first. Angourie Rice in the main role as Cady Heron tried to be as funny and convincing as possible to be the shy, innocent girl that moves into the new, crowded school, yet she is so plastic (And I mean literally plastic) that she just destroyed the atmosphere. By an hour or so you get used to her and forget about it, yet it is still a big problem. The supporting roles does something, but not much. At least they did a good job with showing the different groups and separations, and how hard it can be to try to fit in, and that message was very strong here, and I think maybe two of my stars goes to the moral. Now let's mention our truly beloved director Tina that makes the movie. Her idea of it, in terms of camera angles, music and set-up, felt very unprofessional. The camera filming was hilarious. There was that one angle when someone runned and was holding the camera, so 90 percent of the face came on the screen. And the montage, cuts, didn't have that smooth flow. Sometimes they tried to make a transition through one scene to another, but as I mentioned, it didn't have that smooth movement. But I mentioned small details I liked, so I can say it right away. About when it's a Halloween party someplace in the film, two friends are watching a horror movie, and they decided to put in a scene from Friday the 13th: Part II, that I really appreciated. Small details like that makes the movie a little bit more watchable, and also, Friday the 13th is one of my favorite horror franchises, also coming from Paramount Pictures. Now there is the last thing I didn't mention, probably the most important part of the musical, the songs! Of course, the songs, what about them? Nothing. It was really nothing, garbage, didn't have the beat, probably written by Ai or something, and I think the authors wrote the songs like that on purpose. You know, to annoy the audience. So ok, should you watch Mean Girls the musical remake? No. A waste of time, nothing worth your energy, and now you have been warned.","

Some films are best left untouched, the original mean girls is one of my favourite films of all time. To now have this 'sponsored by elf' film associated with it isn't something i appreciate.

I'm legit baffled how this car crash got made AND released.I love Mean Girls, my pre teen daughter LOVES Mean Girls and we were both a nervous but enthusiastic at the prospect of a remake. We got 15 minutes in before she said ""please turn it off, this is awful"". ""Thank God"" I said and gratefully complied.Every element was a gaudy yet impressively poor imitation of their original. The musical score was awful (do people really want to listen to this tuneless rubbish?). I assume the score is from the newish Musical? We'd planned to go see it but honestly it'll be a cold day in hell before I put myself through that willingly based on this car crash.It feels cheap, sounds cheap, production values aren't great and has an over whelming air of amateurism.This whole movie should be written off as misadventure and everyone involved should probably be quietly deleting its existence from their CV's.

"Mean Girls (2024)","isaacsundaralingam","2 February 2024","I'll be honest - I'm not a huge fan of the original Mean Girls from back in 2004. Sure it was funny and decently entertaining however, I still don't think it's worth its own Broadway adaptation. I'm also not a fan of musicals in general. So those are two very important factors that could have influenced my dislike this movie, but actually, no. I dislike it cos it's just a disappointing movie.It's almost the same movie as the original, but with none of the charm that made it so memorable. The music is not bad, and that's about the only positive thing I could say. The plot feels incredibly rushed, so much so that it feels like the movie relies on you having watched the original to make up for any missing context. The characters are just not that compelling either - with Cady following a script, the Plastics not being all that mean and Damian and Janis coming across as borderline uncaring and selfish. It feels like an unnecessary movie altogether and does very little to convince you otherwise.That being said, I don't think it's unenjoyable. The high points of this movie being the songs and the vivid choreography does enough to carry it through. Unfortunately, that by itself isn't enough to make a good movie.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","parksiet","13 January 2024","There's no Mean Girls quite like the original Mean Girls, but I can't deny that I had a lot of fun here! I don't see a scenario where you don't enjoy this if you loved both the original movie and the musical. Sure, it doesn't change anything much from the original material's storyline, but it honestly doesn't really need to. It's a fun watch with a fantastic cast - Auli'i Cravalho and Jaquel Spivey steal the show! Reneé Rapp and Angourie Rice were also excellent, I genuinely thought everyone fit their roles really well. Unfortunately as good as the cast is, they pale in comparison to the original cast. The movie as a whole could be read as a pale imitation of a better movie - it's basically the original with musical numbers added in. It's goofier and less incisive than the original, lacking a lot of the bite the 2004 films had, but still has some fun moments. I love Tina Fey, but damn she just recycled exact dialogue. It was like 80% identical, including a lot of the jokes, spoken by actors who are too aware of the original material to be able to deliver it in any way that can be considered fresh. The movie worked best when it wasn't trying to just recreate iconic moments from the original and instead just did its own thing. I think my biggest issue with the movie is that it avoids doing any of the character work the original did, instead opting to assume the audience knows these characters and what they want already - just going through the motions of the story, iconic moment after iconic moment.But what the hell? You know me, I love musicals! I had fun! I thought it was good! I've had the songs stuck in my head since I saw it! People in the theatre were laughing and enjoying it! Sure at times I saw the streaming film it was intended to be, but I am so glad it got upgraded to a theatrical release as this is a movie worthy of seeing on a big screen with an audience!Not since Rob Marshall and Chicago has a feature film debut shown such a confident, innate understanding of the musical genre and how to make it cinematic for a modern audience. You can tell this is the directors' first feature, but it's a good first feature, with a lot of creativity especially with the camera, lighting, and staging of the musical sequences. Coming from the perspective of someone who adores the 2004 film but never got the chance to see the Broadway show - I was really blown away by the music-such memorable songs and so well woven into the story. I wouldn't say it's the best musical out there, but it worked for this! The film feels charmingly familiar but also alive in a fun, fresh way. I liked it; Mean Girls (2024) is a fun, fetch way of rewatching the original!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","cahidi","4 March 2024","When I heard that Tina Fey is remaking Mean Girls into a musical, I was kinda excited. But after watching it, I have to be honest, it's kinda underwhelming. I'm not an expert at criticizing movies, so I can't exactly tell you what didn't work. All I know is that several things were changed. Like how Cady doesn't have a Dad in this version. I personally think that it ruined the happy family dynamic that Cady once had before she turned into a Plastic. Thus diminishing the conflict with her mother when crap hits the fan. They also shift some things around like how Janis took Cady under her wings on Cady's first day of school. She's also got into the Plastics that same day. It kinda rushed the story, since in the original version, nothing happened in the first day. They also omitted several funny stuff like how when Cady tried to get Aaron to go to the place where Regina was cheating on him, it turned out to be the Coach and one of his female students. And like how the Jingle Bell's Rock dance which went sideways when Gretchen accidentally kicked the boom box into her boyfriend's face. Funny little things like those can ruin things if you remove them. They also removed the scene which showed the audience that all the girls have made peace. And that's a minus too, at least for me. The only thing I like is that scene where Cady and Regina forgave each other. That didn't happen in the original version. I don't wanna be mean, so I added another star to my original rating, for Tina Fey.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","willphelan","15 January 2024","This film failed to justify its own existence. This remake keeps a lot of jokes from the original movie but doesn't execute them as well. The film also gets rid a lot of the original film's funniest jokes. It seems like most of the jokes they removed were the ones that could be seen as controversial or offensive but that's the whole point. The characters are supposed to be dumb and mean so removing those jokes hurts the characterization. There are a couple new jokes that hit but not enough. The cast here is simply not as good as the original, especially when it comes to Regina George. Renee Rapp is fine but she's no Rachel McAdams. Her version of the iconic character is nowhere near as interesting or memorable. The film feels like is rushes through the story unlike the original movie which had excellent pacing and a tight script. This could be due to the musical numbers which I normally wouldn't mind but the music here isn't anything special. The costumes here aren't very good. They seem cheap and it doesn't feel like the plastics would wear these outfits. The original Mean Girls is so good and the general story still follows over here so there's a little fun to be had, but the film falls completely flat in every aspect when compared to the original masterpiece. I don't know why they don't just make a true sequel to the original film already because that's what people actually want to see. 5/10.","

Regina George was an okay cast, but who the hell cast Karen and Gretchen? Oh dear.... It felt like they were more focused on filling some diversity quota rather than getting good talent.And then the acting....

"Mean Girls (2024)","movieman6-413-929510","13 January 2024","Mean Girls is a remake of the 2004 film of the same name. This remake was created by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. This remake focuses more on the Mean Girls musical.Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is independent from Africa, where she was homeschooled. Now she is going to a new school where her time has to be precious with other students. In this way she learns about the different types of groups of students that can be found at a secondary school.Cady is quickly seen and accepted by the popular girl group ""the Plastics"". Everything seems to be going well, until Cady starts to have feelings for Regina George's ex (Reneé Rapp), the alpha of the Plastics. In this way she breaks a rule of the group, which can get her into trouble. This is why Cady is now trying to turn things around and destroy the Plastics from within the group. Now she just has to make sure her traveling popularity doesn't become too much.The original Mean Girls film from 2004 is known as a classic, especially among people who also went to high school during this time. A remake after twenty years may seem a bit fast, but a lot has changed in these twenty years. For example, the way student life in high school functions has become very different due to the use of social media and smartphones. For example, participating in bullying is now more often done online. Over time, people have also started to view themselves differently and thus have a different identity or preference for relationships. They have placed these updates to the story appropriately in the film, without presenting it too exaggeratedly.Furthermore, it provides musical inspiration for many creative, appropriate singing and dancing scenes. In addition to their acting, the cast members also know how to provide good singing and dancing moments. Angourie Rice does a good job in the lead role. For Reneé Rapp, this is her first film acting job and she has worked more in the musical and music world before this film. Even though this is only her first acting job, she does a good and fitting job as the mean, popular girl from high school. All the musical aspects of the film sometimes take over the film, so that the character development can be somewhat lost. Connoisseurs of the original version can fill in this missing structure themselves, based on what they know from the original film. New viewers who are not familiar with the original may miss some information.This remake was written by Tina Fey, who wrote the screenplay for the original film. In addition to giving this remake a modern twist, she keeps the story close to the same story as her original. For connoisseurs of the original film, this remake may remain on the familiar side. This way, experts and fans can roughly compare what's happening. Tina Fey could also have adjusted the story a bit more to make this remake more her own.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","rebekahsislowski","18 January 2024","Renee Rapp is a perfect Regina George. I think it is very evident in this movie that seeing her do this musical on Broadway would have been even more amazing. Tina Fey was hilarious in this and of course loved the cameo. I wish that Renee Rapp sang literally every song because she did such a good job. Also, Janice was SO good and so fun that she was also Moana because I know she hasn't been in a ton since Moana and her singing is actually amazing. I didn't love the casting with Cady or Aaron Samuels but they weren't the worst choice. I do think it's hilarious though that they did not market this movie as a musical at alll. If you follow broadway shows then it's obvious that it was going to be a musical but otherwise you would never know lol.","

Now i did not know who Reneé was before this movie but i'm now indeed a fan to say the least.The movie was super refreshing and it gets me excited to see the new generations being hyped about this remake of a timeless classic.I really enjoyed the songs and they've been stuck in my head ever since i went and saw this movie.I understand it may not be everyone's cup off tea but i really do think everyone should at least go give it a shot! But do remember this is a musical remake, 20 years later after the first movie, so if you're going in expecting it to have the same early 2000's vibe, it's not.So dare i say it's better then the first one? Yes. Yes, i do.","

When Karen was singing Sexy at the halloween party she basically flaunts everything in your face.. but it was hilarious to me..Some songs I enjoyed, some songs I didn't.I went in with a clear mind, Didn't want to compare it to the original and was open-minded to it being a musical, and a whole new cast with new humour incorporated into the movie and I do think it was a great musical theatre adaptation of the movie.We laughed all the way through and it was fun and enjoyable to watch :)The storyline follows the original film, so its easy watching also :)Regina was our favourite character and she sings amazingly! Go watch it!","

I understand this version is based on the broadway musical but what fits for stage does not translate to film. It's lost the charm.It races through the story and feels disjointed. Does not offer anything new. New cast are bland. There feels like there is no connection between the characters. There is no no depth or insights into the characters and story.Where I could watch the original over and over (again I know new version is based on the stage musical) this version will not become iconic.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","pbpetel","15 January 2024","""Mean Girls"" offers an amazing, talented cast and impressively composed songs, especially with standout performances from the likes of Renée Rapp and Auli'i. The film's refusal to put males in the spotlight is refreshing, yet it unfortunately receives an underwhelming 6.4/10 on IMDb. This feels unjust given the movie's overall quality. The storyline, characters, and humor make it a must-watch. It's a relief to see a film not solely focused on romantic pursuits, despite potential backlash from certain audiences. This discrepancy in ratings underscores the need for more balanced and insightful film criticism.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","andapan1","15 January 2024","This movie was better than I was expecting it to be. While remakes are often very poorly done and just straight cash grabs, I didn't feel that way about this one. I went in with low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.Now, that's not to say this a masterpiece of a movie, with some really deep meanings or anything like that. But it is a fun movie. Some of the songs were enjoyable and entertaining, albeit a bit silly. But that's part of what makes them fun! I enjoyed the choreographing, and the visual aesthetics created for a couple of the songs were (dare I say it) quite fetch. There were a few jokes here and there that didn't hit, but for the most part I thought that the humor was also well done.Go into this movie with an open mind, and I think you'll find out it's alright. It's not the original Mean Girls, but it's certainly not a disgrace to the franchise in my opinion. Sit back, relax, and just appreciate the entertainment from a good, solid movie.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","ymrhqtrz","13 January 2024","Having read up online that the new mean girls was set to be an adaptation of the broadway musical I had some doubts as I'm not the biggest fan of musicals. However, upon finishing the film without a doubt this film was one of the best musicals I have seen in recent memory. The film being a musical offers us more insight into the characters and why they opted to make the choices that they made. I know that probably won't make much of an impact with most of the people seeing this film. But being able to go deeper into a characters mind especially when it comes in the form of a musical is a wonderful thing for a person like myself who is autistic. Apart from the musical aspect of the film, the film offers us a refreshed and modern mean girls with just the right amount of sass. I sincerely hope that Renné Rapp is nominated next year for as many awards as possible she killed it in this film (from her acting, to comedic timing to her singing) she definitely deserves all of the praise that she is receiving and then some. The only down side I would say is that the film at times felt a little too clustered with all of the musical numbers and it took me a while to get into Karen's character (Avantika Vandanapu) but she eventually grew on me and her acting towards the later half of the film improved drastically. Anyone saying they don't see the need for the new film needs to wake up and smell the coffee, the film was adapted from the broadway musical if you like it then you like it and if you don't but don't leave mean reviews.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","nicolasroop","11 January 2024","There is a lot to love here. The music, the glamour and, of course, the drama of high school. However, it's missing some key ingredients that made the original the instant classic that it is. It is not as witty as it thinks it is and it's nearly lost all of the relatability of it's characters in it's high gloss presentation.Acting wise, the cast ate up every scene and performance. The musical numbers were pitch perfect. The standouts being Aulii Cravalho as Janis. Her voice was perfect for those scenes connecting the films plotline fairly seamlessly. Also, Reneé Rapp as Regina was brilliant casting. Her voice is amazing, particularly in the number at the halloween party. Just wow!As far as the plot goes, there are some jokes and plotlines that are missing. Perhaps due to the times, some of the jokes were not exactly ""pc"". I felt a couple were sorely missed, but it did not mar the production as a whole thankfully. There were some things the film tries to do from the original that kind of fell flat as well. It's like telling the same joke twice to the same audience, it just doesn't hit as hard the second time.Overall, I enjoyed it. It was a different version from the original, but just like The Color Purple, it's kind of meant to be. There are some cameos, including a very standout one towards the end that fans of the original will cheer at! If you're into it or a fan of the original, I say go see it. You won't be mad that you did.3.5 mean girls out of 5.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","vmarshmallow","12 January 2024","Very disappointed that this adaptation of the stage show used only half of the original songs, and shortened others that were kept on. A bit of fun, but a poor translation from stage to screen. Auli'i and Jaquel's dynamic duo carried the movie, and the cameos from '04 and Broadway made for some nice moments. I would, however, much rather go back to watching the original movie or a properly filmed Broadway performance of the Musical version (like Hamilton, but with a lot more pink).It was surprising that the people in my generation (Gen X-Y folks) were the only ones picking up on the cameos, easter eggs and comic moments, while the teen audience members (the target audience) were seen scrolling social media while the film played.This adaptation is a strong demonstration of why continuous reboots are not a good idea. Tina Fey has worked magic in creating the original film adaptation of this Queen Bee cautionary tale, and I hope there are young people out there who are as moved by this retelling as I was by the original book and the 2004 original feature.No more reboots though, please..","

"Mean Girls (2024)","descendants-12797","16 January 2024","I have seen the original film countless times and the stage adaptation twice. I have to say that in full honesty that this movie musical adaptation exceeded my expectations. I went in with low expectations because they shortened a lot of songs and cut out a bunch of songs as well. They replaced It Roars from the stage version with an original song called What Ifs, the melody and rhythm on several songs was changed severely. I was so nervous going in but when i actually saw the film i was extremely pleased with what was put together. The two best numbers in my opinion were Sexy and I'd Rather Be Me. Some songs were better in this film than on stage for example Stupid With Love. The entire cast was exceptional. And having the incredibly sexy Reneé Rapp playing the iconic role of Regina George was probably one of the greatest casting choices in cinema history. She brought the sex appeal and cruelty that Regina George is made of. The stuff they changed from the stage adaptation were necessary changes that were well done and extremely well placed. Also i think it was a very interesting take to make Janis actually a lesbian. As someone who identifies as part of the LGBTQIA+ community it was a very fresh take. It was also really nice to see a plus size gay Black man in the semi-leading role of Damian. Making Karen and Janis non-white was also a really interesting choice that i can really get behind. Especially because the two actresses were incredible in their roles.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","cowza","21 January 2024","So I'm an 80's child and amongst my peers are all those who starred in the OG Mean Girls. I'm naturally a massive fan but was sceptical how this remake would be for me as someone now in their 30s. When the critic reviews started appearing I expected to be utterly disappointed. Gotta say I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It felt faithful enough to the original to feel a comfort, yet new enough to give you plenty of fresh smirks. The music moved the story along so seamlessly, you'd be forgiven to think it had always been there. Casting was pretty solid for me with the exception of Cady, who did not necessarily give a poor performance, just lacked that likability Lindsay Lohan was so good at portraying. It left me rooting for Regina more but I wasn't mad about it. Some characters I actually enjoyed a lot more in this remake, particularly Damian, Janis and Karen. I'm sure Disney fans like me will also love and recognise the voice of Moana aka Auli'i Cravalho. I've liked it enough to now be considering seeing the stage show when it comes to London. Thank you for the escapism Tina Fey!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","masonsaul","23 January 2024","Mean Girls (the musical) is at its weakest when it's being a faithful remake since those moments are just the same but weaker. Whenever it becomes a musical or adds something new though, it becomes a really good remake that updates itself for the modern age and feels different enough to more than justify its existence.It's no easy task following up performances where everyone feels right and everyone here works to varying degrees of success. Angourie Rice always maintains Cady's likeable nature, Auli'i Cravalho & Jaquel Spivey are better than their counterparts and Avantika gets equally good laughs out of her role as Amanda Seyfried did beforehand.Reneé Rapp is absolutely phenomenal, making an iconic role completely her own just as she did on the stage. The confidence from that first musical number is unrivalled and every time she appears it reaches new highs. There's a serious argument to be made that she is actually the best Regina George.First time directors Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. Make sure the film feels cinematic with the shifting aspect ratios, extended takes and a very mobile camera. All of those techniques combined make it feel like cinema, confirming that it was the right choice to give it a big screen release opposed to the streaming debut it was originally intended for.","

But everything changes when she makes the mistake of falling for Aaron Samuels, the ex-boyfriend of alpha Plastic Regina George!I found the film to be actually not bad! I mean, it had it flaws & fault no question, but, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was & was expecting it to be pretty bad! The actors do a great job despite the film having narrative issues & despite shoddy directing & editing it wasn't too bad of a watch!The films runtime is a bit lengthy, but not too bad at 1 hour & 44 minutes! The pacing isn't too bad, but again, like the runtime, wasn't without its flaws! There's some not bad tunes to be had & plenty of eye candy! So, the film can't be faulted entirely!Overall, it's not bad, but it's not amazing either, which is why I give it the rating I give it! I have yet to see the 2004 original & it's 2011 sequel, but I'm sure I'll find them better than this, though can't hate on this one either as it wasn't that bad & was surprising better than I initially thought!6/10.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","mclaum","12 January 2024","To be honest, I went into this movie with very low expectations. Due to the fact the first is an iconic classic with an extremely strong cast, and the fact it is a musical, but was not advertised as one. The little faith I had pre movie was that Tina Fey was involved and I had trust in Reneé Rapp. During the movie, however, I was shocked by how much I loved it. While Rapp did an outstanding job with the acting and vocals for Regina, the real standout was Janis actor, Aulii Cravalho, who voiced Moana in the Disney movie. Her acting was good, but what really was amazing was her vocals. The jokes were actually funny, and weren't reused from the original unless it was iconic. The only complaints I have was that while Cady did a great job acting, her singing wasn't anything special. The songs themselves were great for the most part, with a few standouts that I could have on repeat forever, although I haven't ever watched the musical itself, so I don't have a lot to compare the music to. I do think that Reneé Rapp will get a huge boost from this role.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","rgkarim","13 January 2024","LIKES:It Holds A Lot OF The Classic
-Fey's promises were true, the spirit of the blockbuster is present and accounted for in this version and holds much of the attitude of that Rom Com.-From those first moments in the garage and transitioning to the Savannah, you step back in time, but with a new face that starts to really engage the Mean Girl Spirit.-The drama, the backbone, the scheduling and the events are all there to relive with this new class, and for once doesn't feel too mocking, out of the way, or trying to watch.-It holds nostalgia, and that helps with appeasing part of the group coming into this movie, helping buffer things up quite nicely.Great Casting
-A solid direction for a new age, Mean Girls remake requires getting just the right people to play these iconic roles to not destroy the trust they might have built in the trailers.-For me, I think it was a solid job, most of the group head on matching the feel of their roles, their performances and the movement of the cast in what captures the spirit of the moment.-The personalities fit almost perfectly for me, the chemistry may be a bit more energetic, but still holds that ferocity of the moment, and yet is still so much fun to watch.-I applauded the casting director for finding this new blood and feel these risks they took were done well by the strong lineup presented.Fantastic Acting
-It may not be the most jaw dropping roles or performances, but my friends and I felt the acting for this remake again matched the caliber to some degree of this mixed up world.-Cravalho's edge is intoxicating, the genuine attitude and ire leaking out and standing up the world against the popular flow was inspiring, if not a tad over the top at moments.-Rapp as Reginia is a bit more Charlize Theron delivery. Conniving, acidic, and hypersexual tones will do things the original didn't, but nevertheless make that still fun and menacing villain that holds much to despise and plot against.-Rice as our protagonist may not have as much of the hard edge as Lohan did, but the transition is still strong, playing more to the innocent side for much of the film that I resonated too,. Sure, she needed a little more ice to match that engaging dynamic, but I didn't hate her substitution
-Favorite though goes to Jaquel Spivey, whose play of Damian was sort of the life of the party for me. He's got sass, humorous delivery, fantastic song prowess, logic, and fun all wrapped up in a big package, which helped to really blend everything together.Loved the Set Pieces
-Blending the two genres of musical and movie can sometimes get too lost in hybridizing, but again, Mean Girls 2024 accomplished much for me.-The shooting location is totally high school, and not sure if the same location or not, but had the feel of the American High School system.-When musical numbers come up, several of them had theatrical flair of a stage show, with confetti, costumes and choreography that just lit up a room.-It all came together in this hybridization that many times worked, and that added an engaging piece and to me, that makes a movie fun.Still That Humor
-The movie is stupid, don't get me wrong. We know the quotes, we know the mannerisms, and we know the sass run deep in this kind of thing.-In this iteration though, it finds a way to still make it fresh, appeasing the traditional, and helping really make me laugh at times especially from Damian who seemed the best mixing bowel for this group.-and despite never being the biggest fan, I still had a lot of fun with the movie's quotes and finding that sweet spot of laughter.Tina Fey
-She killed it the first time and she killed it the second, with Fey being the teacher that reaches out to save the day.-On the one hand, she pretty much plays the exact same character. Same lines, same angles, same mentoring, and same attitude that you know.-The other hand, grants a bit of newness with it, some new relationships and modes that the modern era allows that worked well, fit in time with the character, and overall adds some freshness to the role.-Add amazing confidence to the mix and acting quality that makes the teacher feel genuine and you get aces!Much Of the Music
-And the song numbers turn out to be a lot more fun than many of the recent musicals I've seen, really bypassing the one note wonders, and bringing attitude that the best shows for me have.-The opening number is just the tip of the diverse array of styles, all coming together to convey the emotions, but add different themes to enhance the showmanship and keep me invested.-Want a seductive introduction? They have that. A dark-comedical number with pop touches? We got that. Want to have an Avenue Q like medium about predators? They have that.-And the choreography itself sometimes very show tunes or music video vibe, and that adds fun, but sometimes really captures high quality.DISLIKES:Jon Hamm is a Waste
-He's got a few good jabs thrown in, but for the most part, Hamm's talents are not utilized in this movie.-I don't care how limited the role might be, he's got a lot of good in a role like this and reducing to tight shorts and a few dumb moments really didn't feel like the best casting.The Musical Interludes Come Out Weird In Movie
-Something that was a little too musical for me was the sudden interludes into the music for me.-I'm spoiled by Sound Of Music and Grease, two movies that found these top notch musical interludes to help balance song and acting.-But Mean Girls changes are blockier, somewhat forced, and feeling like just an excuse to plop a song into the mix. Sure, some of them are masked as internal thought (my favorites), but others were sort of just quickly jumping into the numbers and it was awkward for viewers like me, best left for the arenas of the stage.Some Of The Editing Seemed Off
-The movies feels a bit too hybridized together at times, and the editing seemed to force us into these unique moments that again felt odd.-In addition, the performances sometimes feel a bit too edited to the modern era to come off one note, the directions being monotone and missing that engagement that others did better, primarily the two plastics.-Throw in the potential scenes lost to make way for the show stopping productions and again you get something that sort of takes away from the movie and makes this confusing hybrid spread too thin in either direction to be completely whole.Pretty Much Verbatim Of The Movie
-I've never seen the show, but I've seen enough of the movie to remember a lot of the lines are pretty much exact.-While this pleases the nostalgic nerd in me, the originality factor takes a hit, and sort of dilutes the movie standing on its own.-And in the songs, it's clever, but at the same time sometimes forced, lines rapidly rapped or forced out in the song that sometimes didn't work for me.The Results:
Overall, I had fun with Mean Girls and really felt Fey accomplished much in this new mode to be fun and nostalgia mixed into one. The music really helps add energy and flair, giving it some fun and a soundtrack to start playing on Spotify, and making numbers that theater productions might not be able to match. A fantastic casting direction, and many fantastic matches to the roles, including Fey herself, further helps bridge the traditional and modern, with great writing to help to further enhance the experience. Add in good editing, a killer set, and all the energy coming together to be a fun time out at the theater. Yet, the hybrid also kind of hurts it at the same time. Editing cuts for characters like Hamm make their inclusion minimal, while also sort of robbing us of those key moments of dramatic clique chaos. Musical numbers, while good, sometimes come in at odd moments, that High School Musical approach that not only feels forced, but trips up the feel and editing of the movie. Some direction changes to make the plastics miss their dynamic calls, and perhaps not taking the chance to integrate some fresher lines further took away from the film.Overall, my scores are:
Comedy/Musical: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","meclote","26 February 2024","""Mean Girls (2024)"" presents a mixed bag of highs and lows in this musical adaptation of the beloved classic. On the positive side, the film boasts some standout musical numbers, particularly ""Someone Gets Hurt"" performed by Reneé Rapp at the Halloween party. This song is a clear highlight, showcasing the film's strengths in its musical elements. Additionally, Auli'i Cravalho's voice as Janice is a delight, bringing a Disney princess-like quality that adds significant value to the musical aspect of the film.However, the adaptation struggles with pacing and character development. Cady's transformation into a Plastique lacks the gradual progression seen in the original, resulting in a jarring and unconvincing shift. One moment she's in her usual baggy clothes, and suddenly she's donning mini skirts, leaving the audience struggling to keep up with her character's evolution.The film does attempt to tackle contemporary issues like the toxic use of social media among teenagers and the harmful practice of constantly comparing oneself to others. These points are well-made and resonate with today's audience. The underlying messages of supporting and backing up each other, avoiding gossip, and not judging others, especially during the formative teenage years, remain relevant and important.However, the movie stumbles in its attempt to adapt to modern sensibilities. In striving for political correctness, it loses some of the original film's charm and humor. Certain jokes and scenes that worked well in the original feel out of place or forced in this remake, detracting from the overall impact.In conclusion, while Mean Girls delivers on musical talent and addresses relevant social issues, it falls short in character development and fails to capture the essence that made the original film a cultural phenomenon. The movie feels like a vessel for its songs, somewhat hollow in its execution, and lacks the depth and wit that defined its predecessor.","

Every good one liner was removed and replaced with a dreadful song with ridiculous lyrics that don't match the tune of the song. Not to mention the disgusting Aaron Samuels. Never felt so physically sick. What happened to my Janis. What. Happened. Her outfits were so off and her personality even more off. She was smiley and gay and had an almost fun vibe which she definitely doesn't have in the original. What happened to her backbone?Absolutely awful movie don't waste your money kids. So much unexplained and making absolutely no sense. Obsurd. Ridiculous. Betrayed. I feel betrayed. Also why did Regina have a soul???","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Galop_Inferno","12 January 2024","For starters, I'm a longtime fan of the 2004 movie. It was a significant part of my preteen/teen years. Easily one of my all-time favorite films. The Broadway musical, which I got to see last year, I also love. If a movie I love can be expanded on by songs and I don't hate it, that's an accomplishment.I was brimming with hype as soon as I learned a movie musical was in the works. I saw it tonight... and I didn't love it. Now, it's not bad by means. I just felt deflated by the end of the first act. I knew the changes were coming, and I was ready. The new song ""What Ifs"" felt too much like a Disney musical opening song, in line with how underwhelmed I was with ""Welcome to Rosas"" in Wish.""Where Do You Belong"" could've been a perfect intro to the cafeteria scene. Jaquel Spivey and Auli'i Cravalho would definitely nail it. A lot of dialogue is nearly word for word of the original, and lack the bite they had 20 years ago. Reneé Rapp slays as Regina, easily the best performance. ""Meet the Plastics"" was so whittled down without Gretchen and Karen's verses. I also wasn't feeling any chemistry between Cady and Aaron. Angourie Rice seemed like she was just along for the ride (I loved her in The Nice Guys) and Christopher Briney is cute but he lacked the charm for me.Bebe Wood and Avantika's portrayals of Gretchen and Karen, granted their characters are Regina's lackeys, have some of that vibe. ""What's Wrong with Me"" felt what it should be but ""Sexy"" came out of nowhere, like they're ticking boxes for giving everyone a spotlight. Maybe it's the whole overt social media presence. ""Someone Gets Hurt"" is where my attention began to come back, and ""Revenge Party"", which is my favorite song, is an absolute delight.It seems that the most cut songs lies in the second half; as Damian's showstopping Act II opener ""Stop"" got the axe, Jaquel Spivey got Cady's verses on ""Apex Predator"". In the production I saw, the reprise of ""What's Wrong with Me"" swung right outta nowhere, and ""Fearless"" could've been this epic number after 'you can't sit with us!' With roughly 45 minutes remaining, the plot just forced ahead to Regina getting plowed by a bus and the Burn Book leak. ""World Burn"" is Regina peak, and it is glorious.Around the time ""I'd Rather Be Me"" comes on, there's a few neat tidbits that stand out, like Ms. Norbury and Mr. Duvall being in a relationship, one of the trust fall apologies being a girl apologizing to her friend for accusing her of dragging during one of the songs (and Ms. Norbury casually waving it off), and when Cady is recruited into the Mathletes, a brief exchange about 'making ""squills"" happen' comes right out of the stage show. ""Do This Thing"", performed during the competition, was cut, with a ""Stupid with Love"" reprise in its place. The Spring Fling scene puts a smile on my face, but ""I See Stars"" also falls victim to being shortened, and sung by another character (making for a nice brick joke).It's not perfect, nor is it bad. It's just fine. Honestly, I guess that's all I can really ask for. It could've been complete garbage. I'm glad it wasn't, and now my friends will be happy because I'm not harping on about it anymore. 7.5/10.","

It felt like I was speed-reading through a book. Each scene was rushed and the acting was horrific. It was like I was watching a middle school play of the original Mean Girls movie. This is the only movie I have ever walked out of because I became physically sick from watching it. It was that bad and I am not even exaggerating. The animation was a strange mix between live action and animation. It felt like I was watching the original movie while drunk. I hate whoever made this movie.","

Loved the nods to the past and the present. None of us ever expect that bus proverbial or otherwise. A great message to be kind and support each other. We all have our issues and growth needed. What a fun and humorous movie to spread that message. Tina deserves all the props for expanding on this classic. High school is such a formative time and these movies always resonate. Go in with an open mind and a joyful spirit and it will not disapoint. Shouts to much of the original cast showing & supporting <3.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","ericgoldberg-50159","21 January 2024","This is a cautionary tale about what goes around, comes around. Cady Heron is a girl who lived in Kenya, Africa with her mother. She transferred to North Shore High School in the US and befriended two outcasts named Janice and Damian. The Plastics led by the queen bee of the school, Regina George, also befriended Cady and let her in their circle. Janice was bullied by Regina in the past and conspired with Cady to get revenge on the queen of mean. Cady suddenly became popular and her status turned her into a vain and petty person. She turned on Janice and Damian. Regina and Cady's karma came around to bite them. I saw the Broadway musical that this is based on and this movie does it justice. The cast performs their parts well. The moral of the story is basically don't try to be someone you're not and don't be mean or you'll be sorry in the end.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","r96sk","2 February 2024","Too similar to the original, though the musical moments do help alleviate that.I didn't necessarily like any of the songs performed in 2024's 'Mean Girls', but none of them grated on me - which is always a plus when it comes to musicals. I could've done with a slightly shorter run time, though the humour is decent - if a bit hit-and-miss.Angourie Rice is a bit meh in the lead role, certainly a downgrade on Lindsay Lohan. I guess most of the cast are inferior comparatively, but I did enjoy the performances of Reneé Rapp and Jaquel Spivey... Auli'i Cravalho too. Good to see Tina Fey and Tim Meadows back again, whilst there's a great cameo at one point.All things considered, it's fine. Can't wait for the 2044 remake.","

I was very skeptical about watching this because admittedly I am a purist and usually have issues with people ""tampering"" with movies I consider classics. This time however I put away whatever idea I had that the original can never be replaced and decided to enjoy this as it's own thing and more of an appreciation piece instead of a reboot. I can confidently say my expectations have been exceeded. I didn't know this was a musical and I gotta say turning this story into a musical is genius.","

I get that must of the cast are not singers and had to change their songs but it was a lot!I prefer the Broadway Show music but... like I said Overall a great movie that respects the essence and core of the OG 2004 Movie and the Musical !!Ps: Lindsay Lohan's Cameo was unexpected and AWESOME!!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","TheJujuZoo","14 January 2024","For anyone who has never seen or heard the musical I'm sure they'd enjoy it. For any fans of the musical, you definitely won't.All of the songs felt very lackluster (except for I'd Rather Be Me). Cut the best songs in the musical, which totally altered the narrative and chemistry of characters.Cady's actress completely lacked the excited naivety of Cady which causes her to fall under Regina's spell. I also think the actress did not have the vocal ability for songs like It Roars and Apex Predator, which is why one was cut and the other was sung by Damien. And it's why Stupid with Love had to be majorly softened for her, instead of the excited jumpy song in the original. She would've been a great Cady if this were just a remake of the original, not a screen adaptation of the musical.A lot of the chemistry between the characters fell short for me. Gretchen was way too mild mannered, not the busy bee gossip she's supposed to be masking her insecurities. And in the end, her song about insecurities was pointless bc her relationship with Regina didn't come full circle. Karen's actress nailed her role and provided some comic relief but it fell short a lot. Cutting their part in Meet the Plastics was tragic. The original song is great and actually very funny. A lot of the cut songs would've nailed the comic relief the movie was desperately trying to fill with dialogue.The directive choice to sing and talk at the camera constantly like it's a phone was off putting to me. I understand they're going for a more ""modern social media"" style, but to me it just didn't land. It was borderline uncomfortable.I think the musical was about as perfect as a musical adaptation could've been, so it's sad they somehow mucked it up by changing almost everything and cutting the highlights for no reason. It wasn't a long movie there was plenty of time for some of the cut songs.I would rewatch it with friends but simply to make fun of it, but as a whole I did not enjoy it.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","benstack-79025","20 February 2024","Firstly this is just another cut n shut high school comedy. That's okay if the characters are funny - good actors, jokes and a quick fire script. The format is purely a platform which again is okay by me and we wouldn't have 80% of our favourite movies if this didn't happen.But this is a bloody musical. A very marmite thing when good and in a theatre. Musicals were around a long time befoer cinema, radio and TV and were the ultimate in entertainment when Gilbert and Sullivan were around.Of course they started to transfer to cinema and now streamers. They do not transfer well any more. The Zenith was probably Grease. It's been downhillever since but we still see them as pilots to convince investors of the big money needed to get tham in theatres. So viewers become an unwitting focus group that doesn't get paid.However if they do manage a long run on Broadway or the West End you're looking at serious money. A huge passive income from each theatre in the world that runs it for 5-10 years plus many other residuals. Hence the justifiable risk/reward.Tina Fey would like some Broadway money too as has every other writer/producer in the business. Her efforts are not good. Or maybe somone cut her in as the writer and it's their fault. This will not succeed. The songs are frothy, generica nd derivative with some harsh auto-tuning in the first 5 minutes.Sadly there are a couple of talented actors in this who will be tarnished with the proverbial brush.I wouldn't be surprised if Tina Fey herself is pretending this thing's never happened. Someone however has decided you can't polish a turd but you can roll it in cheap glitter.","

I appreciate that it's a different take, inspired by the Broadway musical, and penned by Tina Fey, just like the original. A direct remake wasn't necessary given the near-perfect nature of the original. However, this adaptation didn't quite hit the mark for me. The character dynamics lacked chemistry and their motivations felt unclear. On a positive note, I did enjoy the perspective shift to Damian and Janice. Performance-wise, Renee Rapp and Jeremy Spivey stood out with their impressive vocals. The film had its charming moments and a few new lines, but nothing truly stood out as memorable or iconic.Overall, it was an average experience for me.","

People are complaining about the songs being less intense but I would argue that most of the songs still hit, and I think they were sung in a way that was true to the characters.There are a lot of fun little Easter eggs for both people who saw the movie and for those who saw or listened to the musical. The songs were recognizable, a lot of the story was kept, and they came up with new ways to make the movie funnier.I think the music made the movie funnier it broke the tension, and allowed the audience to get into the heads of the characters. It was a perfect balance between movie and musical. I had a really good time.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","chloegalley","29 January 2024","Mean Girls is a 2024 an American musical teen comedy film.It is based on the broadway musical of the same name, which in turn was based on Mark Water's 2004 comedy film the Original Mean Girls which starred Lindsay Lohan.A student gets caught in the crosshairs of elite group of popular girls called the plastics.So I am in my 30's and have seen the original film in 2004 with Lindsay Lohan in and it was brilliant 10/10 there was nothing not to like. Lot of young girls liked it and was popular. A smash hit film !We are now in 2024 a new take on the classic film Mean Girls. It's more modern, you have social media so that's more involved in the film of course it's going to be more cheesier and definitely more dramatised.Where to begin: The story is pretty much the same so is the characters the only difference is there is lot more music/ dancing but then it is a musical. And the fact that main girl comes from a different country.This new generation of Mean Girls was surprisingly good not a patch on the original but then they never are. I think they produced and directed this pretty well considering.It's more of a musical than comedy, there are some scenes that were funny. The acting is definitely over the top.Not so mean as the first film.The singing was pretty good so was the dancing the best thing about this movie was Damian Hubbard and Auli 'i Cravalho and the leading lady Angourie Rice. Now there were good stood out more and delivered a good performance throughout.Considering it was a remake I didn't mind it quite enjoyed it.If you are a teenager and never seen the first movie then you would probably love it.It's typical girlie film don't think men would like it lol.It kind of reminded me of Barbie just not as good.So if you are adult and like things like Barbie, and glee, Greatest days then you love it.If you have children/ teenagers and thinking about taking them or you are a teenager and like movies like High school musical, little mermaid,Matilda then I'm sure they will love it.Don't go in thinking thats it going to be as brilliant as the first mean girls cause it's not otherwise you will be disappointed.All I can say is watching this movie is what you would see in the theatre if I'm being honest.Don't go by the low rating or negative reviews cause they do get it wrong and so do people. Then it turns out that movie is actually good.Make a decision and watch it for yourself and then decide. It's good considering it's a remake.Sit back get comfy and enjoy.In cinema/ theatres right now.","

Musicals put to film always seem hard to pull off, and there are definitely some awkward moments that just don't translate well to film. But the cast was perfect. Renee Rapp was amazing.Once again though, I wish they would just film the actual stage performance. It seems this is what the majority of Broadway fans WANT so I'll never understand.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","vessinkaa","26 January 2024","It hasn't been long enough to justify making a remake simply because, although 20 years have passed, with the exception of social media, not that much has actually changed in the lives of a stereotypical high school girl. Everything about this movie was just a bit worse than the original which is a cult classic. The fashion felt misplaced - at times looked 90s at times early 2000s - just confusing. Changing characters races or names for the sake of it (no other reason)... also no hate here but the original Regina is skinny so when she eats all of the candy bars there is a significant change in her physical appearance - that's the joke the bars make you put on weight. There was pretty much NO DIFFERENCE in Regina's physical appearance before and after she ate the bars, she looks the same. The plastics wear trainers/jeans/baggy trousers which is against the rules. The whole thing with Regina giving Cady the heels made no sense since unlike the original The Plastics didn't dress with skinny mini skirts and heels. Every character was a stereotype without the deep multilayered finesse of the original cast. Just a big fat meh! Don't waste your time and watch the original!","

The mix of the songs is very subdued and weak - when everything needed to go big.I really don't like most of the cast. Cady actress was hiring solely on her resemblance to Amy Adams who they couldn't get so they had to settle on Jenna Fischer. Busy Philips was an annoying cliche. I really wasn't feeling the Aaron or Damian people either. I guess the Plastics were passable. And Janice.

Basically, sixteen-year-old Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) has been home-schooled and living in Kenya since she was a child. She and her zoologist mother (Jenna Fischer) move back to America, and Cady starts attending North Shore High School. Being naïve, Cady has an intimidating first day, struggling to fit in during classes and around the school's various cliques. She befriends outsiders Janis Ian (Moana's Auli'i Cravalho), who is lesbian, and Damian Hubbard (introducing Jaquel Spivey), who is gay, who help her to settle in. They explain about the cliques, and warn her to avoid the Plastics, a group of crude, beautiful, popular girls. The Plastics consist of wealthy but insecure Gretchen Wieners (Bebe Wood), sweet but unintelligent Karen Smith (Avantika), and ""queen bee"" leader Regina George (Reneé Rapp). Cady is invited to sit with the Plastics at lunch, and Janis, wanting to have some fun, persuades her to infiltrate them to learn their darkest secrets. In her calculus class, Cady becomes attracted to senior student Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), who is Regina's ex-boyfriend. At Regina's house, Cady learns about the Burn Book, a scrapbook the Plastics fill with cruel rumours about the students and the teachers. Regina tells Cady that she and Janis were once friends until she accused Janis of being a lesbian and ostracised her. Cady is invited to a Halloween house party, but she misunderstands the dress code, dressing as a scary zombie bride while most girls dress promiscuous. Regina offers to talk to Aaron on Cady's behalf, but instead, she kisses him in front of her and resumes their relationship. Feeling betrayed, Cady fully commits to Janis's plan to ruin Regina's life, so that she will lose her boyfriend, her beauty, and her friends. Cady, Janis and Damian try to sabotage Regina's reputation, but their attempts backfire and only increase her popularity. Cady, Janis, and Damian plan to turn Gretchen against her. They make it look like Regina has sent candy canes to Cady and Karen while excluding Gretchen. Regina's reputation takes a big hit after a disastrous performance at the annual Winter Talent Show. Gretchen accidentally reveals to Cady some of Regina's embarrassing secrets, including that she has been cheating on Aaron with football player Shane Oman (Brian Altemus). Aaron eventually catches her and breaks up with her. Cady then targets Regina's body, tricking her into eating nutrition bars that cause weight gain and using face cream containing lard. Finally, Regina breaks a code of the Plastics, she is banished, with Cady replacing her as the new ""queen bee."" Janis invites Cady to her art show, but Cady lies that she is travelling with her mother on a business trip. While her mother is away on the trip, Cady throws a house party; she drunkenly tells Aaron that she has been deliberately failing maths tests so that he will speak to her. But he scolds her for becoming manipulative and image-obsessed, like Regina. Janis and Damian confront Cady for not inviting them and accuse her of becoming like Regina. Cady angrily accuses Janis of being obsessed with her, and Janis declares she has become a Plastic and calls her a ""mean girl"", renouncing their friendship. Regina discovers Cady's betrayal and gets revenge by distributing the pages of the Burn Book throughout the school. A riot breaks out in the school as the students and teachers read the nasty comments written about them, and Regina avoids suspicion by inserting insults about herself, placing the blame on Cady, Gretchen, and Karen. To restore order, Principal Duvall (Tim Meadows) and math teacher Ms. Norbury (30 Rock's Tina Fey, also writing) gather the female students in the gymnasium to admit their feelings towards and apologise to each other. Regina insults Janis's sexuality, and Janis retaliates by revealing her entire plan to destroy Regina's life with Cady's help. Regina storms out, pursued by an apologetic Cady, and she is hit by a school bus, and she is put into a neck brace. Cady realises the damage the Burn Book has done and takes full responsibility for it. Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn extra credit by joining the school Mathletes at the state finals. Overseen by the moderator (Lindsay Lohan), Cady answers the tiebreaker correctly and her team wins the championship. The team arrives at the Spring Fling dance, where Cady is shocked to be crowned the Prom Queen. She uses the opportunity to apologise to everybody she hurt, declaring that everyone is wonderful in their own way. She snaps the plastic tiara and distributes pieces of it to other girls in the crowd, including Janis, Gretchen, and Regina. Cady rekindles her friendship with Janis and Damian, reaches a truce with the Plastics, and makes up with Aaron, and they kiss. Also starring Jon Hamm as Coach Carr, Busy Philipps as Mrs. George, Mahi Alam as Kevin Ganatra, Connor Ratliff as Mr. Rapp, Ashley Park (Gretchen in the stage musical) as Madame Park, and Megan Thee Stallion as herself. Rice does a pretty good job as the lead character navigating her place in school, Rapp is well cast as the ultimate beautiful backstabbing cow, busty Avantika and ditsy Wood are alright support, Spivey steals the show as the loveable camp companion, and the returns of Meadows and Fey as the same characters, and Lohan's cameo, are genius. The chick flick about Barbie-like young girls and the American teenage school experience fused with song-and-dance numbers sort of works, there are some catchy songs, the ones that stood out were ""Apex Predator"", ""Sexy"", ""Someone Gets Hurt"", ""Revenge Party"", and ""I'd Rather Be Me"". It just about maintains the same ugly behaviour and spitefulness, the script has been updated with the times and attitudes of today's world, I admit I much prefer the original as it is funnier, but this twist is not a bad musical teen comedy. Worth watching!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","tlkkel","4 March 2024","It wasnt awful in the sense it had a decent script and idea, high school social politics and pressures. And that would have helped carry iot if it wasnt a carboard cutout of the original except with mostly cheesy musical numbers woven in. And not a few. A LOT of cheesy musical numbers. They took away far more than they added. They at times seemed to wanna make a point, but it never pased a moment to reflect on anything musical (the characters were oblivious to their own random belting out of showtunes) so if there was any message in any of the music, it usually got pushed aside when the dialogue resumed.It was mostly just the original repeated, but at higher speed with lower impact and a few mostly bad songs thrown on top..","

"Mean Girls (2024)","exceladeogun","21 February 2024","Mean girls (2024)This musical teen comedy is a modern musical reimagining of the 2004 film with the same title. Arriving two decades after the original, a lot of changes are obviously expected, and this remake embraces the changes of the times while paying homage to the beloved classic.Even with the changes at play here, this remake doesn't best the culturally impactful original or match it. The performances here are mostly standard but not memorable, watching this remake will make you appreciate the efforts of the original mean girls. The costumes aren't exciting. The jokes also lack punch either from their delivery or writing.The biggest difference between both versions is that this one is a musical. As a musical, not every musical number here lands successfully; the lyrics aren't impressive and some melodies are forgettable. Some of the songs are present just to remind audiences that this is a musical and don't necessarily move the story forward, though Renée Rapp's musical performances stand out as delightful highlights.Overall, this remake retains enough of the original movie's essence to make it worth watching, but the changes could have been more finely tuned to truly make it 'fetch'.5/10.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","stevencayer","20 January 2024","I can't believe MEAN GIRLS actually came out 20 years ago. I just remember how big of a pop culture moment it was back then. It had so many lines that people probably still use today, like it's ingrained in my generation. This generation is now getting a seat at the cafeteria table, MEAN GIRLS is back, this time based on the 2018 musical. For all you youngsters out there, this tells the story of a home-schooled teenage girl Cady (Angourie Rice) who moves from Kenya to dive head-first into the wild jungle that is high-school society. I have recently watched both versions now and here are the differences. The most obvious is that this version is a musical, full of songs that express the characters' feelings. To me, songs from musicals these days aren't very memorable, and this is no different. I've seen so many musicals just in the past month, maybe too many. My favorite one is still ACROSS THE UNIVERSE. Anyway, I'm glad Tina Fey went back in the writer's chair and revised some outdated phrases and racist stereotypes that were in the original. This is the first movie directed by the team of Samantha Jane and Arturo Perez Jr, and I believe they did the original justice. The cast is very good, especially the queen bee with a capital B Regina George, played by Reneé Rapp. She actually played her in the Broadway musical, and I can definitely see why. I also really enjoyed some cameos. The message still resonates; Try not to lose sight of who you are. We're all just figuring it out together. Overall, I had fun with this generation's MEAN GIRLS, even though it's a musical. Fetch is happening again. You go Glen Coco!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","southdavid","24 January 2024","I have seen ""Mean Girls"" before, but I think only once and, as a middle-aged man, it doesn't hold any special place in my heart. I did go and see this movie, of the musical, of the movie, of the book though and, whilst my expectations weren't particular high, I quite enjoyed it.Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) transfers to an American High School, having previously lived in Kenya with her mother. She makes friends with Janis (Auli'I Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey) and they introduce her to the cliques and social structure of the school, which is ruled over by ""the plastics"" and their fearsome alpha leader Regina George (Renee Rapp). When the plastics offer Cady a chance to sit with them, Janis and Damian encourage her to go and report back on what they're like.Regardless of the origins, I generally quite like musicals and the songs in this one are excellent; memorable, witty and funny. They service the story wonderfully and there's regular meta gags that play with the form really well. They're also really well performed and choreographed. The acting performances are great too, with all the of principles great and elevating the material even more. Tina Fey and Tim Meadows reprise their roles from the original film. There's a great cameo from Busy Phillips as Regina's mother and another cameo, that I shouldn't spoil, later in the film that drew gasps from the audience in the screening I was in.I should say about that screening, that there were lots of young girls in there - preteens dragged by parents that I imagine were fans of the original film and I didn't think that the film was particularly suitable for them. There's nothing too bad, but I'd suggest that the content stretches the 12A certificate right to the very limit.I should tell you that my cool, aloof, cynicism stopped me from enjoying this one but, as I've gotten older, I'm finding that side of things increasingly tiresome. Give me a good time, and ""Mean Girls"" certainly is that.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","ethanbresnett","21 January 2024","It's not unexpected that Mean Girls doesn't reach the heights of its non-musical predecessor, but it's still a decently entertaining film even if it does feel a little redundant.There's probably not much point dwelling on the story as, barring a few minor updates and slight alterations in some of the finer details, it is the same as the 2004 film. It's a fun story just like the original so enough said on this point really.The real difference is of course the addition of the musical element, which for me just didn't quite work. None of the songs hit the mark in my opinion. I actually thought they were all very well staged and well performed, but they just weren't great songs. A bit of shame but thankfully the film does have the good story to fall back on so this wasn't as bad as it might otherwise have been.One of the real highlights is the performances, particularly Renee Rapp who truly shines as Regina George. When the role was so memorably played by Rachel McAdams it's a hard pair of shoes to fill, but she does it so well and is truly magnetic on screen. Angourie Rice is a little less convincing as Cady but still strong enough, and the rest of the plastics are spot on.Overall I think this film is perfectly decent. There are some great performances and the story speaks for itself, with a few updates giving it a bit of a new flavour. It's just a shame that the songs let it down slightly.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","kjproulx","27 January 2024","The Mean Girls story is one that I quite enjoy, but the first film from 2004 is my only real exposure. I never read the novel that the original film is based on, I never saw the musical stage production based on the film, but I was still very curious about that stage production being adapted into a feature film. While this version doesn't hold a candle to the original film, I can safely say that I had a good time with the 2024 update and it can stand on its own. The musical aspect worked very well for me and I think the cast is great. I have my complaints, but this version still worked for me overall. Let's dive in.The story is the same as always. Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) moves to a new town and befriends a group of popular girls at school known as the ""Plastics."" Not everything is sunshine and rainbows though once their leader, Regina George (Reneé Rapp) finds out that Cady is interested in her ex-boyfriend Aaron (Christopher Briney). While she acts like these girls and constantly hangs out with them, her true friends are actually Janis 'lmi'ike (Auli'i Cravalho) and Damian Hubbard (Jaquel Spivey). They are the true heart and soul of this film and I think Cravalho steals the show as Janis on multiple occasions.As for the musical aspect, there are quite a few numbers and I can appreciate a good musical, so that doesn't bother me in the least, but I wouldn't exactly say the songs are super memorable. Yes, the way they are performed is fantastic, it's just that only about one or two stood out to me as great. Reneé Rapp is the only cast member to return to their character after performing on stage, and while she is a great performer musically, I did think there was something left to be desired in the smaller moments of the film. In fact, my favourite character in The Plastics was actually Karen (Avantika) this time around. I thought she played the bumbling dumb person hilarious well.The 2024 Mean Girls (aside from being a musical) also doesn't do too much for the story to separate itself from the original. All of the same story beats are hit and even some of the cast returns. It was great to see Tina Fey and Tim Meadows once again, but I feel that since the original film existed and then was already adapted into a stage musical, not much originality was present here. Still, I have to admit that I just like the overall story and this was a great cast, so I had a good time. Mean Girls is now playing in theatres and I recommend checking it out, especially if you like the original film and don't mind musicals.","

The end of the movie felt like it came really quickly which was a sign that I was having a really good time! I imagine it was helpful that I wasn't comparing it to the original or musical. The last time I saw the original movie was over 10 years ago, so I didn't remember much. I've listened to the musical soundtrack a couple of times, but not enough to know it well for comparison. That meant on its own the film stood up well. I had a fun time laughing and enjoying the music and staging.I thought all the actors/singers did a great job, (although kind of wished Angourie had belted a bit more.

Loved Renee's cool hip take on Regina, rest of the cast is great as well.People will never stop comparing this to the original which is to be expected, this is not a by the book remake of it or the Broadway show, neither a reboot, think of it more like a fresh reimagining of both updated for modern audiences.

This is simply a sad attempt to placate the youth so they don't have to go search for or look up anything while cramming the entire gambit of ""liberal diversity"" down everyone's throats.

I have the original script memorized in my head so it was refreshing to see this one adapted a little differently and constructed to feel more modern. The delivery of the lines sometimes felt uncomfortable to watch that irks me (a little), perhaps a bit forced too just to fit the Gen-Z culture.What's lacking is the character development that most of it felt rushed even though the film felt so long to watch. Most of the musicals I have watched (Hairspray, for example) had always given character developments where the audience can further analyze on each character with the way they personality shifts in every act. This Mean Girls film did not represent that very well. I didn't see much bond from Regina and Cady so when Regina finally cut off that photo of theirs, it felt unnatural.Loved Auli'i Cravalho and Reneé Rapp's performances- I thought they were the best especially through their singing. Bebe Wood is an immediate favorite; her presence on-screen was natural.","

It also further perpetuates stereotypes that need to be permanently laid to rest, this movie was a waste of time and money, the lyrics were hard to understand for lack of enunciation it just sounded like a mix of overused riffs.

As a brilliant combination of the 2004 movie and the Broadway musical, this film is stunning, entertaining and the perfect movie to start the New Year!Mean Girls borrows the same storyline as the original film, with plenty of plot twists. The film is presented as a story narrated by Janice (Auli'i Cravalho) and Damien (Jaquel Spivey). It follows Cady Heron (Angourie Rice), a new student at North Shore High School who moved to the US from Kenya. She makes friends with Janice and Damien, and eventually crosses paths with Regina George (Reneé Rapp), Gretchen Weiners (Bebe Wood) and Karen Shetty (Avantika), also known as ""The Plastics."" When Cady is sent to spy on The Plastics by Janice and Damien, it sets off a series of chain reactions including drama, betrayal, and getting hit by a bus.Fans of both the original Mean Girls movie and the Mean Girls Broadway musical will not be disappointed. My favorite song was ""Someone Gets Hurt"" sung by Renee Rapp. From her gorgeous vocals and the beautiful scenery, this performance is so mesmerizing that it could have been a stand-alone music video. I love that they include other songs from the Broadway show like ""Apex Predator"" and ""Revenge Party"" as well as new ones. I also love the special cameo appearances and newly discovered facts about the original characters; both of which really add depth to the film. I love how the movie includes things like social media and other references to things unavailable in 2004. I watched this film in theaters and there were so many places where I just wanted to pause or rewind it because they were so mind blowing. This is a movie I would love to see again!The film's message is to be yourself and not get caught up with the wrong people. Cady was so fed up of ""living the life"" with The Plastics that she betrays her true friends and loses the smart and sweet girl she originally was. Parents should be aware that there is foul language as well as suggestive topics and special effects that are so realistic they will make you gasp.I give Mean Girls 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to18, plus adults. Be sure to watch after the credits for a very short post credits scene. Be sure to check out Mean Girls in theaters now! By Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!","

Reneé Rapp is the new Regina George. Angourie Rice takes over from Lindsay Lohan.I really like the original and its great writing. This seems to be written for the TikTok generation and I feel old. More than that, I feel tired from watching it. My first thought is superficial. The 'kids' are in their late 20's. I'm fine with Reneé Rapp. Regina can be older and Rapp has a history with the musical. Angourie looks the youngest and she's in her early twenties. Worst of all, the background actors are looking professional. I get the need for Broadway dance veterans, but it doesn't look good on the screen.As for the songs, they are plot-based and very Broadway. There isn't a top 40 hit in the bunch. There are minor adjustments in the story. I'm fine with most of them. The bus actually works better in this one. The burn book outing is better. Janis goes into more detail in her situation and that makes Cady less appealing. The movie is like reworking a band's greatest hit. There is no need to follow the story since it's mostly like the original anyways. The original is a classic and this one is a loud singy copy.","

There are other actors that deserve some Credit as well, like the one that plays damian and the one that plays janis. Loved that they há more screen time and the writers used it very well. The other plastics also did a great job and the wardrobe for them was way better. My only reservations honestly were with cady and aaron. Didnt really liked that aaron in a fair comparaison with the one from the 2004 movie. The cady is boring in the first half of the movie and then she starts to became more interesting from there, but yet nothing like our lindsayRenee carry the movie but she had help and overall is very fun to watch.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","bahar_mod2004","15 January 2024","I don't know why it had to be a musical but it was really really bad. Some of the characters were tolerable but overall the movie was hard to get through. Regina was probably the worst one, maybe just because her songs were terrible and just didn't sound right. I wish they'd made some other kind of change as part of doing a remake, and maybe the idea of a musical version sounds good but it just felt like the songs were forced. Janis and Karen's characters were the best I think, especially Janis who I think had the best singing and acting in the whole movie. Other than that, I can't say anything positive about it.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","njhfprk","6 February 2024","This movie should be call ""not nice girls."" It's not about girls being toxic like the original, it's about girls being a little catty. So viewers beware! This movie made me want to gag. Being PC and having good ideals is a great thing but not in a mean girls movie because that's not what it's about. It's about girls being toxic and judging everyone, else not ""oh body positivity guys!"" ""Let's connect with the youth!"" It's actually so gross
And what the hell did y'all do to Janice! She actually looked like someone who would be an outsider in the old movie, in this one she just looks bad!Never ruin a beautiful franchise again!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","lisafordeay","17 February 2024","Mean Girls(2024)is a remake of the 2004 movie of the same name but with singing added to the mix.The story is pretty much like the original one but with a few minor changes.A transfer student named Cady Heron from Kenya (Angourie Rice replacing Lindsay Lohan in the original one) is attending high school where she befriends a group of popular girls called ""The Plastics,"" ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp replacing Rachel McAdams) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood replacing Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Avantika replacing Amanda Seyfried).However Cady ends up falling for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney replacing Jonathan Bennett), which causes problems. As Cady sets to take down Regina with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli'i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself.Overall it wasn't a bad film. The songs come out of nowhere, they turned Regina from being two faced to being sultry,and there is alot of awkward closeups. Also features Tina Fey,Tim Meadows and a surprise cameo by Cady Heron herself Lindsay Lohan who all appeared in the original film.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","judealexharnett","5 February 2024","To be honest I really expected to dislike this movi3 but the clips circulating the Internet and the trailer didn't do this movie justice. I thought it was quite good, well certain aspects anyway. A good lot of the songs were actually pretty good. The characters were all really likable and I think i burst out laughing a couple times.Regina George was super duper hot so that was a massive plus. Unfortunately, no hate to angourie rice, but a lot of her singing was really bad and really quite off putting, but reneè rapp was phenomenal. Also in my opinion the ending was a bit rushed and definitely could have been done better. 7.5/10.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","troy-boulton","22 January 2024","It's a reboot. It's a musical. Is it plastic fantastic? Maybe.It's 2024 and a new generation of it-girl plastics are ruling the roost. Except in the age of socials, rather than dominating the halls, it appears the queens of the moment have to satisfy themselves with being legends on their own screens. The musical aspects are a fun new (ish) direction, but it seems the recycling process takes the edge off our rehashed polymer pretties. Are gen zalpha soft? Have our PC sensibilities made our hard drives go floppy? Or has Tina Fey just lost the nerve to sharpen her claws in her sixth decade? Probably a bit of all the above. We live in different times, and this iteration of the plastic fantastic go heavy on the back-references and plays on in jokes, pulling their punches in preference of froth and uplift.The film is fun, and watchable to the end, but it is a different beast. This is most certainly not your mother's Mean Girls. And it clearly never intended to be. It's softer it's cuddlier. It's cuter. The monster teeth are definitely fake, and they're discarded almost as quickly as the book of burn.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Groverdox","29 February 2024","You know, I was just asking myself that eternal question: how do the people who make movie trailers have a better idea of the kind of movies people want to see, than the people who make the movies the trailers are from?I mean, the trailer for ""Madame Web"" was so good I almost watched the movie, but luckily I was warned against it.Nobody warned me about this ""Mean Girls"" remake though. And it's a classic example of a movie with a lying trailer. I mean, did you know this remake is a musical? I didn't. None of the previews showed a second of that.I see you, trailer-making people. You know what we want to see. You know most of us wouldn't have wasted our time if we knew we were going to have to sit through a movie in which at any moment the characters threaten to break into song.And of course, the songs all suck and are completely forgettable.Take away the songs, and what we're left with is a bloodless copy of the original movie, with actors left looking like they're holding the ball when the time to pass was five seconds ago. They look startled, like they don't know what they're doing there. At times, they intone classic lines from the original movie, but without any of the panache, and the words fall as flat as the song lyrics do.I feel bad for the actors. They were never going to be anything better than impostors. The movie seems to be doing well at the box office, so here's hoping it doesn't tank their careers, particularly Angourie Rice and Avantika.Tina Fey, on the other hand, should have known better.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","deleyshaun","6 February 2024","A musical that's worth it's salt has a seamless balance between a story and the musical items. This did not. It was a jarring, bumpy road. It was like it didn't know wether to appease people who wanted a straight remake or to do what it was supposed to- a film take on the broadway musical. The second sin committed was the musical items were no good and the actors weren't up to it. So what's left? Also the casting was pretty poor too. Another problem was it had less emphasis on the plastics - which is ok but it didn't work. Anyone knows what made the original strong was Regina George and the plastics. This may not be the best message but I'm not here to judge morality but film quality. On a positive- there were a few nice throwbacks to 2004 and I didn't mind the modern take on the jokes of the original. Overall a big dissapointment. Just sit home and rewatch the original. Just another reminder of how good it was.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","crossy1794","2 March 2024","Where do I start? The original is my favorite chick flick and I've seen it a million times as most girls have.My first problem with the movie, was the lyrics from the songs. I understand the movie is not that deep and doesn't need complex lyrics, but it was like they were written by edgy 13 year olds. My boyfriend caught two glimpses of the songs and asked me ""what the f are you watching?"".Secondly, the acting. Cady(Angourie) was kinda decent, but my biggest problem was Regina(Renee). Although she has an outstanding voice and her acting was quite ok, she didn't give original Regina vibes. I understand that this movie is supposed to be something new but let's be honest. It's a remake. All the actors tried to copy the previous actors from the original. Renee failed dramatically for me. Rachel McAdams in the original was perfect because she was a total mean girl but still charmed everyone because she could fake being so sweet and innocent. Renee was just mean and a total b**** to everyone. In real life nobody would worship her. She was hysterical all the time. I just wanted to slap her. Janis was decent with an amazing voice, Damian really funny but Karen(Avantika)? A big no! The worst of them all! I feel like somebody told Avantika to copy Amanda Seyfried if she had a lobotomy. Such bad acting. Amanda Seyfried in the original was perfect! Her acting was so good, that made you think she was actually dumb. Avantika seemed like she wanted to look dumb to people and just acted cringy all the time. Her only characteristic was that she has slept with a lot of people. Nice addition guys. Gretchen honestly was similar to the original one.Third and last, the screenplay. They tried to fit all the songs in the movie, so they cut many important (to me) details. They cut phrases in half so the movie lost a lot of its meaning and essence. Also they merged scenes or left some off completely. The actors were speaking sometimes fast, so the scene would be smaller with no emotion.They shouldn't have done that. If they wanted something original, they should have made a new mean girls movie, like they tried in mean girls 2 but of course with better screenwriting and better actors. I didn't have big hopes for this one and unfortunately I was right.","

And as a musical to boot.I only stayed to see just how bad the this movie could get, and not only was it bad, it was terribly boring, which is a greater insult.

"Mean Girls (2024)","hncddhtxw","14 January 2024","I'll start by saying, this is not a ""remake"" remake. At least, I didn't take it to be. It is MEAN GIRLS 2004 at its core, simply updated in ways that ""slap"", as the kids who will flock to it most might say.There are clear differences between the original and this update- namely the musical aspect, which is a very YMMV situation. As a person who often doesn't like the 'cheese' of musicals, I'll admit that this one was a pleasure to sit through, even if the songwriters missed the mark by making Cady sing about not being good at ""love"". The song would have been broadly more relatable to showcase her awkward interactions in class with Aaron about not being good at ""life"". Cady had trouble navigating American High School culture and the friendships there as much, if not more, than her love life- so this felt like a mark missed, for a movie where the main course is rooted in self-acceptance via figuring out what it means to be a good friend and force for good, with a side of crush content.But more notably, there are other important aspects that make it just a conscientious update to the 2004 film. To just mention two, and not give the film away:Firstly, it's an update for the heightened inclusion that is woven effortlessly throughout the script, which was merely more than a hint in the original due to coming about at a time when our society only had one state (Massachusetts) that recognized gay marriage in 2004, and still fights for women to be valued as more than being receptacles for pleasure or hosts for reproduction. The 2004 film brought gay characters onto the horizon in what was a palatable-for-the-time way to family audiences, when gay characters represented on screen in works geared toward teens and pre-teens and their families was still several years from commonplace. There is no shade to be cast on the actors in he 2004 film for this; it is matter-of-fact for the time, and the actors back then did an amazing job bringing to life what it was to experience high school when many kids still didn't know what ""gay"" meant. In two words: Representation matters. The update brings these integral characters in the film out in front of audiences- proudly- and is made better for it. Our 2004 Janis and Damien were every bit the Janis and Damien we needed and wanted, and they ran so our 2024 Janis and Damien could run.Second, there are updates to the language used in the film that honors how far we've come as a society in two decades, even if we do have some distance yet to go. In one instance, rather than Regina George writing of herself in the Burn Book that she is a ""Fugly Sl*t"", she uses another word to replace the one previously reserved for weaponizing against women to make them ashamed of their sexuality. And in a similar acknowledgment that words matter for the way people might be perceived through descriptions, Principal Duvall doesn't state with frustration when the girls go wild that, ""... I did NOT leave the south side for THIS!"". This line to reflect his frustration changes to correct one that, in 2004, was at the time, unknowingly- if not at least unintentionally- steeped in classist, racist ideas that shame people for being born into a race, place, or circumstance that they have no power to influence. When you know better, you're *supposed* to do better- and this was a much-needed update to the script that, while noted, didn't seem out of place (they gave it a very applicable update, which educators or anyone who's underpaid in employment can relate), or make you miss the original.My rating reflects that I think this update would have stood stronger if it had not been done in a stage-to-screen musical, and utilized the scene breaks spent singing to build a little more on some of the supporting characters. For example, we learn in the update more about Gretchen's ethnic background, which could have been more interesting woven into as a conversation between Cady and Gretchen... just mentioning it briefly without any further discussion at all in the film felt like the film trying to ensure something that, without follow up, it just does not.This film stands separate and apart from the original made in 2004. I have a hard time thinking ""remake"" about it, because while it obviously follows the same script it definitely serves up some pertinent improvements that reflect how social norms change- and prove that change is Ok to embrace, even when (or maybe especially when) we think that we don't need it.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","dollywinkster","21 February 2024","I'm going to keep it as short and simple as I can. I already knew that this movie was going to be a musical and I am open minded to new takes. They took a very interesting direction to take an original movie and remake it in a way that is modern to todays teenage society especially with the whole social media being the most important platform in today's society.I love love love Renee as Regina she really captures a true mean girl reminds me of Regina from the 2004 version. Damon and Janis really portrayed their characters very well. Majority of the cast were pretty good at acting but I feel Cady was a bit lacklustre in her character. I feel that Karen's character was also disappointing.As for the whole direction of the movie and flow it's pretty much adding the iconic lines and changing it in the way that 35mins in we already have 3 or 4 scenes worth of those iconic lines that was used in the original in one scene. They reworked the writing and scenes but still kept the original style which is not bad. They did make some silly random comments which made no sense and wasn't really funny. But everyone's humour is different. :)If we talk about the musical side to it. Cady's singing parts were a bit unnecessary and felt a bit awkward. There was one scene I liked which is to do with Regina walking outside of the school. Janis and Damon singing throughout was really good. Karen's Tiktok number when they are getting ready for Halloween was actually catchy. Every single song that Regina sang was amazing. She is the true star of the movie.Overall, this movie is actually not bad as people are making it out to be. Yes, a lot of people think its pointless doing a remake of an iconic classic movie and making it a musical but the direction of how this movie was directed was actually done well.Would I recommend it?Yes if you like musicals and loved the original classic you would actually enjoy this movie.Would I say it's just as good as the original?You can never ever beat an original. Let alone it was written by the same writer as the original version. So I am sure Tina Fey knows her own movie very very well to make a musical out of it instead of recreating a garbage Mean Girls 2.0.","

I'm not familiar with the Broadway show so maybe this was for fans of that. To me, it was too much. The song and dance routines were too overstimulating. Too much going on with the background dancers. It seemed like there were just too many especially most of the songs done at the school. If they had cut that down to about half the teenagers I think that would've been better.I can see how this would translate better on the stage instead of the screen. I saw it with other Gen X ladies and we had some laughs. We all noticed the ""Plastics"" were built nothing like real teenage girls lol.I was pleased to see the cameo of Lindsey Lohan. And the girl ""who didn't even go to that school"" made me laugh the hardest. She did her part perfectly.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","irisirenie","30 January 2024","I went into this movie know it was not a remake, it was different, and knowing it was a musical. I have heard all good things from friends who have seen it, but I didn't like it. The acting was all over the top and cringey. The main characters (Cady, Janis, Damien, Regina, Gretchen and Karen) were all more talented at singing that they were at acting. Many of the songs were not necessary, didn't enhance the plot, and came out of nowhere. I didn't like the actress who played Regina (Renee Rapp) and I feel as though her take on the character was not right for the film. The actresses who played Karen (Avantika) and Gretchen (Bebe Wood) were both good but overshadowed by Regina (in regards to screen time and storyline) a lot more than they should have been, likely because Rapp is very popular among my generation (Generation Z). She was a lot taller than the other characters (due to height and high heels), which I think was to show she is basically in charge, but it didn't really work, it felt messy. Angourie Rice played Cady Heron in a sort of way that didn't really make sense in the story, as well as the fact it was done in a cringey way. Auli'i Cravalho and Jaquel Spivey were very good together as Janis and Damien. The returning actors of Tina Fey and Tim Meadows were highlights, and it was great to see a cameo from Lindsay Lohan.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Molly_flower","10 February 2024","Not to sound patronising at all, but I feel like this explanation is a good thing to keep in mind before watching this version of Mean Girls, which made it enjoyable for me. As soon as the movie stated I hated it, I wanted to walk about and wondered why I even thought it would be a good idea to watch this, considering the original is so iconic. Then after about 15 mins into the movie it clicked, this movie is just a harmless musical version - but on film. When I go to the theatre and watch a play or a musical that is based on a hit movie then it's usually an enjoyable experience being reminded of favourite scenes of the movie and sassy one-liners that were all supposed to laugh at together. That's all this movie was, its not trying to replace or upgrade the original. After I thought about that 10-15 mins into my viewing, I actually enjoyed it a lot more. And the actress playing Regina George SMASHED it, she was a great choice of casting!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","akoaytao1234","21 February 2024","PREFACE: Have not watched the original musical though have some memory of the original FILM.Its fine. I have a lot of issues with the writing in this one. The pivot towards Damian and Janis as the narrator over Cady really removed a lot of the reason the original film is very remembered. Its that a mean girl takes another mean girl to make one AND even those below the pyramid are equally ready to be mean to get a rise. It kinda tries to absolve Janis from the shenanigan and fault Cady for her want to be a plastic. This change in narration, doubles down on the already on nose message of the film. Its a subtlety nightmare. The music too is not that memorable.Acting wise, everyone can't act, though half of the fault here is the writing which tries hard to make a point that they make callbacks to the original. The other half is the actors just shockingly being forgettable. You kinda appreciate the original actors since they are natural scene stealers AND they pop off. Only Avantika and Auli'i Cravalho have that quality on them. Avantika just glistens when she's on screen - even with her wonky timing AND while I have issue with how they handled Auli'i's character, she shines when given a chance to sing her hearts out. Everyone here fades in the background, and shockingly even the much hyped Renee Rapp (who felt very uncomfortable for much of the watch).Overall, I think I am a bit more critical that average but I think its a good enough supplement if you are a huge fan of the original (I did not care for it even then) . Though this is totally unnecessary and lesser musical re-imagining.","

I thought it was a film that could easily be transformed into a musical and I was right. The songs fit in well and mesh with the story very well. It also helps that pretty much the whole cast are amazing singers and with power-house vocals like Reneé Rapp and Auli'i Cravalho the songs really shone and were enjoyable. Speaking of I found Rapp and Cravalho were the standouts of the movie with them dominating every scene they were in. Rapp in particular was amazing and I can't wait to see more of her in the future. I hadn't heard of her before this film and am now a very enthusiastic fan. I did think Cady and Aaron fell a little flat but to be fair compared to all the other characters they are the most boring so I think that was inevitable. Overall a fun adaptation that is of course not as good as the original but offers fun songs, an incredible Regina and a more progressive take.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","BCPro","21 February 2024","After seeing multiple clips off TikTok on how comically bad this was I decided to watch because of Renee Rapp and how talented her voice is. Had no idea who she was but I liked her look and voice. This movie was actually pretty good and I enjoyed it. You could notice they rewrote in relationships and made it more LGBTQ friendly which is something they rarely did in the early 2000s when the original was made. I liked how modern things were and how it was less dramatic and ""white girl"" drama like the original. There were references to different cultures and a diverse cast. I'm sure there will be people upset about that since it affects the stereotypes the original had with OG plastics. I liked the little costume references to euphoria and the set design. My two biggest issues I had with this movie was it was too focused on Janice and Damien. I believe it was supposed to be but at one point I think they had more songs than the plastics. The other issue was the casting of Cady. She could not sing very well and had zero expression or energy when she became the new ""it"" girl. I think she needed more training but I did like parts of her character. Overall it was a fun movie that will probably be put on Netflix in the next year or two. I definitely would rewatch and I'm sure in another 10-20 yrs there will be a reboot.","

They had so much fun with it and you can tell that they didn't need a lot of direction as this comes naturally. The reactions from cast and crew felt like a GCSE drama piece but the dancing was fantastic. I'm a massive theatre fan but this was the only movie musical I found myself begging them to stop singing (apart from Renee and Auli'l)I don't know where Angourie Rice was pulling that Cady Herron from but what a snoozefest, I found her flat, boring and just uninteresting to watch.

I enjoyed the cameos and star-studded cast, even those who were not in it for very long. I was definitely laughing out loud and I love that there were new jokes along with the traditional ones! The choreography and dancing were awesome. There was obviously a lot cut out from the musical, for obvious reasons, but I think the movie could have benefitted from being just a little longer. Plus, it felt too diluted and blatantly censored in ways that could have otherwise better developed the characters and plot. But, overall it was still better than expected.","

No one breaks out into singing or dancing in real life so there's no way to make it feel natural. The dancing may seem strange but that's literally the whole point and if your don't like it and it ruins the movie for you then that means the movies not for you.Highlights:
the cast was great. No complaints. Everyone killed itthe script. I felt had a nice balance of being modren and using/ making fun of gen z slang and culture without being too overt or annoyingComplaints:
the whole fat shaming plot is not enjoyable but I won't critic this film for that as it's a product of the script from the original movieThere was one moment where Catie holds the camera strangely and its off-putting, and there are other wierd little scenes like that but overall I really feel like those bits add to the character of the movie. This is a movie that I want to be able to make of and laugh at with my friends well also being genuinely entertaining and the movie excellently succeeded at doing that.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","matthewreinink","10 March 2024","As far as remakes go this one is pretty bad. The musical aspect just does not work on any level. The songs are horrible and a drag to sit through. You can't make a musical with songs this bland and boring. Although a lot of the cast is relatively unknown, I do believe they do a good job at mimicking the characters from the original. Cady, Regina, Karen, Gretchen, Janis, and Damian are all well acted in my opinion. I actually don't have many problems with this movie outside of the awful songs. But they really ruin it.The more I thought about it the more I respect this movie despite how bad it is. In a world where soulless cash grab remakes are 50% of Hollywood's output, this movie is much more bold than those other films. You have to give it credit, they tried something outside the box when they could have filled theaters with a scene for scene remake.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","duckykels","3 February 2024","This movie was just not needed. The original mean girls is still so iconic and popular, that a newer and musical version has too high standards to meet! Standards that it didn't meet. Whilst there were funny moments and it was an easy film to watch, the script was pretty much reused. They delivered the same iconic lines that the film is known for, in a more cringe and predictable way. However, I think that Renee Rapp did an amazing job at her role as Regina George. Her singing and musical numbers have had the most attention online and she does portray Regina very well. Overall, I think this movie is worth seeing only to laugh and cringe with your friends in theatres. If you are looking for a genuinely good two hours of cinema, then maybe steer clear of this one.","

I appreciate its not a classic, but a couple of hours, switch off, relax, enjoy. Not everything has to be groundbreaking and a comment on the human condition. Its okay to just enjoy the show, boo at the baddies and cheer for the good guys.I'm not a musical fan usually, and the people I was with are, and they didn't really like it.

"Mean Girls (2024)","joavabra","13 January 2024","I came into this movie as a Mean Girls connoisseur. I've been in love with the original movie since middle school, saw the Broadway show on tour, and was in the show at a local theatre this summer. I'm going to start with the most divisive part: the music. In short, it was bad. Not to say the music in the show is anything spectacular, but it's catchy and fits the overall campy tone of the show. In the movie, a majority of the songs were toned down in order to appeal to a more general audience. This really weakened the film. The biggest example of this was Stupid With Love. On stage, it's played as an upbeat, comedic number. But here, it almost takes itself too seriously. It would've had the same effect if they played a Billie Eilish song over the scene of Cady obsessing over Aaron. The only time the music truly worked in the film was when it was almost identical to the stage versions, in songs like Sexy, Someone Gets Hurt, and World Burn. They were fun and showcased Renee and Avantika's voices nicely, almost too nicely as Angourie's meek and lazy voice sounded weak in comparison. Deciding to cast actors who have never sung next to broadway alum was certainly a choice. Other than the music, the script was almost identical to that of the stage show. We've all known that Renee can play this part and play it well, and everything she did is what I've seen on slime tutorials on youtube so no notes there. Avantika as Karen and Jaquel Spivey as Damian were the standouts of the main cast. They both did something new with their characters and made me laugh out loud more than anyone else in the film. I see this as a breakout role for the both of them. Nevertheless, all of the leads held their own and most issues with the film were with production and story. As a fan of the musical and original movie, I would say this is my least favorite of the three. But it does hold its own and I hope it does it's job at introducing wider audiences to modern musical theatre.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","davemavericks","3 February 2024","Let me start off by saying I knew this was going to be a musical adaptation. With that being said let's get to this review....
The movie served its purpose and required no thinking and was just a fun time all throughout. Most of the songs drive the story especially the scene where Gretchen (Bebe woods) sung her song what's wrong with me? Brought me to tears, when she looked at the music box and regina (Renee Rapp) yelled at her to return. She then proceeds to play the music box one last time and finish her song. Her character does stand out as one of the stronger characters. It would have. Got a higher rating if she got more screen time.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","TomTalksFilms","22 January 2024","2024 marks 20 years since the original Mean Girls hit cinemas and touched the hearts of teenagers everywhere. I unfortunately would have been 4 at the time and only got around to watching the original film in the last couple of years. Watching the film as someone in their early 20's meant it didn't hit the same spot that it clearly did for teens in the early 2000's but I can definitely appreciate why it was so successful.The big difference between the original film and the new film is that the new film is a musical I believe based on the stage musical of the same name. Also written by Tina Fey, it's again a story of finding yourself and your place amongst your peers during the high school/secondary school years.Firstly being that it's a musical it seems appropriate to start by discussing the music. I personally am a big fan of musicals in general I do however think their is a lot of competition in the musicals set within high school sub genre. My personal favourites are the likes of Heathers and Dear Evan Hansen. Mean girls didn't come close to those for me however it certainly wasn't bad. A couple of songs 'Stupid with love' and 'I'd rather be me' stuck out most on a first watch/listen and I'll be interested to see whether I gain a liking for any of the other songs after more listens.The comedy is pretty much exactly the sort of humour you would expect if you know anything about Mean Girls or high school films. As someone in my 20's this is where the film faltered most for me, I definitely smirked a couple of times but there were no big laughs for me. The film is also very post modern/self aware so if you like that kind of humour or are a fan of the original film I'm sure you'll enjoy those references.Overall it was an enjoyable near 2 hours on first watch/listen but isn't one I'm going to be going back to time and time again like I do with the likes of Heathers etc...","

"Mean Girls (2024)","keegankennedy-73366","14 January 2024","This movie is about as mediocre as it gets. I love the original Mean Girls (2004), and the musical is fun though not a masterpiece. But this remake was largely bland and devoid of personality outside of a few characters - specifically Damion, Karen, and Gretchen.The musical arrangement bothered me and didn't work to advance the story for most of the songs. Whether this was because Rice (Cady) isn't vocally strong enough to play such a vocally demanding part in a musical or they were going for a different style...it just felt consistently flat. Regina (Rapp) has a great voice which salvaged some of the musical storytelling, didn't love her acting and she won't be winning any awards for this role, but she carried the movie musically.My biggest issue with the movie was that compared to the original and the musical, it wasn't funny. Was it fun? Sure, at points. Did I have a bad time? Not at all (aside from cutting 'It Roars' which is my favorite song from the musical). I understand that a lot of the jokes in the original might be too extreme or insensitive, but if this is supposed to be a comedy it certainly didn't make me, or seemingly anyone in the movie theatre I was in, laugh. Seeing it once was more than enough for me.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","UnderTheScene","28 January 2024","Talk about a disappointment. For a film based off a broadway show, it should've stayed on the stage. From acting not being great, to majority of the musical numbers not hitting this was a painful 1 hour and 52 minutes. A lot of the time it felt like I was watching music videos more than a film, which threw me off. A few pros that come from this version of Mean Girls was Damian(Jaquel Spivey) who was great in this and Reneé Rapp playing a decent Regina George, but no where near as good as Rachel McAdams. Honestly Jon Hamm should've been utilized more, as he was the best addition to the cast by far. At least they kept the classic lines from the original film.Overall this was a disappointing reboot/remake and the few good points could not save this from a low rating sadly.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","cosby_don","16 January 2024","I had originally paid for The Hunger Games, but walked out after the first 15 minutes, which were incredibly boring. So me and my daughter changed to see Mean Girls and ... meh. I wasn't really impressed. I don't know if it's cause I'm older now or what but teen comedy movies just don't hit as hard as they used to. Yes, that makes since!This movie could've been much funnier. The acting was ok. The direction was ... only satisfactory. I grew up watching She's All That, Not Another Teen Movie, and any Jennifer Love Hewitt teen movie cause she was hot. THOSE were well casted, acted, directed, and written.This one just isn't that memorable, and here's why:1. The lead actress is no Lindsay Lohan. I was in HS when the first Mean Girls came out and I though Lindsay was smoking hot. Hey, I'm Black and from Los Angeles so I didn't grow up around White girls. She was pretty and had nice ... body parts. She acted well, as well, and had a gravitas. This lead actress, she did ok, but ... it wasn't the same.2. The comedic bits weren't all there. The first Mean Girls had tons of comedy. Here, I think I laughed out loud one time (I forgot the joke) and there were other funny moments but not as much as the original. Comedies are supposed to be FUNNY.3. I'm too tired to keep writing lol sorry.","

Musicals and movies when combined often don't ring the magic they entail on their own. Yet here we have Mean Girls: The Musical which is filled with magic through and through.From start to finish I was grooving along to familiar broadway tunes given an edgy pop twist and loudly laughing to many a joke both familiar and new. What made the rendition so brilliant was a clear mark to be its own unique movie not exactly like the first, particularly through its current day setting; an age rife with technology and social media not seen 20 years ago.This is a must see for Mean Girl fans and newbies alike, as all will be left smiling from ear to ear with a piece of plastic tiara in hand.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","adamlovecopy","14 January 2024","Wow. I wasn't expecting much, but this was so horrible and so unnecessary. The girl who plays Cady should've never been cast, she sings flatter than the mom in Stepbrothers during her Range Rover solo of ""Sweet Child O'Mine."" And it's literally the same script, but shorter, with interjected and forgettable songs. Even Tina Fey seems checked out as Norbury and it's her damn movie. The guy who plays Damian is a convincing copy, but derivative nonetheless. The only saving grace (somewhat) is Renee Rapp's belting pipes and her sharper, more shrew approach to Regina George: she's absolutely fabulous and sets a high water mark. The same can be said for whoever plays her mom: it's almost inconceivable to play a character Amy P slayed and make it your own, but she does seamlessly. Unfortunately, neither are in the movie long enough to make up for the rest of the flat, uninspired performances (Janice, Karen, and Gretchen are all so flat, over-the-top, and simultaneously unfunny). The one new laugh comes from Kevin G. Delivering the only well-timed (and new) line of dialogue at the end. Yikes. Save yourself the money and time. Two hours has gone by faster for me getting my teeth drilled. This thing was so poorly-written and acted and so superfluous, I questioned whether or not it was commissioned by the Eric Cartman version of Kathleen Kennedy.","

To me it's more like seeing a play you enjoy performed with different actors. If you enjoyed the original it seems natural to enjoy it in different forms.

The mean girls characters aren't likable and they look older. The new Regina George has nothing on Rachel McAdams. It's like she was out of place. And the singing. They completely lost me at the singing. If you want to make a bad movie worse, add bad singing. It was just so unnecessary to remake this.

But when you rewatch the original you'll see just how many jokes and plot points are copied. Hell even the script in a lot of scenes are the exact same just with normal dialogue to progress the story. It's still a good script but it's the same bs we get for live-action Disney remakes.With that being said, the songs were actually some of the best parts of the movie. I mean most of the songs themselves weren't anything too special but visually and the choreography were so fun with great visual comedy. I will also admit that I found some aspects a bit more enjoyable like some jokes were just funnier and the over the top satire was also solid.Also a nitpick but why literally say what the message of the movie is at the very end. We just watched the full 1 hour and 45 minute movie how dumb do they think the audience is that they have to sum up the entire meaning of the film??So I guess I still ""like"" this movie to an extent but oof it's just the original with a different cast, songs, modern use of social media and a stronger sense of self awareness.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","pehopkins","9 March 2024","Obviously the OG was superior, but they still pretty much followed the same storyline. I do feel that some of the scenes were rushed and the acting was poor and awkward! Maybe that's just because I know the OG dialogue by heart, and I was expecting certain things to be said or done that were not. I do like that they brought Duvall and Norberry back, but there was no life in their characters which was disappointing! Also, Kevin rapping - ewwww! He can't even rap - at least the guy who played him in the OG was actually talented. I will end on a positive note - for a musical this wasn't bad! I thought Regina's character had a phenomenal voice!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","kewlcow334-530-362355","27 January 2024","I am so glad this site allows for everyday people to review the movies, because there is NO WAY this movie is truly rated 6/10 with all of the negative real people reviews. This movie is a 2-3/10 at best! 1. I HATE musicals. I'm ready for the High School Musical/Glee/Pitch Perfect phase to get phased out! BUT, I can't fault this movie too much, because I was the one that made the mistake of not paying attention to the fact it was a musical (thanks to streaming with not a lot of exposure to commercials, lol) It was still a stupid presentation of this movie, though. 2. I give it 2 stars because some of the scenes were artful and well done. For example, the scene where Cady freaks out when Regina kisses Aaron. 3 The girl who played Karen... her part could have been left out in the same way this movie should not have been re-made. Amanda Seyfried nailed it, and this girl stared to hard, and I just wanted to punch her face. Even Cady was stupid, just not as obnoxiously off base as the girl that played Karen. Could be the directing, though. 4. Overall, this movie sucked. It was a huge disgrace to the original! They should have taken the story and evolved it, not copied it in campy stupid musical form! I 100% regret that I gave money to support this horrible film.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Socolorfull","15 January 2024","I will preface this by saying I have not seen the Broadway musical, but I have seen the original many times. I think the original is leaps and bounds better than this, but this was still a fun film and I recommend it for fans of Mean Girls or musicals.Renee Rapp as Regina George KILLED IT. She was by far the BEST part of this movie. While the Rachel McAdams Regina was a little nicer to your face and sinister behind your back, or delivered mean lines with a smile on her face, Renee Rapp's Regina was just plain mean and it worked. I'm kind of terrified of Renee's Regina. Really, the entire Plastic squad was well cast and had quite a few hilarious moments.Now, my girl Lindsay Lohan did Cady Heron way better than Angourie Rice did. I understand that Cady is supposed to be a vanilla, kind of forgettable kind of girl, but eventually she is supposed to be a plastic right?! Angourie's Cady is unforgettable. The charm and comedic timing that Lohan brought to the role was completely lost.The rest of the cast, including Janice and Damien, Tina Fey as the math teacher, and the cameos (I was so hoping for a Amy Poehler cameo but alas my wish did not come true) were a lot of fun.The music was good, and added some depth and extra info to classic scenes you'll remember from the original Mean Girls Movie.Overall, it was fun. I'd watch it again to watch Renee Rapp do her thing, but it won't be on repeat like the original Mean Girls is.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","hailey-45671","11 March 2024","As a millennial who was just out of high school when the original was released I find it HYSTERICALLY funny how many people are trashing this film bc it doesn't fit exactly what they wanted. How dare Auntie Tina evolve and speak to a younger audience than those of us pushing 40?! The whole moral of the story is learning how to divorce yourself from the cycle of trash talking other women and their choices to make yourself feel better. I ADORE this new version more than the original as a better message, more engaging, more interesting, and less littered with toxic stereotypes that are not genuinely funny. Auntie FIXED a lot of her biases and blind spots from two decades ago and a powerhouse young cast retold the retold story (this is based on a BOOK yall!) for their peers and younger siblings.The people that hated this are just incapable of joy, or spelling for many of these reviews, and it's truly a tragedy they got none of the lessons from the original work. Aunt Tina was wise to remove the sexist and race baiting fodder that these lost souls came looking for. I could not be more thrilled with not only the quality of this production but the sheer testament these bad reviews are making that no good lessons can stick from a work littered with attempts to appease bullies and imbeciles.The people who hated this and are so incredibly cruel about presenting their personal opinion forgetting all the real human beings involved in making this work are the exact people who need to watch this movie on repeat until they actually understand the message. That said, those of us pushing 40 and having fun with it are having a good time amongst ourselves and not a tear will be shed if yall show yourselves out.As we say in Texas, don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya lol Aunt Tina doesn't care, we don't care, the kids don't care, the only person made miserable is the miserable people who can't unclutch their ancient pearls long enough to have fun with something new.If you like catchy musicals and a spot on pacing between songs and dialogue and absolutely fabulous choreography, lighting and set, this movie is incredibly difficult not to love. Just leave your ""back in my day"" syndrome in the other room and remember how trashy the 90s and 2000s really were.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","TheZodiacDozenBooks","1 February 2024","Honestly, if I was writing this based on the first 30 minutes of the film, it probably would've landed at a 4/10 for me, but I found myself enjoying it more and more as it progressed. My wife and I went into it looking for a few hours' relaxation / a mindless popcorn movie, and that's what we got, so good job.At first, I sorely missed some of the original film's actors, but as I sat there I realized that nostalgia was a big part of that for me. Also, NOW I can say how much I love the original actresses who played Gretchen, Janice, etc... but that's because I've seen them in movies since/they've had 20 years to grow on me. All that to say, I think the new cast needs to be given a chance, and I expect to like this movie more as time goes on and I've seen them in other projects.I also think some characters were actually improved upon here. I liked both Damien and Karen better in this film, and Kevin G. Was right on par.I'm giving this movie a slightly weighted 7/10 to boost it's average, as I don't find the current 6.3 stars accurate. Giving this movie a 1/10 - or ANY movie that rating, tbh - is just being dramatic and dishonest, and is treating the film unfairly. Anyway, that's what I know.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","kaelyndavis","15 January 2024","So I haven't even watched this movie whatsoever but seeing the reviews and listening to the album track just has me so genuinely disappointed. I love Renee Rapp and from what I've heard in the soundtrack she did amazing because she has played Regina on Broadway.However the girl who played Cady should have been different. I get the girl who played Cady was trying to sing in an American accent but in that case it should have been an American actor. She had no emotion in her singing and it isn't as good as the original broadway production.Janis and Damien were played by decent actors and their songs weren't the worst but they should have given the girl who played Janis her song in the album and not just the movie. She was jipped. Along with the fact they took both Gretchen and Karen's part out of Meet the Plastics, at that point it's just World Burn Reprise before actual World Burn.I just believe I shouldn't waste my money on watching something I'm already let down by. Real theater people would know how poorly this movie was done without seeing it and just listening to the soundtrack. Renee is the only reason that movie had hope but the rest is completely awful. I just don't think there was any emotion in most of the songs except for the ones Renee was in.Stupid with Love has NO EMOTION it feels like she is being forced to sing it. It's awful. I had high hopes for this movie and I don't even want to see it now because of how butchered most of the songs are.","

I did not watch or read any spoilers beforehand in order to have a fresh mind going in. I did no realize it was a musical but I did not mind it. Just very tik tok based and towards the high school crowd. Tried too hard to be relevant to today's trends. It was very cringy. Thought about leaving half way through but I paid so I stayed, kinda hoping it would have a saving grace at some point. The jokes weren't all that funny to me.

Lindsey Lohan making a a cameo was pretty cool. The new Karen is hilarious, almost adds up to the original one. The new Gretchen sucks, just doesn't hit the same. Honestly the story is pretty much the same just modernized. You can tell that some of the original jokes where taken out because of the times and they had to be politically correct. But some of the best parts of the original was how out of pocket it was, the jokes were just so raunchy.","

Why couldn't they just produce a new movie that was an actual sequel. This is another mistake by hollywood producers that can't come up with unique ideas.

"Mean Girls (2024)","tobycross","22 February 2024","In the grand tradition of taking things that were perfectly fine to begin with and slapping on a musical number to see if it sticks, the cinematic world has been graced (or burdened, depending on your tolerance for high school drama set to song) with a musical reboot of 2004's ""Mean Girls."" Now, before you roll your eyes so hard they embark on an orbit of their own, let's dissect this glitterbomb of a film.First off, the color scheme. If Barbie ever decided to make a movie about high school hierarchy, this would be it. The palette is so bright and candy-colored, you'll be halfway through a bag of Skittles before the first chorus hits. But this isn't just any candy-coated spectacle; it's one with a soundtrack that slaps harder than Regina George on a carb-free day. The music in this reboot isn't just good; it's a character-driven symphony, each leitmotif weaving through the narrative like a well-placed burn in the Burn Book.Now, let's talk depth-or the notable lack thereof. Yes, the characters are as shallow as a kiddie pool in a drought, but they're drawn with such sharp, caricatured finesse, you can't help but be intrigued. They're the same Plastics we love to hate, but with enough of a twist to keep them from feeling like stale, reheated leftovers from the early 2000s.The cinematography deserves a shoutout. Transitioning from the wild plains of Kenya to the jungle of American high school corridors, the film employs some clever cuts and visual tricks that keep your eyes glued to the screen, wondering what they'll throw at you next. It's like being on a safari, if the animals were replaced with teenagers navigating the social pecking order.And the plot? It zips along with the speed of gossip through the lunchroom, engaging and entertaining without overstaying its welcome. This reboot brings a fresh twist to the tale, ensuring that even those familiar with the original will find something new to enjoy.In summary, the ""Mean Girls"" musical reboot is a high-energy, visually dazzling affair that proves even the most cynical among us can't resist the pull of well-crafted pop numbers and a dash of high school nostalgia. It's shallow, yes, but like the perfect Instagram filter, it knows its strengths and plays to them beautifully. So fetch your popcorn, leave your deep thoughts at the door, and prepare for a ride that's as entertaining as it is unabashedly flamboyant.","

The plot is nearly identical to the original but slightly updated to include a more diverse cast and actual queer representation. The music was decent but the pacing was a bit weird with a bunch of songs and then no songs and then more songs. I'm not going to be adding this album to my rotation. I thought the secondary characters really stood out, especially Janis, Damien, and Karen. I was really glad that Janis was explicitly queer instead of it just being a hurtful rumor and then her ending up in a heterosexual relationship. Cady was good but I didn't connect with her the same way I did with the original. Regina was a great singer but she wasn't mean enough. She was a jerk but I didn't feel like she was an awful person and want her to be torn down. Overall it was a pretty good movie and I might watch it again at some point.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","audreybeale","15 January 2024","The original Mean Girls came out just a little before my time - by the time I watched it, it had been so over-quoted that I couldn't enjoy the punchlines because I already knew them. The musical, however, I discovered during COVID and really enjoyed, so was excited to see this adaptation.Unfortunately, while I think there was a lot of potential and I loved every second Renee Rapp was on the screen, many sequences fell flat for me. It reminded me a lot of when Dear Evan Hansen came out in terms of weird editing choices for the music.Where the camera chose to focus during musical sequences were incredibly odd. Especially in the case of our main character, Cady, the music was extremely underwhelming and off-putting. Additionally, her songs all felt like they were meant to put the audience to sleep. 'Revenge Party's was the only song she was included in where I actually liked the editing choices. The 'fish eye lens' part seems very controversial but I thought it was a funny and different choice compared to her sitting alone in a CGI field singing in the beginning.For the song 'What is wrong with me?' that Gretchen sings, it came out of nowhere and felt very out of place. However, that didn't have to be the case! The writers could seriously take notes from Bollywood in terms of how to introduce a musical number in a song that is more heartfelt without weirding out the audience or putting them to sleep. Even the recent musical movie Wonka was able to pull off musical sequences in ways this movie falls flat.My favorite parts of the movie were anytime Janice, Damien, or Regina were present. They all stole the show in their own ways and deserve praise.Overall, this movie was not terrible! But it often took me out of the experience with it's odd choices to dull its musical edge. My hope is that future musicals come out, but that they learn from Mean Girls (2024) and Dear Evan Hansen.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","skirby-33125","12 January 2024","This version is friendly for 2024.Janis' identity is no longer the point of contention between she and Regina. Instead, she's open about her sexuality without it being the whole of her identity in the movie. Their disagreement stems from something petty and forgettable, which is the whole point, so I admire their willingness to alter that part of the story.Cady is not entirely convincing as a spy. There's no real reason why the plastics should believe she's part of their group, thus making the ""missions"" unsuccessful. She sways too much in the middle, not committing herself to either side of the line. Knowing how successful the initial portrayal of the film was, this was disappointing. The cunningness that Lohan's version demonstrated is what sold the movie.Still, the characters are fun and there were plenty of laughs throughout. The cast has chemistry, which is important.The movie appears to be shot through the lens of Janis and Dameon; it eliminates the monologuing we get from the original. Some of those moments were necessary for the plot. We get the same lesson from this version, but in a less-organic fashion.Overall, I would watch this film again, but the original film will likely always reign supreme.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","emmatiffaniegallagher","27 January 2024","There were a lot of parts in this movie that were to say the least...awkward. For example, the dancing in ""Apex Predator"" and quite a few of the jokes felt forced or just didn't land at all. There was an almost over use, of clips that were meant to look like TikTok or Instagram, it felt kind of out of place. Not to mention, the amount of brand placement was lowkey insane (specifically E.l.f.).However, and I don't know if this was intentional or not, that awkwardness, and brand placement, and over use of social media really does capture the life of what its like to be a real teenager. Because guess what these kind of cliques very rarely exist in high school and when they do it's very cliche and ridiculous for everyone involved.Similarly, one chief complaint I've seen is that the music doesn't sound the same in the movie and is less powerful than in the musical. While yes, it does sound different, its not less powerful its just a different kind of vibe. For example, with Revenge Party Cady's tone is more angry in the musical whereas in the movie her tone is more hurt. Also, show music and movie music are very different, so it makes sense that they would switch things up a little to make it come across on screen a little better.This movie had a lot of amazing things. The cast did very well and the casting department itself made really good choices (specifically with Jaqual Spivey as Damian, Auli'i Cravalho as Janis, and Bebe Woods as Gretchen). I loved a lot of the songs like World Burn, I See Stars, and I'd Rather Be Me.Also what movie with Renee Rapp wouldn't be good?!Overall, I think compared to the original movie and musical, Mean Girls (2024) seems lackluster. However, when looked at just by it's self its a decent watch that I would be excited to see again.","

The best by far in the movie is Rene rapp playing Regina George she is as good as broadway I loved her acting on the more negative side I wished the girl who played caddy could have been a stronger singer but she was still good after Rene rapp my favorite is the girl who play Karen she was perfect for the role I loved sexy it was so fun and honestly as good as broadway
All in all it was a awsome inbetween and something I would definitely watch again.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","sannebaartmans","21 January 2024","I went to see Mean Girls yesterday and to my surprise I thought it was a fun movie. I think the casting was done well. Reneé Rapp sang fantastic and you could hear that she did it professionally. For a feel good movie, I thought it was fine. Feel good films are no longer a genre and I would watch them anymore, but if anyone wants a feel good film of this time I would recommend this one. I do think the fist films are always the best. They did do a good remake for this time. I don't like that they put famous TikTok's in the film. That made the film look cheap. But I would give it a 6. Fun to watch but wouldn't watch it again. I am going to stick with the old one.","

We went to see it thinking it was just a regular comedy. Then they started singing and I thought oh damn, my husband doesn't love musicals and had I known it was a musical. I would've gone with somebody who loves them. The voices were good and I enjoyed it. He thought it was cute enough, but it just felt a little weird.What was pretty cool was e.l.f. Did a short film that was about 15 minutes called cosmetic criminal to open it. I would say we enjoyed it as much as the movie you can check it out on YouTube.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","joeyloweyscool09","18 February 2024","Would have given it a 9. But the musicals annoyed the living donkey out of me. If there were no musicals, the movie was very entertaining. I recommend, but get ready for some subpar musicals that have you wanting it to end fast. Acting was good and current. Funny enough. Not overly saturated. Great diversity cast, although I wish they could have used a brown latin character rather than a white one. I don't think the younger generation would enjoy this either as I saw my 14 year old brother in law want to shoot himself every time the musical parts started. Overall would still recommend. Great job, but I will take the original over this one.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","votypkaj","12 March 2024","I found the remake fun and entertaining. It stuck to the original plot pretty well but was a little ""clunky"" as another reviewer has said. The songs were new and the cast could sing.That brings me to my next point to counter those that did not like the fact that a musical was made out of the original movie. This remake was based off of the the actual broadway musical and it did do a good job of replicating the production. Those that took hits on Tina Fey and others involved with this movie are uninformed and shortsighted.Regardless, I recommend viewing at least once for the soundtrack. Some very catchy songs are in this movie.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","hbdgtsgpjc","14 January 2024","I usually don't write reviews about movies but I really feel like this move needs one. I watched the original mean girls, when I found out they were rebooting it, I was excited and went. Though, I was displeased first thing off the bat. The song in the beginning with Janis and Damian was unnecessary, and I know it's a musical, though not every waking second has to be a song. Also, the song when Cady was in Africa was unnecessary. We could've skipped right to her going to high school. Also, majority of my favorite scenes were alternated or cut out completely. For example, the rocking on a pole (?) scene. Why add acrobatics to the dance? Why not stick with the original timeline? I was confused on why they changed it, was it to be modern? Either way I didn't enjoy it. Or the world burn scene, I was most excited to see Regina throw all the burn book papers around the school and each student to pick up their own paper, but no! She just placed the book on the ground and left, VERY disappointed, one thing I actually wanted to see was Janis and Damian kiss at the end of the movie (it's a funny part for me) but it was just cut out completely. Though the singing was good. I liked the soundtrack.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","yasmin_saleh","28 January 2024","This film is a remake of the 2004 film ""Girls Club"" with Lindsay Lohan. For me, this film (Mean Girl) was like a test film because I had the feeling that they weren't interested in working with the actors and the dialogue, only in the camera work.My suggestion for improvement:1. Acting: Some actors were really great. I could see in their eyes that they really liked their roles. But other actors should continue to work on their skills. Do not give up2. Dialogue: What was the point of this film? Why did you keep changing the characteristics of the main character? Who was really the antagonist?3. Technique: Chapeau to the DOP. I think this film was just a test for the camera because there were a lot of ""one-cuts"". Especially in the music scenes.4. Film poster: Whoever designed the poster, I was very confused by it. I thought Regina was the main character because she was the tallest on the poster, but I was wrong: it was the little person on the left.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","sissyrock","17 January 2024","They tried to fit a movie and a Broadway musical into one movie, and it flopped really badly. They didn't include half of the Broadway songs which give a lot of the characters their actual personality, and without it the characters were lifeless. Gretchen and Karen are huge examples. Not including their part in Meet the Plastics is criminal, and Stop was such a good song left out that would have been comedy gold. I feel like the plastics should have a spotlight. At least Karen gets the song 'Sexy' but Gretchen is criminally underused and felt like an extra. They didn't include her obsessive nature and desperation, none of her song moments, and in the actual movie she is sidelined so hard. The actual song changes too were flat and boring. Were they even trying? It's such a let down. Felt rushed and autotuned with way too much product placement. Save yourself the trouble and see the Broadway version. You'll have way more fun. Listen to the crappy movie version of Revenge party and the good Broadway version side by side and You'll see the Broadway is better in every way. Don't waste your time, just watch the amazing original movie or the Broadway version and not this mixed bag of low effort, boring version.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","kelseyawilliamson-89422","19 January 2024","They tried to do a gen z reboot and a musical live action and it seems they only half tried on both. I LOVE the musical and Renee Rapp, and can't understand why they botched the songs so heavily. The melody changes don't work and parred down music just sounds so... boring. Regina, Janice and Karen are all pretty good in their roles but the lead as Cady just can't sing and wasn't meant for the role. It had some enjoyable moments but it's pretty forgettable overall and that's a shame. Not to mention the ""fire crotch"" joke possibly referencing Lindsay wasn't cute. Ultimately they did the musical and original movie a disservice.","

I love musical movies but only if its adds something to the movie. The singing: great, but the songs: horrible. It's been 2 hours, and not 1 song is stuck in my head. I can't even remember one song. Bad lyrics and bad timing.I didn't know much of the actors but they did a good job. Fun to see the connection between 2004 and 2024.But overall: I had a fun time. Great way to re-tell the story, with fun acting more diversity and a modern twist. But next time I'll watch the 2004 version. Damn I feel old.","

Tina Fey's comedy is usually quite funny; this was a mess.My question is: Why was this turned into a musical? It made the whole thing feel bubble-gummy and cheap. Even my teenage daughters remarked, ""This has got to be one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen."" If this was geared toward teenagers, both chose to get up and leave halfway through.Hopefully there are no more remake ideas of any of Tina Fey's classics. And especially making any of them musicals...","

"Mean Girls (2024)","pietschluke","14 January 2024","It's super refreshing to see mean girls back! A classic film loved by everyone all ages! This new updated revival of the classic film is fun. Yes it's fun, very colorful, inclusive, modern, etc etc. It was overall a solid film, DEFINITELY not flawless. For me sadly, the flaws outlawed it for me.The musical portion is interesting.. definitely not the worst. These actresses & actors have talent! Their singing is amazing. That's not the issue though.. the issue is how weird and out of place these musical numbers occur. For me the storyline felt messy when told through singing.. it leaves out very important themes in which are a necessary to make the storyline carry on. It felt forced. Wayyy too forced for me. It didn't feel naturalTo add, the characters are shallow and extremely hard to connect with, going further to even feel sympathy for them. What makes the classic a true classic is how charming and addictive Regina george is. Heck.. even all the characters, they are so addictive and charming. The new musical characters are one toned and rather boring. They don't even feel like a real friend group. It feels so unnatural. The classic mean girls had that bond and vibe where you could just tell it was them against north shore.The ending felt incomplete.. the storyline didn't feel wrapped up and just felt like it was missing that ""girlhood is in harmony and it's all sunshine and rainbows now"". Obviously Cady makes up with her friends but still, it just didn't feel right..Overall a nice film, I recommend it for everyone but just heads up, storyline is hard to connect with and follow along as every second a phone camera on screen is being popped up.","

They left out a lot of important pieces of the story so I do recommend watching the original movie before this remake. (this one) The songs were really catchy though so that's a bonus. They are all on my playlist right now. Renne Rapp caried the cast, she is an ICON and did an amazing job. She can definitely sing and really fits the role of Regina George. The other actors played their characters extremely well don't get me wrong here however Renne Rapp just stood out to me when watching the movie. Over all pretty good movie I do recommend however please do watch the original before.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","felizanaliah","10 March 2024","The new Mean Girls musical is an absolute delight, seamlessly integrating modern-day technology and slang to depict the high school world with authenticity. It's hilarious, capturing the essence of the original movie while injecting fresh humor and relevance. Contrary to some claims, the production avoids overuse of elf makeup plugins and delivers catchy, memorable songs that perfectly complement the storyline. The new Mean Girls musical flawlessly captures the essence of the beloved 2004 movie, portraying its iconic characters with depth and precision. From Regina George's sharp wit to Cady Heron's journey of self-discovery, each character is brought to life with authenticity. The storyline seamlessly flows with the energetic and vibrant vibe of the musical, maintaining the same charm and wit that made the original film a classic. With catchy songs, clever dialogue, and dazzling choreography, the Mean Girls musical is a delightful homage to its cinematic counterpart, sure to please fans both old and new. Overall, it's a must-see for fans of the original and newcomers alike, offering a refreshing take on a beloved classic.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","juliamcarp","19 February 2024","First, there wasn't much in the advertising to push the point that this is an adaptation of the Broadway musical. I knew because I watched interviews. Several in the theater could be heard asking what is going on? Cady's character is all over the place. There was no transition of her being plastic by the plastics. She is the same weird girl and over night is plastic after hanging out with them forever. There is a difference being smart and naive and just plain ignorant and not very bright. You have this girl that supposedly is a genius but she constantly goes through with the deer in headlights look. If you were looking at reliving Mean Girls, this wasn't it. Play the original and save yourself some heartache.","

No, but neither was the Broadway show. It was a great show but it didn't break any new ground. Neither does this movie but it's a fun watch.The only thing I will say is that it felt like all the belting was removed from the songs. I know some of these actors are capable of giving incredible vocal performances (Renee Rapp for starters) but none of the songs had that incredible long loud belts I am used to hearing from the Broadway soundtrack. Every song felt a bit flat but the cool visual effects and dance numbers made for a good show overall.This was not perfect but did not call for all the criticism, it was a great and fun watch. It is a ""chick flick"" after all...","

And I think my love of the original accounts for my fairly high score of this version. Just like wanting to be part of The Plastics' inner circle and their rules, I love the 'insider if you know you know' references. The Lindsey Logan cameo is brilliant and finding out what happens in Miss Norbury's love life...
I have not watched the stage production of this and I presume this film features the songs from it. I always say, I don't like musicals but then rate Hairspray, Moulin Rouge, and Grease 1 and 2 highly. At the start, I thought the medium of song was going to be quite tedious but, after that initial feeling, I actually enjoyed it.Don't go expecting something to equal or better the original but do go.","

I don't feel the musical numbers spoke to me in any way. The plot itself moved so fast (likely due to all the tunes). It felt like I was sitting in my middle school auditorium watching a play. I didn't feel soul or connection from or with any of the characters. I truly think the remake would have had a better shot if it hadn't been turned into a musical. I will say I was giddy about the appearance of Lindsay Lohan in the film, and I did laugh once or twice. The original outshines this version no doubt about it.",NA

I wish I had read the reviews before spending money at the theater. When the ads said it was an updated remake, I thought that meant in terms of racial equity (e.g. Damian and Karen not being white). I had no idea it was going to be a musical. I did not know about the Mean Girls musical or I would have figured it out. I felt the songs were insufferable. My favorite part of the whole movie was the Lindsay Lohan cameo at the Mathletes event. I was also disappointed that they kept the same stereotypical characters as matheletes. At least they didn't make 'the girl' on the opposing team ugly.",NA
"Mean Girls (2024)","joelhoworth","15 January 2024","So I get that the film is an adaptation of the Stage Show, which is in itself an adaptation of the original film. However, they kinda only half committed to the musical side which is a bit of a shame as I've heard some the absolutes belters were missed out. And I didn't really enjoy the songs they did use that much. The music fell a bit flat. Which does not bode well for a musical.That's not my problem with this film though, it's supposed to be set at high school, yet they used a cast of adults to play the kids. It was really weird, it took me completely out of it, watching a load of women pretend to be 16 year old girls. I'm sure the list of teen actors waiting for the opportunity to play roles like these is long and ever growing, and instead of giving it to some young, up and coming, age appropriate actor, they cast women in their mid 20's instead?! Weird.",NA
"Mean Girls (2024)","dsaycocie","2 March 2024","So I was excited to see the movie because I loved the original. The musical is really bright and colorful. The music was actually not bad except Gretchen's lil part. It was just cool to compare the 2. They do tweak some stuff to make it more modern I suppose. NOTHING can compare it to the original of course, but it was fun. There was a of couple of good laughs...Go in theater open to something new and then compare it to the original. I've watched it twice!P.s Avantika stole the show with her Halloween party video. She is just too cute!!BTW you can watch that video on YouTube 👆👆 I've been rewatching since...Also Lindsay Lohan makes an appearance.ALSO..the original Gretchen whiners stook out wayyyy more than the musical version. 👎👎",NA
