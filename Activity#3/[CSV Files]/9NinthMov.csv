"Divergent","claudio_carvalho","13 September 2014","In a post-apocalyptic dystopia, the world is destroyed and only Chicago has survived with a society divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). The teenager Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) belongs to the Abnegation that rules the society but she fells outcast and attracted by the Dauntless. When she is sixteen years old, she is submitted to an aptitude test to indicate in which faction she will stay for the rest of her life, but she learns that she has aptitude to be in the Abnegation, Erudite and Dauntless. Further, she learns that she is a Divergent that is destroyed by the government. On the next day, she chooses to join the Dauntless where she changes her name to Tris and is trained by Four (Theo James). They fall in love with each other and soon Tris discovers that the Erudite are planning to take over the power from the Abnegation and become the ruling faction. ""Divergent"" is an adventure movie with a dull and lame story based in a stupid and senseless concept of society. The dystopia does not make any sense and everything is idiotic in the story: the society, the plot, the romance, the way the Dauntless jump from the train, the conclusion. If there is a faction formed for the most intelligent people, it seems to be obvious that they should rule this chaotic society. Tris kills many soldiers but she leaves Jeanine alive in the end. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Divergente"" (""Divergent"")","

"Divergent","kevinmorice","11 April 2014","Much like similar teen girl action movie series this one kills itself early on by introducing so many holes that the house of cards that they then try to build has no foundation. Before the credits are even over the story makes less than no sense. Having destroyed civilisation in a world war (ok) Chicago survives. The survivors had enough materials to build a massive wall around the city, 300ft high, but can barely feed themselves. Now they have split into 5 factions (actually 6 because they throw a lot of people out and call them 'factionless') and this somehow magically creates peace. So none of that makes sense, and much like Hunger Games, having built a nonsensical premise we now follow a teenage girl as she turns into a super-soldier capable of jumping of buildings fighting off trained armies single-handed (using a cheap looking paint-ball gun). All the while with her buff and perfectly capable new boyfriend doing as little as possible to help her. Oh and I forgot a quick detour while we ride a pointless zip wire through some buildings for absolutely no reason than to try and spend some of the left over special effects budget.And occasionally Kate Winslet pops up, but is shot from funny angles all the time while they try to make her baby look less visible. Not that they need to as her bad blonde hair is distracting enough.All in a total waste of 2 hours. Just go and watch Twilight or Hunger Games for the same movie done slightly (but not a lot) better.","

"Divergent","3xHCCH","20 March 2014","Just finished reading the book ""Divergent"" before the movie opened today. It was a quick easy read. There was obvious inspiration from various other futuristic young adult books I have read, like ""The Giver"", ""Ender's Game"" and the ""Hunger Games"" books. Like the others, the treatment of the story was cold, But its descriptions of the initiation rites were very much more violent. The setting is the walled city of Chicago after a great war. Their society is divided into five distinct Factions based on personality traits: Dauntless (brave), Amity (friendly), Candor (honest), Erudite (intelligent) and Abnegation (selfless). At the age of 16, a child takes an examination to help him choose which one will be his faction for the rest of his life. He may follow the suggestion of the exam results, or he may decide on his own. Those who fail to be accepted into a faction becomes factionless, as they become hopelessly poor and destitute for life. Our heroine Beatrice Prior has been born to the Abnegation faction with their grey clothes and disdain for any form of vanity. However, her examination results are revealed to be inconclusive, so she has to make her own decision. Meanwhile, an uprising is brewing in Erudite against the government run by Abnegation. I had some problem with the book and the way they try to make the Factions distinct from each other, when it is easy to see that overlapping does happen. These traits simply cannot be mutually exclusive from each other. It is also disturbing the way the author describes the Dauntless. Does being brave mean jumping off running trains, having piercings and tattoos, beating each other up mercilessly, or even killing yourself? This may give immature readers the wrong ideas about courage. o - o - o -The film was a perfectly conceived interpretation of the book. In the first few scenes where they show the color-coded clothes distinguishing each faction was quite clear. How director Neil Burger showed us most of the memorable scenes in the book, like the choosing ceremony, the jumping on and off the trains, the fear landscapes of Tris and Four, and the invasion of Abnegation were all very well done.There were some parts which were reinterpreted in the film. Most did not really affect the story-telling, like changing how Tris meets her Mom during Visiting Day, or glossing over a particularly violent episode where Peter stabs a fellow initiate in the eye. There was one big change towards the end about how a climactic surprise rescue transpired. I thought the version in the book was so much more better set-up and executed than the less-dramatic altered version we saw on screen.As I suspected, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely not the small and mousy Tris we imagine while reading the book. However, I thought Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of Tris' character, how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior. For people who have not read the books, they will not be aware of any discrepancy at all. Theo James had very good romantic chemistry with Shailene, so his Four never really felt like a threat to Tris, unlike the initial parts in the book. The director gave James a lot of lingering close-ups for the benefit of the teenage fan girls. Ansel Elgort, who played Tommy Ross in ""Carrie"" recently, now plays Tris' brother Caleb. His Caleb is less dynamic than I imagined him in the book. Coincidentally, Elgort has an upcoming movie with Shailene Woodley later this year called ""The Fault in Our Stars"" where they play boyfriend-girlfriend.More up and coming actors play other more minor characters. Zoe Kravitz, who was in ""After Earth"" last year, is not exactly how I envisioned Tris' best friend, but she won me over as the film went along. Miles Teller, who was recently in ""That Awkward Moment"", plays bad boy Peter, whose role in the film is much diminished compared to the book. Jai Courtney, who played Bruce Willis' son in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" last year, brutally plays Tris' tormentor in the training camp. Among the senior stars, Ashley Judd makes a nice comeback of sorts playing Tris' mother, who had major secrets of her own. Maggie Q played Tris' examiner and tattoo artist Tori with the requisite compassion. Kate Winslet plays the cool and calculating Erudite uprising leader Jeanine with icy perfection.Overall, I thought this film was a practically perfect interpretation of a book that was less than perfect in itself. So, whatever things the film might show us which we might not like, like the slow pace of action progression, and the questionable motives of the characters, are actually because the book told it that way. Fans of the ""Divergent"" books will find this film version faithful. While it cannot compare to the high standard set by the Hunger Games film series in terms of cinematic quality and character casting, ""Divergent"" definitely has its own entertaining appeal going for it. 7/10.","

"Divergent","Bruce722","6 April 2014","When reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate to film. It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.","

"Divergent","TheAnimalMother","8 September 2014","I have to say that the producers would have to be stupid not to use Burger again as the director. He did such a great job with this one. I thought I was going to see a film that was mostly aimed at teens. However the story alone makes this far superior to most teen oriented films. In fact this didn't feel much like a teen film at all. The fantasy story is a great metaphor for our current society, it's simply a very relevant film. The directing here was spot on. The story as fun as it is, does have a few holes, sure, but they are easy to look over because they are such small holes. The film simply works as a commentary piece on political philosophy, and as an entertaining action film laced with some romantic tension. In my view this film was far, far superior to the very teen oriented and very one dimensional Hunger Games, and it's certainly more unique as well. Woodley is impressive here, clearly showing the ability to play a very layered and complex character.8/10","

"Divergent","Logan-22","24 March 2014","I read the trilogy (which was nothing special and kept getting more annoying each sequel), but at least the first book had some kind of * something * to it. The movie sucks. It is boring and there is very little action (and what little there was is over too fast and not very thrilling). The violence is sanitized with the only real blood being when Four nicks Tris's ear with a knife toss. The two most horrifying scenes in the book are not even included: the attempted rape of Tris by Peter's gang and the transfer girl who jumps from the train and misses the Dauntless rooftop to splat on the street below. Tris doesn't have a ""save the cat"" moment early on and provides no real reason to ever like her.The story takes too long to get going, then the training goes on forever, only to have the ending feel rushed. Not once did I feel anyone's life was in danger. Not once did I perceive any credible romantic chemistry between Tris and Four. Not once did I laugh, cry, or feel anything but bored. And it goes on for two and a half hours! Ugh. Sure, the production values are high, but who cares if I can't relate to any of the characters or the story? It's just a dumb waste of time. I didn't hate it (only because I scored a free ticket), but have no desire to watch the sequels.However, I'm glad Divergent made a bunch of money opening weekend to pave the way for other YA books to be adapted into films, but they need to do a better job. The reason all the recent YA adaptations tanked at the box office is because they sucked (Vampire Academy, Beautiful Creatures, City of Bones). The only decent one I can remember was Warm Bodies.","

"Divergent","tandrei2001","27 March 2014","I went to see this movie misled by the high rating on IMDb. Unfortunately it looks like Hollywood makes movies for people with short memory. I admit I haven't read the source book, but I guess I wouldn't, judging by what came out of it. I hereby venture myself in saying that the book is also a bad SciFi novel. It has way to obvious imports from well known themes that have been exploited to the brim by today (like the ""perfect"" society that sacrifices diversity for peace, the ""different"" guy that stands-up to the system, the genuine technology that controls individuals (poorly described, by the way), the fear confrontation ad the list could go on and on. It is not essentially bad to bring these themes in a movie, but I see nothing new, original here. So... if you have seen Equilibrum and the Hunger Games then you know it all. Movies today are just mobile phones... keep reproducing ""features"" from the competition, while it is supposed to be an art. Another thing can't stand in movies in general is the poor IT incursions. I am talking about the scene in which Jeanine is asked to turn off the ""control system"" which consists of a huge touch screen in which she just hits some ""cancel"" button. That was really pathetic... Anyone could have done that right? Another thing that I can't stand, is the cheap psychology things in these movies. They are all based on some sort of psychoanalysis which is long time deprecated in therapy. But it is somehow considered to be ""cool"" and ""trendy"" by producers to insert these kind of flavour into the movies to make it more profound. Or are they just as stupid and ignorants as the target viewers? Anyhow... to me, this is bad taste in art. If you want to really go for it, you must do way better that that and if you can't, then at least make it more interesting. It is also true that movies like ""Inception"" don't occur every month, but once they do... they set a trend and everybody will just take a byte of it. Don't get me wrong, it is a ""watchable"" movie, perhaps a little too long for its story, which, by the way, is very predictable and full of clichés. I read some users claiming it resembles ""The Hunger Games"" and so it is, especially with the modest ending that awkwardly announces a sequel. I could predict how the story developed and ended after the first 15 minutes and that's what makes this movie mediocre. Script is mediocre, but at least it does not abounds in stereotypes so it's bearable. What can be said about acting... there is no acting in this kind of movies, you only need to be young and good looking, be able to learn your part and you're done. It's not that the actors are bad, but the movie itself is not based on any acting mastery and just because of that, the girl gets a plus for making something out of it. I am curious if the ratings will stay as high as now in time.","

"Divergent","ironhorse_iv","11 September 2014","Divergent was indeed made to capitalize on the popularity of the Hunger Games book & film series by author Suzanne Collin. Some people might say, it's a total rip-off, but in my opinion, author Veronica Roth was influence by the books and inspiration to make her own. It's no differ, than Suzanne Collins taking elements from previous novels like George Orwell's 1984 and Koushun Takami's Battle Royale. For people to say, Divergent is a total rip-off of Hunger Games is an understatement. If anything, the movie is more influence by novel works like Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Dart, Orson Scott Card's Ender Games, and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Even the movie takes bit of its story from films like 2010's Inception by Christopher Nolan & Mark Water's 2004's Mean Girls. Other influences come from the Meyers-Briggs personality tests, Milgram experiment, and attitude toward divergent thinking (ATDT). This is a Psychology major fan film. With all this influences, Divergent create its own identify. The movie starts out in a futuristic dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). Members join a faction based on their preference but are initially given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Every year, 16-year-olds undergo a serum-based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit, but something went wrong, with Beatrice's test; as she shows that she has more than one personality trait, meaning that she's a Divergent. Since Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them, they're considered threats to the existing social order. The premise can be too far-fetched, improbable and illogical. You have to suspense your disbelief on this premise, as it's hard to believe that people can only have one personality trait. Since, it's a Sci-fiction film, anything is really possible. Personally, for a movie that supposedly has a lot of one-dimensional personality characters, these characters really do have a lot of divergent type traits. The pacing is a bit slow, as most of the time, the film focus on her time with the Dauntless. The training kinda did go a little too long. The plot could be a bit confusing, with all the tests, they go through and seeing how some test matter and some don't. The whole exposition somewhat got lost between the transfer from book to screen, as it wasn't that clear to the audience. Seeing how this film is the first one of the 3 books with the sequels Insurgent and Allegiant on their way. This movie will leave you with more questions, than answers, if you haven't read the books. Even if you readt the books, there are some minor different from the book to the film. The dream scenes were a bit longer in the book. Some characters such as Peter (Miles Teller)'s level of bullying is reduced to verbal comments as in the book, he's more engage in sexual abusing, and physical provoke her. Another big missing piece from the book is one of the character getting stabbed in the eye. Hopefully, they can fit that in, the next movies. Nothing too big was change in this film, so it's a fairly well adapted movie. The acting is pretty good for the most part. Shailene Woodley nearly quit acting in 2011, so it's good that she didn't, as she was great as the main lead. Theo James as her love-interest was pretty cool to have. The only problem is that Theo James acting really doesn't stand out. If anything, he kinda could be mistaken for James Franco. The supporting cast made out of Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoë Kravitz, Miles Teller, Tony Goldwyn, Maggie Q and Kate Winslet were all great in their own roles. The movie could need some more minority characters. I don't know if it's part of the story, with the white washing due to its being a post-apocalypse or Hollywood just being ethnic bias. After all, the United States seems to be home to large groups of immigrants of many races and ethnicities and they rarely depicted in films like this. Even Hunger Games had more ethnic characters than this. It really doesn't look like people from Chicago. I also would like not everybody looking like a model. It kinda hurts the realistic tone that the film is possible to represent. The movie was shot beautifully by director Nick Berger. The mirror scene alone had some really good symbolism. The music choice was pretty good. My favorite had to be Run Boy Run – Woodkid. I wouldn't say this movie is a chick flick or only for young adults as there is enough material for everybody to relate to. Overall: It's a surprisingly good YA sci-fi action drama thriller adaptation. I'll be looking forward to the sequels.","

"Divergent","Thanos_Alfie","8 February 2016","""Divergent"" is the first Sci-Fi movie of this trilogy and in this movie we watch a world that is divided into factions and each person has to be a part of one. Unfortunately Tris cannot be a part to any of these factions because she is a divergent. Divergents are considered as the most important and dangerous people and have to be eliminated but why?I liked this movie because it has a different kind of plot from other Sci-Fi movies and that's something that made this movie interesting at first. The direction which made by Neil Burger was very good with many good action scenes. Also the interpretation of Shailene Woodley who played as Tris was very good. An equally good interpretation made by Theo James who played as Four.Finally I have to admit that I did not expect much from ""Divergent"" but it was a very nice surprise. This movie made a very good start for this trilogy and I hope to continue like this and even better.","

"Divergent","jackmeat","21 August 2014","Settling in to this film, I expected to see Hunger Games again. Set in a near-future Chicago, what we see is another take on the dystopian society. The central plot here is that growing up in this walled in world, everyone must fit into one of five classes. But of course, the question here is what if you don't fit into the nicely packaged definition of a single class, then you must be Divergent, or in this movie, a danger to the perfect society. When our main character, Tris (played very well by Shailene Woodley)finds out she is Divergent she must hide this secret and discover the reasons why it is such a secret and why society fears Divergents. I'll leave all of that for you to watch unfold in the various physical and psychological training exercises that are portrayed on screen. In a nutshell, the world painted is similar to that of Equilibrium but with much less action. This is not a bad thing, since this allows the cinematographer to reveal a very wonderfully crafted view of this world. The pacing of this movie moves along nicely as we plod through Tris trying to fit in as a part of the Dauntless clan. Friendships are made, lost, and so on as expected. Even more so is the romantic involvement with the mysterious Four (or 4) played by Theo James (which I believe over acted his part entirely too much). So the mystery of why the government wants to kill all Divergents must be unraveled and this leads to the majority of the story. I was happy with just sitting back and enjoying the view during many of the scenes that were almost breathtaking. Not reading the book, I hope that the movie did well to portray the story but I also know it is a trilogy so they couldn't go from start to finish all at once. Stand alone I believe the movie was quite well made and under-appreciated, swept under the rug by the highly successful Hunger Games series. You will be hard pressed not to see the similarities between them. I am looking forward to seeing what else this world has in store for us and would recommend that moviegoers join me to find out. Will you see silly acted parts, and scenes that are just there to draw you in with nice landscapes and perfectly choreographed music, YES. But why would anyone complain about something like that? I know I wouldn't. Enjoy this film, you won't regret the time you spent on it.","

"Divergent","MovieSonic","29 July 2014","I'm glad I got around to watching this, I'm not sure who's writing the negative reviews or what they were expecting but I can honestly say that this is the best tween film I've seen in a long time.It IS a tween film, it's blatantly aimed at young girls and as a ""twenty-something"" youngish female, I'm not embarrassed to say that I really enjoyed this film. It's pure fantasy fodder of course but here's what I liked about it:the relationship between the two leads develops naturally i.e. they don't see each other and go 'you're my soulmate', in fact they don't really get on at first so this is believable and refreshingthe lead actress (Shailene Woodley) playing Tris is extremely natural and one of a very few actors I've ever seen who has convinced me that they are grieving (usually grief in films is just 'oh, they're dead, I'm so upset' ... swiftly moves on with their day..) - Actually both of the leads (Theo James as well) play their roles really wellI loved the point of view shots like when Tris looks at Four during the training and you see it from his perspective and then the camera cuts to his face to get his reaction to the look she gives him (there are other similar scenes) and it just adds to the effect of feeling like these are real people and I empathised with them more as a result Yeah the background story for the city is quite thin but who cares, stranger things have happened in the real world and what I like is that we're given a sense of 'this is what they've been told but is that what's really happened?'. I'm not sure if that's in the book or if the film makers wanted to add some realism for us grown-ups but when they question what's out there, I got the feeling this might be similar to The Island (2005) - that's not a spoiler it's just my opinion and probably totally off baseI have now watched this film about 4 or 5 times because I really liked so much of it: the fighting was believable for me because I think we've all gotten used to flashy choreography and sound effects but that's not what real fights look like or how they sound so for me, these fight scenes are really good. I liked the weapons because they kept it simple and for training, they're a good idea.Probably the thing I liked the most is the fact that ""it's not all about Tris"". I mean, it IS all about Tris but it's not 'totally in your face, the world revolves around Tris and no-one else matters' all about Tris... What I mean is that there are some ""films"" out there which spend their entire running time having the supporting actors running around warning the lead actress not to have sex with her boyfriend lest he destroy her vagina but in this film, the lead actress often shares centre stage with her new best friend, there are a lot of scenes where she is in the background looking out as opposed to a lot of shots of her standing alone / in the centre and we see her friend fighting too; the focus is just not 'always' on her. Having said that, I do think that there could have been even 'more' focus on the people around her. First of all, had we gotten to know her friends better, we might have empathised with them more (trying not to include spoilers!) and also, this will sound harsh but it needs saying, I'm sick of seeing 'ethnic' people in minor or reduced roles: what a waste of Mekhi Phifer! I wish that Zoë Kravitz had been given more to do, yes she had a decent amount of screen time but I would have liked to maybe see her 'fearscape' and... that's about it for ethnic characters I think... yep.I liked that Jai Courtney's character didn't go overboard as the villain but again, his character was a little one dimensional and I would have liked to have seen some more interaction and dialogue between him and Four just to flesh out their background story.Kate Winslet honestly did the best she could with her part and it's a massive credit to her that she managed to make me severely dislike her and believe that she was evil with just a few odd lines here and there. Her role is to literally just pop into the film every now and then to be a bit menacing and give off a female-Hitler vibe (bright blonde hair). But she pulls it off in my opinion. There's no point in elaborating on why someone is pure evil, we know this exists, it's happened in the real world and it's still happening so her role didn't distract from the believability of the story.Overall, I liked the subtlety of the story. There is no sex, no profanity, no overt 'I love yous' yet it didn't come across as 'after-school-specially' at all. Also, I never groaned out loud once or cringed or had to hide my face behind a pillow while someone professed their undying love for someone they just met a week ago. The dialogue was realistic with occasional over-rehearsed acting from some of the supporting cast but I really loved this film. Go into it knowing it's a tween film and that there won't be a lot of intelligent scientific explanations for things and you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.9/10","

"Divergent","shawneofthedead","19 March 2014","When beloved books make their way to the silver screen, the resulting movies are usually met with much frustration and rending of clothes from amongst the literary faithful. A character is changed beyond recognition; a crucial plot-point excised; an important theme lost in the murk and swell of a film. Oddly, Divergent isn't actually a bad adaptation. In fact, Neil Burger's film is as good a version of Veronica Roth's wildly patchy source novel as you're likely to get. Whether that makes for a good movie - especially for people who've never read the book - is another matter entirely.Divergent begins in a post-apocalyptic Chicago divided into five factions, each valuing one virtue - Dauntless (courage), Erudite (wisdom), Candour (honesty), Amity (kindness), and Abnegation (self-sacrifice) - above all others. It's an odd system, perhaps, but one that is apparently necessary to keep chaos at bay. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) has been raised in Abnegation but, try as she might, she cannot completely subsume her self or her desires. Indeed, the aptitude test that everyone must take at the age of sixteen suggests that Tris doesn't belong in just one category: she is Divergent, equally at home in three factions.Come the day of the Choosing Ceremony, she decides to forsake her family to become Dauntless: a decision that plunges her into a nightmare initiation process in which the weakest are summarily kicked out of the faction. As Tris navigates the politics and perils of her chosen world, trying all the while to hide the fact that she's Divergent, she encounters her fair share of allies - Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Will (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) and possibly her charmingly broody instructor Four (Theo James) - and enemies, including the brutal Eric (Jai Courtney) and vicious Peter (Miles Teller).Anyone unfamiliar with Roth's book might find themselves trying to puzzle through this seemingly shapeless mess of a plot. It ebbs and flows in odd directions, dancing around Tris' desire to be true to herself, before it gets a little lost in the dystopian clutches of Jeanine Matthews (a gleefully icy, evil Kate Winslet), an Erudite leader hellbent on bringing down the entire Abnegation faction. Along the way, Tris literally battles her fears under the influence of a simulation serum, toughens up physically, strikes up a sexy chemistry with Four and frets over her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort). Within the confines of this universe, it makes an odd kind of narrative sense, but the logic of it all never really bleeds through.Here's the thing, though: this strange, frequently illogical plotting is very much a defining characteristic of Roth's novel - and, in fact, becomes more of a problem as the trilogy progresses. (Anyone who's read Allegiant, the controversial final novel in the series, will know just how difficult it will be to adapt.) The emotional and logical flaws present in Divergent the film, then, are - for the most part - already inherent in the book. Why does Jeanine, supposedly one of the smartest people in the community, plot and plan the way she does? How does the entire society function in this utterly dysfunctional way? Technically, Burger can't really be faulted for failing to develop a coherence and logic that was never there in the first place.In fact, Burger actually substantially improves upon the novel in several ways - he keeps the film mostly free of Tris' inner voice, which becomes increasingly moony and silly as her crush on Four grows by the day. Burger plays up a zip-line sequence that highlights the joyful recklessness of the Dauntless, as Tris soars freely through the midnight air. He also handles the problem of Tris' fear landscape very well: instead of simply willing herself out of the influence of the serum (as the Divergent can do), she must figure out how to face each of her fears in a non-Divergent way. These scenes are shot with quick, simple visual flair, dispensing with some of the novel's trickier convolutions.Of course, Divergent isn't a perfect adaptation either. To Roth's credit, there are some truly dark, painful moments in the novel which transcend its loopy narrative. It's no surprise, and yet it's a little disappointing, that these bits simply vanish from the film, no doubt in the interests of securing a PG-13 rating. As a result, Peter is a far less repulsive antagonist than he is on paper. For instance, he doesn't brutally (and casually) maul a fellow initiate who's doing better than him in the rankings - an incident that's crucial in the development of his character in the subsequent novels.The young cast works hard and quite well together. Woodley makes for an intriguing screen presence, effectively playing both the steel and softness of Tris' choices. James, heretofore best known for dying in Lady Mary's bed in Downton Abbey, acquits himself reasonably well - he's not as leaden as some of the trailers have suggested, and he forges a believable chemistry with Woodley. Of the supporting players, Teller is the standout, so good in his easy malevolence that he actually makes the thought of Allegiant as a movie quite appealing.In the final analysis, Divergent is likely to divide audiences. Fans of Roth's books should be, on the whole, pleased. This is a frequently very good, intelligent adaptation of a rather problematic novel. Everyone else, however, might be less enamoured of the final product: a film that, just like the book on which it is based, boasts a compelling story and some great ideas, but is also messily executed, overly complicated and a tad nonsensical.","

"Divergent","moviexclusive","19 March 2014","Every studio hopes for a hit YA franchise, and in particular for Lionsgate-owned Summit Entertainment, the imperative is even stronger seeing as how they had unearthed that lucrative segment with the 'Twilight' series. And so 'Divergent' comes with high hopes that not only will it become hit YA property, it could potentially enjoy the same astronomical success as 'The Hunger Games', especially since both are of the sci-fi genre set in a post-apocalyptic world with fresh young faces.Adapted from Veronica Roth's book, it imagines a dystopia where society is organised into five distinct factions based on personality types, each understanding and playing its role in order to keep the peace. These are Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite, the names rather self-explanatory in describing what they represent. Youths are tested at the age of 16, given two likeliest factions from the results of a hallucinatory test, and then at a Choosing Day ceremony made to pick one of the two in which they choose to belong.As narrated by our lead character Beatrice Prior (The Descendants' Shailene Woodley), there are those fit into more than two categories which are labelled 'divergents' and cast out to live as homeless vagabonds on the pretense that they do not belong. Needless to say, Beatrice is a titular 'divergent', and warned by her testor (Maggie Q) that she must keep this information secret lest she be the subject of a witchhunt led by the leader of the snobbish Erudite faction Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet). So at her ceremony, unlike all the others, she exercises her free will to join the Dauntless, who train to be soldiers keeping the peace.Even with the task of laying franchise groundwork, it is both surprising and disappointing how much time the movie spends inside the subterranean Pit where Tris and the rest of her initiates train under the tough yet tender Instructor Four (Theo James) and the harsh and controlling leader Eric (Jai Courtney). From sparring to knife throwing to shooting, screen writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor spend about an hour laying out Tris' Dauntless boot-camp training and the dynamics between the trainees, in particular with two Candors - one a snide competitor played by Miles Teller and the other a loyal friend played by Zoe Kravitz.There is of course the budding romance between Tris and Instructor Four, the latter of which turns out to be a 'divergent' himself and who ends up teaching her how to overcome the final 'fear test' of her training. At no point however does director Neil Burger inject a sense of urgency into the proceedings, which unfold relatively unhurried and without consequence until the final half-hour. It is at best a drag, at worst a bore, and while parallels have been drawn between Tris' training and Katniss Everdeen's in 'The Hunger Games', you'll find the former here oddly devoid of danger or purpose.Only in the last segment is there some measure of thrill as a power struggle between the Erudites and the Abnegations build up into real conflict unfolding on the streets of an already war-ravaged Chicago. Burger assumes that his audience's patience will eventually pay off in a rushed final act that throws everything it can into the mix - including some heavy urban warfare, exposition, shifts in character - but it is a peculiar case of 'too much too late' that ends up making you frustrated more than anything else. There is little poignancy even with two key supporting characters meeting their demises within the short span of ten minutes, and that is also a result of the film's flawed construct, which diminishes the familial bonds illustrated in the novel between Tris and her parents (Tony Goldwyn and Ashley Judd) and twin brother (Ansel Elgort).With little chance to flex her acting muscles, Woodley is hardly any match for Jennifer Lawrence, and indeed doesn't quite grasp her character well enough to put forth a consistent and compelling portrait of Beatrice. At least she does share some screen chemistry with Underworld: Awakening's Theo James, the bond that builds slowly between them rather winning to say the least. Other thespians like Winslet and Judd give solid supporting turns, though they are yet again hemmed in by a ham-fisted script that hews too closely to the book's straightforward prose.On his part, Burger tries his best to build a convincing vision of a futuristic Chicago, but fails to convey the extent of a hyper- militarized and technologically advanced society on the verge of factional conflict. The postwar cityscape hardly leaves much of an impression, though the drug-induced mind trips that Beatrice takes boasts some degree of visual ingenuity that recalls Burger's far superior work in 'The Illusionist' and 'Limitless'. Worthy of special mention though is the score by Junkie XL (with Hans Zimmer listed as executive music producer), which hits the right notes more than you would expect in certain scenes.Still, it's hard to imagine 'Divergent' being the kickstarter the way the first 'Hunger Games' movie was; though both share similar narrative blueprints, this adaptation feels inert where the latter is lively, failing to engage its audience with its female teenage protagonist's rite of passage. Unless you're a fan of the books, you'll probably be lukewarm about the next instalment 'Insurgent' whose production is already underway; indeed, true to its title, there is something off about 'Divergent' that never quite reconciles even till the end of the movie.","

"Divergent","davispittman","21 April 2016","Divergent is an entertaining movie to sit and enjoy, that's for damn sure, it was actually better than what my expectations preceded. Shailene Woodley shines in her staring role as Beatrice, and Theo James is so perfect for his co staring role as Four. My absolute favorite actor here though is hands down Kate Winslet, she is so focused, determined, and unapologetically devoted to her maniacal plot, and it's obvious that she gave it her all the entire way through. The costume design is wonderfully constructed, especially for the Elite characters like Winslet. And the set direction is awesome to look at, very well put together. The action sequences are pretty standard PG-13 action movie material, not meaning that in a bad way, just saying you know what you're getting when it comes to that specific issue. The plot is very intriguing and it will for sure keep you interested and wanting more. Ashley Judd is great to see on screen here as well, a very noble addition to the well rounded cast, she is caring, adventurous and warm hearted in her motherly role to Beatrice. I really loved the dialogue back and forth between the characters too, very intelligent and witty. I cannot wait to sit and watch Insurgent, and then Allegiant, crossing my fingers in hopes they will prove themselves worthy, like this first installment did. An 8/10 for Divergent!","

"Divergent","trans_mauro","22 July 2014","...made into a pretty stupid film!Where authors(sic) get these unbelievably lame ideas? A world divided into 5 factions? This is ridiculous. This is another politically correct tripe. The plot is based on countless Hollywoodian stereotypes. Actors all look like they came out of catwalk fashion show. They have as much substance and personality as bobble head dolls. The film is tedious, move at a snail's pace and do not even fall into the category ""so bad it is good""It is embarrassing to know that there are those who classify this sophomoric attempt at literature as a dystopian science fiction novel.Pure waste of time, money.","

"Divergent","Tweekums","10 July 2019","This, the first film of three, is set in a world one hundred years after a cataclysmic war. Chicago is effectively a city state and as far as anybody knows there is no civilisation beyond the city. Society is divided into five factions to which people join based on their character type. These are Abnegation, the selfless who are also the governors; Amity, the kind who farm; Erudite, the intelligent; Dauntless, the brave who form the police/army; and Candor, the honest who serve justice. At sixteen people are tested to see which faction best suits them before making the choice as to which they join. Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior, the daughter of Abnegation parents, is one such youngster but her tests are inconclusive... she is 'Divergent'; one with strengths in multiple areas. She is cautioned that she must hide this as Divergents are considered dangerous. The next day she joins Dauntless and begins her training; if she does badly she risks failure and being declared factionless but if she does too well she could be identified as Divergent and killed... if that weren't enough she learns that the leadership of Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation.From the moment the world is described it is clear that the viewer will need to be able to suspend their disbelief... the idea that almost everybody will fit into one of the five described factions and Divergents will be rare seems unlikely. However if you can accept that the film is rather fun. The story may not provide many surprises but there are plenty of exciting moments as Tris and her fellow Dauntless recruits undergo initiations and training. There is also frequently a sense of real danger. Tris; as played by Shailene Woodley, who impressed in the role, is a fine protagonist and other key characters are solid too. The film has high production values with a realistic look and impressive effects. Some have compared this to films like 'The Hunger Games' but while there are some similarities I didn't really think about them at the time. Overall I thought this was as solid addition to the young adult dystopia genre... you certainly don't have to be a teenage girl to enjoy it. I'll certainly be watching the other films in the series.","

"Divergent","aker995","7 April 2014","As I said, the movie was extremely predictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did and I honestly felt like I was watching it for the 3rd time! There were no twists, no suspense, no surprises. I could not believe that there would be so many clichés and unrealistic scenes. Instead of an ""action/adventure film"" I saw a boring love story. I can't imagine how unbearable it must have been for those who read the book..*SPOILER* The following scenes are examples of why the plot was so obvious and boring: We knew that Tris would not go into the same faction as her family, we knew which one she'd choose, we knew that she'd fall in love with Four, we knew that she wouldn't get kicked out of training, we knew that Four would find out that she was a Divergent but wouldn't tell anybody etc... Moreover, the scene where Tris and Four fight is so unrealistic and again, the fact that he started fighting on her side was way too PREDICTABLE. *END OF SPOILER*To me, Divergent looked like a bad version of the Hunger Games and I am really surprised that so many people liked it. Unless you are a teenage girl who finds Theo James hot and unless you have never read any books or watched any other movies in your life, I see no reason why you would want to waste 2 and a half hours of your life watching Divergent.","

The whole faction idea is really interesting to see. The journey Tris goes through feels natural and not forced. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are equally great as Tris and Four. I thought Zoe Kravitz did a fantastic job as well. The romance is one of the best I have seen in teen movies. The action is suspenseful as the movie goes on you end up wanting more.
This movie ages well and never feels bland.","

"Divergent","fast-giga","23 July 2014","Of course this movie is made for a very young female audience so I have problems to identify myself with the targeted audience. The good point about the movie is, that the heroine is not complelty depending on her male counterpart, so its none of the ""girls-are-mentaly-and-physically-too-weak-to-exist-without-man"" movies, but thats about it. If you want to watch something about strong female characters try the legend of Korra. The rest of this movie is terrible, especially the huge amount of brain bleeding inducing logic errors.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!! For Soldiers knife throwing, jumping from trains and excessive hand-to-hand combat are the most important skills. As well as being complelty fearless...people throw knifes at you and you aren't allowed to be afraid? Yes, thats the stuff marines are made of. Being a soldier has nothing to do with endurence, guns, tactics and unimportant stuff like that real life soldiers train.Being ""divergent"" not fitting into a faction is something rare...at least thats what the characters say...funny how the rarest thing turns out to be a majority.The training officer sits at the same table as the rookies, but the rookies aren't allowed to talk to him? Yeah, makes sense.A rookies says something stupid to a teacher...and they put in into the world wide newspaper...yeah, nothing else interesting happening.Oh, I nearly forgot, the actual most important thing for a solider is house climbing. Know a soldier who hasn't climbed the empire state building? He's a noob.These are just some of the terrible brain bleeding inducing logic errors in this movie. If you are a 8 year old girl you might be able to accept them, but for everybody else this movie isn't watchable.","

"Divergent","september_90","29 October 2014","My review is not based on reading the book but solely on the movie alone. I found the movie very similar to The Hunger Games in the sense that it divides people into groups and focuses on the teenagers. But this movie was 100x better! It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. This movie is inspiring and motivational. It is the type of movie that shows that accepting people for the flaws and their strengths is important and that everyone is different in their own way and that it's okay to be who you are. I think more kids need to see these types of movies and I would recommend it to anyone. P.S. Do not watch this movie before or after The Fault In Our Stars cause it may make things a bit weird haha.","

"Divergent","goods116","24 March 2014","For some reason the rating is 7.7 with 1000s of data points, but the written reviews trash the movie -- ignore them, the numerical score is accurate. I read the books and saw the movie and thought both were very good -- not incredible, but good, deserving of 8 out of 10. One the key complaints is the same one you always hear when a movie is adapted to a book: how could they have not included scene/event/character x,y or z from the book? So and so does this in the book, but in the movie they do y. And so on. Give me a break. Does this really need to be repeated? You can't really convert a book perfectly into a 2 hour movie. You just can't. Characters get cut, shortcuts are made to the plot. Live with it or don't see the movie. Getting to the movie itself now. Yes, there are flaws and some logical missteps. But overall, the world that is created is visually appealing and interesting, the character (especially Woodley) do a good job, and the last portion, while a bit rushed perhaps, is engaging. I would say that the source material itself is not 10 out of 10 material, and the movie conforms to my rating -- very good, but not a 9 or a 10. If you can get over the book/movie thing, you will enjoy this movie.","

"Divergent","david-selin","16 April 2014","Four is the name of an important character in the movie. Apparently, it stands for poor writing, poor directing, poor casting, and poor acting.Let's start with the poor writing. Obviously this movie would be more enjoyable if one had read the book. Well, I hadn't, and therefore I was confused because the back-up story was non-existent. The movie takes place in an dystopian society. However, nobody tells what really happened to the world. Without adding any spoilers, it is hard to specify why the quality of the writing is constantly so poor, but let's just say that the story is so full of holes it looks like an emmental cheese. Poor directing. Good directing could have compensated for the ludicrous writing, but in Divergent they seem to form an unholy alliance. The scenes lack credibility - especially the action ones. Because of this, Divergent is a movie for the children at best. There are three characters that look somewhat the same. It took constant effort to keep on track on who is who. The absurd changing of the scenes didn't help. However, the biggest mistake of the casting crew was hiring Shailene Woodley. Sure, it is cool to see a relatively new face in a big budget movie, but there is a reason why it is so rare - they cannot act. The previous statement takes me to the final part, which rendered this movie close to unwatchable. The actors consist of young and inexperienced actors mostly. Because of the cheesy writing and directing, their acting seems even more horrible than it already is. Again, without including any spoilers, I won't go any deeper, but just watch the so-called ""chemistry"" between Tris and Four... Makes you feel awkward, huh?Finally, I want to clarify that I usually like dystopian films. In this case, I was expecting a rating of 7 or 8, so I'm still quite shocked because the movie fell below my expectations so badly. It just makes me so disappointed that this kind of budget goes to absolute waste because of these flaws I mentioned above. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are a big fan of the books!","

"Divergent","YJLcool","23 March 2014","After the tremendous success of Twilight, Harry Potter and Hunger Games series, Hollywood film studios have made several attempts to repeat the success. But, many have failed to capture the hearts of fans and general audience alike. Now, here comes another young adult sci-fi action drama thriller series...The Divergent Trilogy. Will it succeed and remembered as one of the good young adult series? Time will tell.Adapted from Veronica Roth's first book, it is a story about the conflict between individuality and social conformity...the dilemma of being different, not fitting in with the society and the fears that comes with it. It raises the question on why people in general, submit to social conformity (obedience and unwillingness to change), without any resistance. Is it really deeply rooted in our genes? Why individualists are mostly frown upon by society and feared by the authorities?The film offers an interesting world with strong characters, an engaging plot enough to captivate the audience for its long running time (140 minutes). In a post-apocalyptic Chicago, the people are divided into a five-faction social system, enforced by the authorities to maintain peace and order after an unspecified catastrophic war, based on their primary distinct personalities: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (kindness), Candor (honesty), Erudite (intelligence) and Dauntless (courage). The film starts out with the lead female character questions her place in society, but later on, she starts to question the fundamentals of the society itself.Much of the film's running time is dedicated to develop the characters enough for the audience to know them, by showing what they're going through and what they've become by the end of the film. The lead actors, Theo James and Shailene Woodley, delivered a solid performance in their respective roles and have a convincing on-screen chemistry between them. Kate Winslet, despite her short screen time (only about 20 minutes), manage to solidify her presence throughout the film, hinting that we'll be seeing her more in the next two films. Moreover, the ideas and concepts behind the psychology aptitude tests to determine which faction the characters belong or join are commendable as well, as they show the inner fears of the characters and why they possess the personalities mentioned in the film.However, some parts of the film feels rushed, especially the third art of the film, due to its heavy world-building, plot and character development in the first and second act. The fans of the books might complain about the missing parts, but from a person who haven't read the books (me), it seems fine and acceptable to me. I believe the film gets the essence of its source material right, despite the complex nature of its source material.Regardless of what the critics or fans said, the worlds and characters of Divergent and the Hunger Games are very different. Each stands on its own and shouldn't be compared with one another. The film has a good start. By the end of the film, I'm interested to see how things will be unfolded in the next sequel, Insurgent, which is releasing next year and how the story concludes in Allegiant, which will be released a year after Insurgent.Rating: 8/10 ""Individualism promotes personal freedom and achievement. Individualist culture awards social status to personal accomplishments such as important discoveries, innovations or great artistic achievements. Unfortunately, this threatens to those in power, the survival of a population of conformists that specifically adhere to well-defined rules and principles. So, the ones who are capable of thinking differently than others are usually rejected or deemed as outcasts in society. This creates a constant, endless struggle between individuality and conformity throughout the history of mankind.""","

"Divergent","HaveWisdomWillTravel","22 March 2014","I won't compare Shailene with JLaw, who I like. Basically, Shailene has presence, her acting authentic, she delivers what this role called for, and that's that. I want to address the audience's favorable response versus the ridiculous professional critic scoring.Of course the film is not perfect, in a way Gravity or Hunger Games are not perfect. But why should it be? Of course it has flaws, like, the typology of the factions - where is the Artist/Creatives? Without imaginative power we will all die of boredom or fascism. Also, Intellectuals/Scientists and Straight-talking Factual sort tend to flock together, too similar to be separate factions. The parent characters under-used, the girl feels a little over-coddled...etc.Still, no big narrative crimes, nothing deserving a hysterical fail rating. Those who never read the book, who have enough open-mindedness, with hope only to be engaged and entertained, will likely enjoy the ride. The premise was interesting enough, the direction and styling effective, the movie's story world construction well-executed, the story-telling and pacing engaging, the acting performance by the two leads and Winslet and Maggie Q well-balanced, believable and non-jarring, the resolution was convincing enough... So what's up with the 40%/ 4 stars hysteria among the pro critics? I have my theories...In general movies get anywhere between 1:1, 1:2, or 2:1 audience love it VS critic love it ratio. This one got 2:1. Which means, the film not only hit the right note with a progressive crowd, it also diverged greatly from an unspoken dogma. 40% pro critic here and elsewhere, wow, obviously Divergent hit a sensitive nerve with the film industry's Erudite equivalent. It seems, Divergent the movie is itself a divergent in its own context, a potentially uncontrollable menace to a rigid, retentive, non-divergent, evidently HOMOGENEOUS English language film critic culture...But in this case, I'd go by the Audience's score. For starters, a 1000000X larger sampling size is always more objective than a few hundred homogeneous Erudites. My rule is, movies with 1:1 audience:critic ratio, the rating is most objective. 1:2, the truth is somewhere in between. But if it's 2:1, the critics are upset about some game-changing ""threats"", and the truth leans strongly toward the audience. Works for me anyway... I call this the AUCRIT Ratio. Feel free to test it yourself. Onto Divergent...I've never read the book. I do keep my expectations on neutral when watching a mainstream big-concept film - especially yet another adapted post-apocalyptic science fiction targeting young adults.Those who expect futuristic science fictions to have primarily male leading characters esp in power positions, invincible biological strength, brute force solution, outcomes determined by technology especially Very Cool Weapons, non-stop magical actions, hot sexy androids and fetish costumes will be disappointed. Those who *demand* award-winning plot and ""logical"" science in futuristic fiction movies are just being hysterical, for they tend not to notice the fantastical magic, bad physics and overkill tech in their ""serious classic"" science fictions - from star trek, star wars, 2010, batman to iron man are equally full of gaping logical holes, mostly with no award-winning plot-craft.Truth is, ""hard"" science is evolving constantly, and science fiction flicks are not made to be 100% accurate or to win awards (if so Blade Runner still wins today), but to explore possibilities in highly-compressed scenarios, to inspire, to enlighten, and foremost, to entertain.In today's myopic, easily self-satisfied world which classifies and judges people by preconceived notions about ethnicity, gender, profession, appearance, merits, we are constantly divided by rigid specialization, subjective education qualification rules, redundant scientific dogmas, simplistic morality yardsticks, always under pressure to choose factions: With-Us-Or-Them, for or anti welfare/ abortion, JLaw-vs-Hathaway, Pepsi or Coke, the in-betweens be damned.Identity by Tribe (and inevitably the side-effect of xenophobia and authoritarianism) is a timely topic, how The Power That Be and their obedient citizenry react to the exceptional, multi-talented, multifaceted generalists who dare to defy categorization.And this is no Twilight. More Hunger Games meet Enders Game. Definitely gender-neutral in appeal, at least among under 30's. Not everything with strong female lead written by female authors equates Hunger Games or Twilight or Harry Porter. Some ancient mindsets need to get used to the brave new world with the other half of the human population, women, being visible half of the time.The lead actors also defy categorization in their own way. Here's yet another hot young male lead who has brain and brawn and talent and emotional depth all rolled into one person...yet another intelligent and talented and cute young female lead who doesn't over-groom herself nor perpetually pout nor seem like she's out to please everyone or martyr herself. Does the world need more unaffected chicks and unassuming hunks? Of course, there's never enough of those on screen.Divergent may not be The Matrix or Inception grade, but why should it be. I was definitely engaged and entertained. Good enough for me.","

"Divergent","Phillip_Tomasso","22 March 2014","I suppose this will be as much a book review as it is a movie review. I went with a group of friends and saw Divergent yesterday morning. The Pg-13 film was 139 minutes long. I will start my review by saying it was over in the blink of an eye and left me wanting so much more.Prior to the release, critics blasted the film. It received an average 3.5 out of a possible 10 Stars on I.M.D.B. This made me apprehensive. Critics also kept comparing Veronica Roth and her novels to Suzanne Collins and The Hunger Games. Scathing reviews said that Divergent was nowhere near as equally riveting as The Hunger Games. The stories are nothing alike. The only similarities I saw come from a strong female teen lead character. Is Katniss anything like Beatrice (Tris)? I suppose, but she is also completely different; motivated by a unique set of circumstances. No. I change my mind. Other than both being female, and teens, and the main characters of their own trilogies -- there are no other similarities. (Do not get me wrong. I enjoyed The Hunger Game books, and so far, the movies. I am just missing the point as to why the two sets of books/movies are being compared. There isn't one. And they shouldn't be).Personally, if you have not read the book Divergent and see the movie, I suspect the movie will be complicated. Not un-followable, just complicated. The plot is not simplistic despite being geared toward teens. I do know several people who have since seen the movie without having read the book and enjoyed the film just the same. Anyway . . .Set in a futuristic Chicago, a community is enclosed behind an electrified fence. The community is split into 5 Factions to keep things running smoothly. The intelligent faction is known as the Erudite; the honest, Candor. The peaceful people are known as Amity, and the brave, Dauntless. The selfless faction, the one Beatrice belongs to, is Abnegation. One is born and raised in the faction of their parents. On your sixteenth birthday, teens undergo a test to see which faction they actual belong in. Regardless, a person can pick to be in any of the other four factions, or stay in the faction they were raised in. When a teen chooses to leave the faction they were raised in, it is upsetting. They must say goodbye to their family. There is a good chance they will never see them again. And if you fail in your knew chosen faction, you can not return home. You become what is actually the 6th faction. The Factionless -- those who don't belong to any faction, and live like the homeless, scavenging for food, and clothing, and shelter. . .Beatrice's test results are inconclusive. They do not point to any one faction. Instead, they point to them all. She is what the government calls, Divergent. This is dangerous. Divergent do not think like anyone else, and therefore are a threat. Forced to keep the test results a secret, Beatrice must pick where she feels she best belongs.Abnegation has always been in charge of the local government because they are selfless and can therefore be trusted with politics. Beatrice discovers a plot by the Amity to overthrow the Abnegation. Chemical injections given to Dauntless will leave their minds susceptible to suggestion, making them dangerous and unstoppable --since the Dauntless train to be warriors, the police of the nation, the protectors of all.The movie is constantly compelling. The time flies. Beatrice (Tris) is played by Shailene Woodley. Never heard of her before. She nailed the role of Tris. (She reminded me of a young Tatum O'Neal. The way she talked. Something about her eyes, too. (The Fault in Our Stars will be released later this year, starring Woodley, as well). With forthcoming releases of Insurgent and Allegiant, she will surely be a star to watch.Theo James portrays Four. He also someone I have never heard of prior. At first, he was not what I pictured when reading the novel. Seemed a little too old. However, as the movie progressed, I think I saw what casting directors picked up on during auditions. He was Four. No way around it.While directed by Neil Burger, written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor, Roth did not give up her creative input. She also helped write, and co-produce the film. Good for her. Although some story elements from the novel are missing, overall the movie stayed mostly true and on point. Compelling and action-packed, great acting, and some intense scenes (yeah, I jumped once or twice), I found Divergent so entertaining. I cannot wait for the next in this bound to be popular trilogy.

What's more, the movie is not just about bleak dystopian locations and the direct bearing they have on the daily lives of their characters, but it also shrewdly manages to raise some highly pertinent questions about our own existence and what sort of world we could be leaving for the coming generations. The most uplifting fact about ""Divergent"" is that it pulls off this unexpected act through astute direction and some incredibly nuanced performances we usually don't associate with summer blockbusters.While, Kate Winslet is an old warhorse and has played practically every type of role with grace and confidence, Shailene Woodley is a revelation, and proves yet again why her name is being taken in the same breath these days with Jennifer Lawrence as one of Hollywood's brightest, upcoming female talents. She captures the desperation, confusion, grit, determination, vulnerability, and tenacity of her character with the kind of self-assured conviction and realism you'd associate with seasoned performers. Kate Winslet as usual just shows up and reminds us of her immense abilities in every frame she's in, playing the villain with menace and an uncompromising faith in her misguided beliefs. Ashley Judd lend great support in the few scenes she's in. Sadly, the rest of the cast offers nothing worth penning down.Now we all are well aware that this film is based on the first of a series of best selling fiction novels by author Veronica Roth, but as alluded to earlier, it's an aberration that the core elements of a good novel are retained while making it viable for a cinematic audience within cinematic time-constraints. For this reason alone, due credit must be bestowed upon screen-writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor for brilliantly adapting a recently loved novel, fresh in readers' memory, and transforming into a crisp screenplay that the Director and producers could work with. But, a screenplay - adapted or original - no matter how good, needs proper guidance, and this is provided with assured measure through the watchful eyes of Director, Neil Burger (known for accomplished efforts such as ""The Illusionist"" (2006), ""The Lucky Ones"" (2008), and ""Limitless"" (2011)). Alwin H. Küchler's cinematography could have been engaging and Richard Francis-Bruce and Nancy Richardson's editing could have been crisper, but thankfully they do not steer too far away from the plot.""Divergent"" not only gives us a fantastically entertaining blockbuster to thrill and chill us for w hours plus, it also offers up a thought- provoking sci-fi tale, which begs us to reflect on some startling points it raises even while we're being enthralled by the proceeding on-screen - something of an oddity in modern cinema. Along with being faithful to Roth's book, it also builds a strong cinematic universe apt for the screen and successfully manages to engage both sections of viewers - those who've enjoyed Roth's novel and even those who have no prior knowledge of the happenings of her dystopian fiction series. ""Divergent"" is basically a must-see for all who enjoy a thoroughly gripping, judicious sci-fi tale.","

"Divergent","ecatalan98","2 November 2014","I'm amazed to read most reviews here. It seems to me that most IMDb readers/users think of themselves as ""film noir"" critics, or maybe the second coming of Roger Ebert. When I watch a movie, I like being entertained. Sure, the story must be good but not necessarily plausible. If that was the case, movies like STAR WARS or even TITANIC would've been colossal failures. DIVERGENT was such a movie: entertaining, teen-oriented, post- apocalyptic fun. In the not so distant future we find out that there was a terrible war. Little is said who started it or what provoked such devastating war. What it is clear is that mankind survived and made strict rules for its new society in order to ensure the peace. This new society has been classified into different personality categories, or factions: abnegation, candor, dauntless, Amity and Erudite. Each strata of this new society complements the other factions so to keep a harmonious balance. The members of this society reach a certain age (18, I guess), they go through a series of tests that will define their definite personality, regardless if they come from a different faction. This new society's motto is ""faction before blood"", so one has to be more loyal to his or her faction than to their families. Those who do not fit in any faction are called (most obviously) faction less, but they do not pose a threat to society, simply an uncomfortable burden (they are the homeless, the tramps, the scum). As the movie moves along we find out that there is another profile of people who also don't fit in, but pose a supposedly ""serious threat"" to society. These are called ""divergent"" and are to be terminated as soon as they are spotted. Divergents possess qualities of all factions, they are like a ""greatest hits"" of factions.As you might guess, the movie revolves around a girl named Beatrice ""Tris"" and her finding that she is a ""divergent"" and how she must survive in a society that has no room for her kind.Shades of THE HUNGER GAMES are evident all over the place. THE MATRIX too, even FLASH GORDON (1980), but all done in very good taste. I found myself enjoying DIVERGENT significantly more than THE HUNGER GAMES (at least the 1st installment), which I'd like to remind all IMDb critics is a ""light version"" of BATTLE ROYALE. We get to see Kate Winslet (TITANIC) as the baddie. It was never clear to me if she was the President or what, but she seems to be in charge of this new society. Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn are in there too and that's about it as far as ""names"" in this picture. All other actors are basically teens or twenty somethings, so yes, there's a strong effort from the filmmakers to attract a young audience (like THE HUNGER GAMES). Anybody who's worked for a big, multi-national corporation will quickly see the similarities between the dystopian society portrayed in this movie and the company they might work for. Companies ALWAYS want to label their employees, as if we could only be ONE type of personality, so I found this intriguing. I supposed most ""Roger Eberts"" in IMDb barely perceived this. Was it a predictable movie? Most movies are, in a way. All Disney movies have happy endings, don't they? Being predictable is not a sign of being a BAD movie. I found DIVERGENT getting more interesting and interesting as frames passed by. It has good special effects and the acting is quite bearable. Trust me, I've seen far, far worse movies that end up being praised as the ultimate in cinema. If you didn't like the movie, that's OK, you're entitled to think and say whatever, just as I'm entitled to say that DIVERGENT was a truly entertaining, interesting and fast paced futuristic movie. If you ask me, I enjoyed it far more than the over-blown HUNGER GAME series.","

"Divergent","mreynolds9662","6 July 2014","This movie was terrible. It was awful. And infuriating. It made no sense. This movie is the epitome of crap. In fact, instead of watching this near 2 1/2 hour movie, watch a piece of crap. It will have a better plot than this flick. The first hour and forty-five minutes (precisely) are spent on the wrong thing. It makes reference to the ""government"" (cough CAPITOL) to being some sort of evil, but rather focuses on Tris becoming part of a cult. It doesn't even make clear what they do. It gives no reason to why they are in ""factions"". There were so many plot holes I would have thought Tommy Wiseau wrote it. The guys name is Four. Four. Apparently the author of the book thought, ""Well, anyone who reads this is a moron anyway."" Four. Why? Why? WHY???? I understand that this garbage was only put together to make money, but did they have to assume everyone is an idiot? Couldn't they at least let it make sense? Or shorter? Or less cheesy? Or better acted? Or more focused? Or more intelligent? There was a point when Tris argues with Kate Winslet's character that them choosing isn't a matter of free will. Or at least she almost does. Right when it seems like the movie has any brain they shut it down in a hurry. There is way too much wrong about this movie. If I continue I will only be hurting myself by spending more than ten minutes thinking about this movie.","

"Divergent","Jac23443","29 March 2014","If this is truly based off a book, then God help those who actually thought this movie was good. Personally I have not read the books, although from what I saw in this movie, I am glad I never have. What kind of movie is this anyway? There was nothing pinnacle about this movie, nothing iconic, nothing that caused me to want to get up out of my seat and scream at the top of my lungs that was incredible because its all been done before. The army being controlled for God's sake was a pathetic attempt at being the slightest bit menacing, if menacing was what they were going for, it was pathetic. Then don't even get me started on the point where Tris gets to Kate Winslet, seriously!! No security to guard the most important person in the whole movie, the person who was behind the taking over of ABNIGATION, seriously?! Okay. There was barely any character development in any of the other characters except for Tris and Four and even that was done poorly (the revelation that the father beat Four when he was younger, if the movie really wanted fear to be felt, my God they failed). This movie SCREAMED young adult book, but then again the Hunger Games was a young adult trilogy, and all I could do was cover my mouth and hope the characters didn't die, and I know there is a part one and two coming out soon. This movie left no cliffhanger, nothing to the imagination, nothing to make a person ponder positively over what they just saw, it just happened to happen. There was nothing that dazzled and that is something I am noticing in most movies coming out these past few years. There isn't an elaborately put together story, its just put together in the way that's most clear to its audience, it is almost as if creators of movies nowadays don't want a thinking audience. AND THAT IS SAD, as sad as this movie was. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, due to its soggy and cringe-worthy script, poorly placed emotion, and over-told story. Thank God I got Game of Thrones, the Hunger Games, and Marvel movies to save me from movies like this. Seriously folks do not waste your money on this movie! I am giving this movie a five out of ten due to the fact that it tried, but it wasn't anywhere near as great as it could've been.","

"Divergent","scott1-912-252003","22 May 2014","I took my 12 year old son to the movies on a ""guys day out"" last weekend. We left Mom and sister/daughter at home. Anyway, we had a great time and it was a good movie to take my kid to see. I must say this isn't a hugely serious review, but a review nonetheless. When a movie leaves me thinking about it for days or weeks after I watch it, there is something to that. There is also something to be said about how this story relates to modern present society. Square pegs go into square holes, and when someone is too divergent, they seem to suffer in our shallow, worker bee society. The movie was entertaining from the beginning to the end, however I felt like there was no closure in the final scene. This is probably because the story is a series, as it should be, if it's based on the books. I loved the way the movie made me think about myself. This is where the genius of this film blossoms. Everyone I've talked to about the film, and everything I've read on the Divergent fan site is rooted in how people feel about themselves and how they fit into our current society and culture. Because all the excitement, plot, and direction of the film is borne out of the Dauntless faction, I've noticed that everyone who's watched the movie now wants to be Dauntless. Why not? It's exciting and they are pretty bad-ass with the black clothing and tattoos. For me personally, I was Dauntless as a former cop who sports his share of ink, but now a full fledged Candor or maybe even an Abnegation since I'm one of five running our local government. Really, I'm Divergent like most people. We generally don't fit into one category as human beings and that's the moral of the story here. Human nature is eternal and cannot be curbed no matter how you structure your society. The film as a whole was really well done. The plot flows, the tension is always there, the mystery seeps in now and then, and the action is outstanding. The lead actress is pretty, yet tough and smart, but young and has a lot to learn. That is the point though. Bottom line is that I loved the movie and I'm still thinking about it a week later. I will definitely own the movie when it comes out on disc. I can't wait to play it for my wife and daughter.I also found out that the lead actress is from my home town and went to my high school. I'm more than double her age, but it is very cool that she is from my neighborhood and went to my school. Because of this, the movie has even more meaning to it because, again, the story made me think about how I relate to this world and where I fit in.You can also take the faction quiz on the fan site. Everyone in my family took the test. My son and I came out as Candor the honest. My wife Dauntless the brave, and my daughter Erudite the intelligent. Of course this was just for fun, but interesting because there is truth in those results. (my candor is coming out again). This movie will be very successful because it's a lot of fun and a great story.Update (Spoilers!): I read the book and really enjoyed it. There are some differences from book to movie, but I have to say the movie (all things considering) did a great job with keeping the story in line with the book. Tris was never last on the points board. She was first initiate by the end. The stun darts were paintballs in the book. The movie skipped the very important scene with the factionless man on the street. Mom didn't sneak into the warehouse. She came to the pit on visiting day. Tris never visited her brother, didn't fight the first day, mastered the gun the first day, wasn't going to be executed by three with guns, but by drowning in a tank, etc. Lots of details left out or changed in the movie, but it was still done very well and reading the book AFTER watching the movie didn't ruin it.","

"Divergent","anisandaru","12 May 2019","Divergent is a science fiction film in action, fantasy and adventure. The divergent was officially released on March 18, 2014 in Los Angeles. The film was directed by Neli Burger, Evan Daughterty, and Vanessa Taylor.
The divergent tells of the city of Chicago which was destroyed by war. To create peace, 5 factions formed according to personality. Abnegation that is unselfish and simple. Erudite is smart and prioritizes science. Good and peaceful Amity, Candor who prioritizes honesty, and Dauntless who is brave and free. Whereas Divergents are people who have more than one faction in their personality.
Children who are 16 years old must take a test to choose a faction. After the test, Tris has 3 results there are Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite. Tris must keep his identity as a Divergent. During the selection ceremony, Tris finally chose Dauntless. It turns out that only 10 people will be elected as official Dauntless members. Because of abstinence and intelligence, Tris managed to become a member of Dauntless.
But chaos occurs when Erudite controls Dauntless's brain to attack Abnegation. Tris who is not affected by serum pretends like the others. At that time, Tris knew that For was also a Divergent. Eventually an attack was carried out by Erudite against Abnegation. In addition, Divergent hunting is also underway. However, all can be thwarted by Tris, Four, Marcus, Caleb, and Peter. The five of them fled with the train go to beyond the wall.
This movie have an easy to understand path. In addition, the acting of the players successfully supports the story. Divergent films are in accordance with the character of teenagers who want to find their identity","

"Divergent","Prismark10","25 July 2014","Twilight found a teen female audience. The Hunger Games found a teen female audience. They also sold a shed-load of books.Now its the turn of Divergent but this film fails. Like The Hunger Games this is a future dystopian society but this one has ever running trains that never stop at train stations. It certainly gives the phrase 'a running jump' new meaning. Even a bit of Ender's Game is thrown in here.In a Chicago which is now a massively walled city after a devastating war, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave, and Erudite the intelligent. However there is sixth group that are the faction- less who are outside society and regarded as outcasts. No one seem to questions the role of these outsiders who are left destitute.Members join a faction based on their choice but are given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Her father serves on the ruling council along with the head of Abnegation, Marcus Eaton (Ray Stevenson).Each year when kids turn 16 they go through a serum based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit. Beatrice test shows attributes of several factions meaning she is Divergent. She is told to keep this a secret as Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them. During her choosing ceremony she becomes a Dauntless.So like The Hunger Games we are told that the ruling government has magically found peace after a devastating war and everyone in society is happy apart from the faction-less. We see people happily working the land, some helping each other and the protectors running and climbing things. It certainly looks like Prozac Nation.Beatrice suddenly joins other Dauntless teenagers running and jumping in and out of trains and soon becomes a super soldier. Yet she does not realise that her training superiors are less comrade in arms and are actually horrid and mean, changing the rulebook. People who fail various stages of training become faction-less and this does not ring any alarm bells that society is not what its cracked up to be.However there is plot afoot for Erudite leader (Kate Winslet, unrecognisable in a blonde wig) to get rid of other Divergents and take over the government by getting rid of Eaton.Apart from a silly plot that is full of holes, the acting is rather weak, the characters have no charisma and the film is dull, looks cheap, overlong which makes it drag even more.Twilight had a romantic sub plot that sucked viewers in as well as dealing with issues of teens in a new town. The Hunger Games had Jennifer Lawrence, a genuine star in the making as well as the survival concept. This film has very little to offer apart from mixed messages. You soon forget which group is who and of course any viewer will realise that humans simply cannot be compartmentalised so easily as they do in this film, we all have certain mixed attributes. Therefore we are all faction-less.","

"Divergent","cjgrayso","16 April 2014","This is perfect storm of bad movie making: a stupid story, bad acting and bad directing. Who is ultimately to blame? Money grubbing CEO's. Who else? Thanks to the mega-success of the Hunger Games and Harry Potter, Hollywood's scouring young adult books, like some pedophile in a playground, looking for new material to get their greasy hands on. Divergent is one of those series. I've not read the books, but in the movie, you belong to one of 5 factions. Our heroine does not - she's divergent - and that apparently frightens the powers that be. Why? Because individualism is seen as a threat. In much the way independent film makers are perceived a threat in Hollywood. What follows is one inane, dumb, idiotic scene after another. I was rolling my eyes most of the time or laughing out loud at some of the nonsense I was watching. I almost got up to leave, but it was like watching a train wreck. That would be more entertaining.","

"Divergent","clubber2k","12 January 2015","I ignored this movie at first since it was released close to hunger games, looked the same, and had the least good movie trailer. but that trailer did it no justice.this is a movie for those with some imagination. likes dis-utopian worlds or maybe apocalyptic worlds. some said the story is unbelievable. how can everyone be a work drones except one woman? well I'll tel you, this is exaggerated but it still reminds me of old social / communism ideal world. everyone has its place and does what he is told for joint harmony. this reminds me of my parents always doing what is needed what they are told and expecting me to do something just because everyone else do it. and like in communism everything is good and peaceful and right. except the leaders which can do what they want to shape it. oh and kill those who pose a threat to them. yep communism.but no there's a new generation. just like my gen. the Y generation, that stopped doing what we are told, and instead started to ask ""Y"" questions - so did this one girl. there are others like her but she had the best instinctive to make a change (you'll see). all the charterers have a relevant background to how they act because of who they were. now they choose to do things different because of who they really are now. and that is what makes the shift. this could have happened a few years before or in another 100 years. when doesn't matter, only they who and why do.so whats wrong with it? 1. well it is a bit cheesy at times. they romantic part is predictable, simple yet believable in the movie world. 2. somewhat predictable. the story doesn't hide the main characters and the big issue, this is not a spy/cops thriller. there is no big twist. you enjoy following the characters and chain of events and how the characters react to it.I think this movie does everything hunger games did not: 1. its shorter. no need to wast your money and times. 2. the world is much more believable. not relevant but this is still our world. not a fully crazy imaginary one. our world just something happened. only this city matters. maybe there are others, maybe there are not. some said that hey don't understand how a poor civilization built this city but the civ isn't poor at all. its spends its wealth where it needs. some parts look bad, some look good.so final words, this is movie is a fun ride all along. those who didn't enjoy it are either too oldish (45+) to understand the idea (those who said this is a teen movie should realize under 40 isn't' teen, they are just too old for it). or maybe too dense to see beyond the basic simple story to see the message. this is our world. serfs and lords. kids and parents. workers and business men. those who do as they are told, those who try to control the lesser ones and those who try to find the in between. do what you want because you believe it to be right. if you are one of those, you will enjoy this great and fun movie. I know I did.9/10 from me. yep. and I'm not a teenager. 30+ straight male, how do you like that?","

Sounds like ""The Hunger Games"", doesn't it? Well, ""Divergent"" also uses this story. I had never heard of this series before the first movie got released. Having seen the movie, I can only conclude that they simply used the idea behind ""The Hunger Games"" and added a bit of Harry Potter (the serum-induced psychological test to determine a person's faction reminded me of the Sorting Hat).So, this franchise doesn't come across as anything original. I wish that someone would film Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Years of Rice and Salt"".","

"Divergent","Spazplayer20","21 March 2014","DIVERGENT delivers where so many of the recent young adult novel film adaptations have failed. I saw this film not having read the book and on its own it stands very well. First off the bad:1) action sequences feel slow and not natural. You can tell that the actors were not particularly familiar with hand to hand combat, not to say their characters weren't supposed to be but even when they're supposed to know how to fight it feels lackluster. 2) obvious age difference between the two main characters. 3) high school Clich feel for the first half of the film. Now with that said ^ here is what Worked: 1) length. Often we see film adaptations of novels try and cram everything into 90 or 100 mins but Divergent takes its time. Normally this would be a drawback but the film makes good use of the extra time (the film is 145 mins) to really progress. 2) the performances of the main characters are solid. Nothing amazing but the dynamic between the two main characters works well. - the visual style of the film is very good. The dystopian city of Chicago is very well realized. 3) brings to light moral and societal problems. Suprizingly deep for a young adult film.OVERALL divergent is a good film. It fails in few places but succeeds in most that count. With the failure of young adult movies such as Percy Jackson, Divergent healthily separates itself from them. I would recommend seeing it. There WILL be a sequel.","

No, if something is good you'll find it's quality even if you're not a lover of a specific movie type.Some details: - acting - it's as artificial as the whole script itself so i cannot blame the actors - script- look above - the whole concept of society being divided to factions, im fine with that, but excluding/killing people who e.g. feel compassion and declared themselves to be soldiers, thats just ridiculous. - oo, and that hand combat technique of holding your front-to-oponent elbow high- try that in real life and it wont be a long one.To summarize, i agree with critics on this one.","

"Divergent","galdude9021","19 July 2014","I was actually pretty excited about watching this movie. My cousin thought it was great and better than Hunger games, so I read the books before I watched the movie. I liked the books, but there were a few things I wasn't satisfied about. The relationship between Tris and Four is confusing and spontaneous, completely out of the blue and random. In the movie it is worse. They barely know each other, Tris' ear gets cut from Four, then Tris is making out with Four topless. They didn't include a lot of the important characters, like Uriah and Peter's crew. They barely acknowledged the characters they did put into the movie and there seemed to be no importance in them. Al's suicide was a big thing in the book and it didn't really make an impact in the movie, there was no significance, I wouldn't have felt any emotion if I hadn't read the book. Will, Christina, Tris and Al's friendship is too muted and you don't really get to know any of the characters well, the character development was non-existent, . Four of the characters I couldn't really tell apart from the others, Will, Al, Peter and Drew looked pretty much identical. Too much is left out and there are too many changes added to the movie that make no sense. In Tris' fear landscape it seems that Four is trying to rape her and she has to violently fight him off. In the book it is playful and she ends up laughing it off. Edward's knife stabbing in the eye accident is also left out and that was an incredibly important scene.This movie just really disappointed me, I never really get disappointed with movies, but this just frustrated me too much.The books and movie both had great potential but were just a little bit off.","

"Divergent","AustinOswald","19 March 2014","As a stand alone movie, Divergent was great. The cinematography was decent, but the storyline alone was marvelous. The action keeps you on the edge of your seat. The romance was well... romantic. It may have been a little too sappy and forced to me, but still cute. All in all, the movie was a perfect blend of comedy, mystery, action, drama, and romance. Thus, a new fan base was created.The only problems with this movie were the acting was a bit shaky at some points and it diverged from the books a lot too (see what I did there). The characters were well developed in the movie as well as the book, but some details about the characters were left out from the movie that were in the book. The settings and storyline did the same thing as well.","

"Divergent","neil-476","11 April 2014","In post-apocalyptic Chicago, the Sorting Hat puts Katniss Everdeen in Slytherin, not Griffindor.This film, which appeared in the UK with no pre-publicity at all, no trailers, nothing, is apparently based on the first of a trilogy of Young Adult novels, which is curious for what is clearly - given cast and production values - a Major Motion Picture.The good news is that it is quite nicely realised - a good budget, solid production values on screen (some nice eye candy), good and well-delivered action, a strong cast, and a pleasing central performance from Shailene Woodley as Katniss. Sorry, ""Triss"".The bad news is that is so busy trying to emulate the Hunger Games and Harry Potter transposed into a cookie-cutter post-apocalyptic dystopian scenario that it often forgets to be its own thing. I know my synopsis above was somewhat sarcastic, but I honestly sat there thinking ""This bit's from Hunger Games. This bit's from Harry Potter. Oh, Hunger Games again."" This is a very derivative piece which hasn't worked hard enough to forge its own identity (or hide its sources, if the two are not the same). Which may explain the lack of publicity.Oh, and the fictional status quo of the five factions-based society (this film's version of The Hunger Games' Panem) makes little sense when examined closely, and raises more questions than it answers. Someone didn't think things through.So my verdict is that it is somewhat dumb, overfamiliar with its sources, but not unenjoyable.","

"Divergent","planktonrules","7 February 2015","To me, 2014 seems to be the year of the shallow attempt to recapture the financial magic of ""The Hunger Games"". First you had ""Divergent"" and then you had ""Maze Runner""---and all three games are aimed at the same audience and are pretty much the same movie in so many ways. All are set in a manipulative futuristic dystopia and all are aimed at creating franchises that will bring in the audiences like lemmings--ready to toss wads of cash at the studios. Don't get me wrong--these aren't bad movies but they are clearly lacking in creativity because the plots are, beneath it all, EXACTLY the same. All feature a plucky nobody who ends up somehow being different--and able to destroy the evil system despite the odds. Whatever....all I know is that because they all follow this formula there really isn't a lot to distinguish them. I say just watch ""The Hunger Games"" films and be done with it.So what do I like about this film? After all, it's not a bad movie and it's pretty well made. I think the look of this futuristic dystopian Chicago is pretty amazing. I loved seeing huge swaths of the city gone green as well as the drained Lake Michigan--not to mention all of the buildings in serious states of disrepair (though this former part may not be all that different from some parts of the city today). It looked great and gave you a wonderful futuristic look. Apart from this, the script was mildly diverting and it did hold my attention. The acting was generally good. On the negative side, too many times I felt as if I needed Cliff Notes from the book to understand exactly what was happening and several times there seemed to be logical jumps that could only be explained if you assume the characters were reading these as well. I was really annoyed late in the film where the heroine is out on her mission to stop the genocide--with dozens and dozens of killers chasing her. Again and again, she kept stopping...stopping to cry, stopping to catch her breath and just stopping for dramatic effect. Hello?! Folks are chasing after you with guns....KEEP MOVING!!!! Stop stopping!!! Yet, you can only assume she knew that she could save the day so there was no hurry! My overall feeling about this one is that it's good that the film has come and gone from the theaters, as I'd never recommend you pay your $10 to go see this one. However, as a DVD rental, it's about right.","

"Divergent","kosmasp","15 August 2014","Are you the target audience? Are you female, possibly still a teenager? If you answer yes to both questions and will most likely also have read the book (I haven't), than the answer to what you think of this, is likely to be different from mine. Still I watched this with a female friend of mine and she was much ruder than me, when it came to evaluate the movie.It is a different take on the Hunger Games I reckon, though I have no idea what the time-line is on those books. The whole idea about classes and deciding your own fate is the backbone and the one thing that sort of works here. What does not work is the ""love story"", again reducing teenage girls into messes who want to be treated as bad as possible, to fall in love with that ""hard shell, soft heart"" kinda person. It's like the more the guy pushes her off, the more she wants him.We also get the clichés we expect to see. I can recommend the ""Honest Trailer"" to this, just search for it online and you'll find it amusing too, I'm sure. It's what it is, the target audience cannot wait for the sequel(s)","

"Divergent","Coventry","14 January 2019","Okay, apparently the post 2010-world likes dystopian Sci-Fi/Fantasy fables made for, and preferably starring, teenage girls. I realize I'm just an old whiner, but these nowadays dystopian stories are soft and weak compared to the terrific and similarly themed films of the 70s, like ""Soylent Green"" or ""Z.P.G"". What was the typical and almost even logical thing to do for Hollywood producers upon noticing the tremendous success of the adaptation of Suzanne Collins' ""The Hunger Games""? Find more reminiscent novels to turn into massively hyped and over-funded film franchises, of course! Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"", ""Limitless"") chose for the books written by the young author Veronica Roth. The main idea behind ""Divergent"" certainly isn't too bad. In the soulless Chicago of the near future, society is divided into five different factions that each have their own color of clothing to illustrate what type of people they are, like grey for abnegation or blue for erudite. Children are born in the factions of their parents and can remain there for the rest of their lives, or they can choose to move to one of the four other factions at the age of sixteen. There exist psychological tests to help you decide which faction suits you the best, because once you made the choice it's forbidden to change again. When the seemingly ordinary teen Beatrice takes the test, however, the outcome is ""divergent"" and this should be kept secret as divergent people are considered uncontrollable, rebellious and a menace to this formula of a peacefully structured society. Beatrice makes the instinctive but illogical choice to join the Dauntless faction, where she must battle daily to become accepted, becomes infatuated by the hunky but mysterious Four and stumbles upon a conspiracy to re-arrange the factions that looks an awful lot like genocide. As said, ""Divergent"" certainly isn't bad and even qualifies as decent entertainment on a Friday night with a bucket of popcorn and a medium-sized beer, but the script is so frustratingly unsurprising and predictable! The supposedly clever plot twists, like the dark secrets of Four or the mysterious background of Tris' mother Nathalie, are so abundantly obvious that you honestly begin to question the level of intellect of the target audience. There isn't a single thing happening in ""Divergent"" that you can't see coming from three railways stations away and, astonishingly enough, Neil Burger doesn't do anything to put his mark on the film. The action footage is very tame, clearly because the producers wanted to maintain the PG-13 rating no matter what, and the use of special effects or futuristic gimmicks is kept to a minimum, which makes you wonder on what they spent the massive $80 million budget. Perhaps on Kate Winslet's erudite haircut?","

"Divergent","harry_tk_yung","21 March 2014","The opening scene shows a familiar post-apocalyptic city labeled as Chicago, inviting the audience's expectation of Mad-Max-ish fodder. But something does not look quite right – the city is not in complete rabbles, but instead has more than half of the skyscrapers still in good conditions. Then we see people, crowds we expect to see in a normal big city, carrying on with life in orderly, civilized manner. This is made possible, as we are told, because of the wall, which immediately reminds me of ""Warm Bodies"" (2013) in which a similar wall (in nature if not in grandeur) keeps out zombies. What THIS wall keeps out is unknown, even at the end of the movie (at least to those who have not read the books), setting up the scene for future installments.Inside the city we have an orderly post-war world where human beings are divided into 5 factions living in harmony, at least superficially: Abnegation (selfless), Erudite (intelligent), Dauntless (brave), Amity (kind) and Candor (honest). At coming-of-age, protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley), originally from Abnegation, goes through the mandatory character test which helps (but not dictates) which faction to choose. Following the motto ""faction before blood"", once the choice is made, the individual leaves family behind, unless it happens to be in the same faction as chosen. The complication in Tris's case is that the test is inconclusive, marking her as a ""Divergent"", a rare non-conformist considered a danger to the entire community, usually hunted down and exterminated. The kind-hearted test administrator (Maggie Q) suppresses the damning revelation, rendering it possible for Tris to exercise her choice just like everybody else. She opts for Dauntless, leaving her model family of loving parents and brother (who similarly chooses Erudite).The longest sequence of the movie, Tris's painful (in more ways than one) training and ultimate acceptance into Dauntless, is predictability institutionalized. That is not to say that it is incompetently rendered, but just reflects my summary line. Most important, she meets Four (yes, his name and I don't know if there is any connection to Number Four in ""I am Number Four"") (Theo James) the good guy in the pair of good-trainer-bad-trainer, with predictable developments.At 139 minutes, this movie is too long. The two leads are competent, action-adequate and very good to look at. You can't help but wish, however, that Woodley has more material to work with, remembering her Golden Globe nominated role as George Clooney's character's daughter. Two stellar supports, Ashley Judd playing Tris's mother and Kate Winslet playing the ambitious Erudite leader, are welcomed additions but their roles are somewhat lacking in dimensions.I note that just like the various YA adapted movies before it, ""Divergent"" sequel installments are already in pre-production. Although I won't be exactly holding my breath to discover what the wall tries to keep out, I'll probably watch them, if only because they are not in 3D (hopefully).","

"Divergent","heatherderringer","3 July 2014","This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichés from recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a confusing mess. Lead actor Shalene Woodsley does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. Furthermore, the movie is largely devoid of a coherent premise (although, in fairness, there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).*MILD SPOILERS* It's rubbish.*END SPOILERS* Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous dystopian tale, check out the Korean film Snowpiercer (2013).","

"Divergent","iconic-sr","20 September 2014","Brief Overview: Divergent is a movie based off the book by Veronica Roth also titled, ""Divergent."" I am going to start off by saying that I did enjoy this film, but there were a lot of bland moments and plot points that were covered in similar movies.The Positives: One thing that I really enjoyed was how well the movie stayed true to the book, starting with the cast. Shailene Woodley plays the leading role Tris, who is an awkward and remote teenage girl living in a futuristic society divided into factions. Woodley has also in the 2014 release, ""A Fault in Our Stars"" which has been met with positive reviews. She was also scheduled to play Mary Jane in the 2014, ""The Amazing Spider Man 2,"" but her scenes were removed from the final cut (and for Spider Man fans, she may return for the third installment, maybe). What I liked about Shailene's portrayal is that she does do a good job playing a plain personality, and just being plain in general. She was definitely not going to win a beauty contest when this movie was shot (which may be a problem for some), but that is the way she is supposed to be. The book makes important notes that her appearance does not stand out and she is somewhat of an outcast. Moving on to other performances, Theo James plays the role of one of her faction leaders, also known as ""Four."" He also lives up to his novel counterpart by giving the vibe that he lives on a completely different planet with virtually no tolerance. Another positive aspect is the chemistry between Tris and Four which really makes the movie stand out.The Negatives: In many ways, this film feels like a branch off of ""The Hunger Games."" Just watching the scenery, action, and the way the camera is handled gives me some Deja Vu. Also a lot of the character traits for the protagonist are strikingly similar. On a different note, ""Divergent"" lacks the ""explosiveness"" required to keep full attention of the general audience. I just feel that the script was slightly under par and maybe even disappointing for all the potential this franchise has.The Conclusion: I gave this film an overall rating of 7/10. I think this film would be more satisfying if you have previously read the book, but it is by no means a bad movie if you haven't. I recommend this film for most viewers.","

"Divergent","sheilah-953-788608","20 March 2014","To start off this review let me clarify that I have read the books, and read them not long before seeing the movie, so they were very fresh in my mind. There were issues I had with the book, and although I liked the books overall, there were many things that I didn't like about them.This movie I think is an excellent version, as many of the aspects that I found annoying or didn't like from the book are not included, or at least not focused on. To me this made the story that much better.The actors in the movie did a very good job, I found that both leads (Shailene Woodley as Beatrice Prior and Theo James as Four/Tobias) did excellent jobs in their roles. I was initially very hesitant, and didn't want to like them as they were not at all how I pictured the characters, but I am a complete convert. In fact, Theo James did his role so well that I honestly cannot picture that character in any other way except the way he portrayed it. Many of the supporting characters were superb in their small roles as well, Ashley Judd, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q, Jai Courtney, Zoe Kravitz, and Tony Goldwyn, all stood out to me as being excellent in their roles. Some of the other actors I found a bit weak in their parts, but I also realize that might have been because they were not given enough screen time to actually build the nuances of their characters to portray them well.The cinematography and editing I thought was also very well done. I really liked the costume and set designs for this movie, and how well they reflected the factions. From the clothing to their homes, it was all very well thought out on how such a civilization would actually love.The script was also excellent. At no point did I want to role my eyes because it was too silly (which happens a lot with these YA books turned into movies), and it managed to keep you interested in what each character was saying.The story adaptation, again, was also very well done. I cannot think of any part they left out that I felt was absolutely necessary to include, they did very minor story changes, but I also realize that is because to include them would have meant they left an open ended story for viewers who hadn't read the books (which would be very annoying).Overall, I think this is an excellent movie, and I would highly advise anyone who has read the books to go see it, and if you drag your friends who haven't read the books they will enjoy it as well.","

"Divergent","prince_c3","23 March 2014","I usually don't write reviews and on occasion when the movie is really amazing or when movie is really worst, but that movie still end up with above 6 ratings by Critics. So Divergent is one of those movies where producers, directors and production houses instead of spending money and time on script, editing, acting and direction decided to spend all the energy on publicity and promotions. More than 90% of users reviews are negative and still the movie given as 7.7 stars I mean isn't is the biggest proof that producers well paid the critics too. Well, before the movie release they start promoting movie which is the typical case of every big budget movies but they started promoting actress and actor of the movie in every magazine and newspapers, basically they wanted to create a reel life imitating real life scenario between the leading pair the way it happened with Twilight series and because of that, the Twilight series otherwise one of the worse Vampire/Ware-wolf series made lot of money they bank on Kristen and Robert Pattison love chemistry, so the production houses tried to bank on Shailene & Theo chemistry in real life, but it seems that Shailene is not only pretty but she is smart as well, she has lot of potential and she didn't play that game. SO many comments already written about the flaws in the movie I don't think I need to reiterate them here. Overall very disappointing movie in all departments. The only thing is Shailene Woodley and I believe she is promising but still she is no Jennifer Lawrence and I don't think Divergent would become Hunger Games series. Another bad thing about this movie is unlike Twilight series which has low stars ratings which is justified this movie got 7.7 stars rating is ridiculous.","

"Divergent","HaiisamAshraf","27 January 2015","Divergent"" is all about identity—about searching your soul and determining who you are and how you fit in as you emerge from adolescence to adulthood. So it's all too appropriate that the film version of the wildly popular young adult novel struggles a bit to assert itself as it seeks to appeal to the widest possible audience.It's the conundrum so many of these types of books face as they become pop-culture juggernauts and film franchises: which elements to keep to please the fervent fans and which to toss in the name of maintaining a lean, speedy narrative? The ""Harry Potter"" and ""Hunger Games"" movies—which ""Divergent"" resembles in myriad ways—were mostly successful in finding that balance.In bringing the first novel of Veronica Roth's best-selling trilogy to the screen, director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and screenwriters Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor have included key moments and images but tweaked others to streamline the mythology and move the story along. The results can be thrilling but the film as a whole feels simultaneously overlong and emotionally truncated.","

"Divergent","bellino-angelo2014","19 January 2023","I heard for the first time about the DIVERGENT franchise in 2019 but never been interested in seeing them because here on IMDB they have mixed reviews and look like copied from the MAZE RUNNER franchise. But last September I finally saw it because of most of the cast members and while I didn't loved it, I still liked it and found it worth the wait before watching.The movie is set in a dystopian future in Chicago where society is divided in five factions: Abnegation, Dauntless, Amity, Candor and Erudite. The rest, the so-called Factionless have no status or privilege. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) was born in Abnegation and her father Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) serves on the ruling council: Beatrice's test results prove that she is a Divergent, and since Divergents can think independently they are seen as a threat for the social order. So Beatrice joins forces with a group of other Divergents that are in exile and try their best for stopping Jeanine Matthews' (Kate Winslet) conspiracy. She won't succedd but since they made sequels, you can guess what we'll see.The first thing I noticed when the film began was that the sets were so futuristic and unique... not your typical city of the future, that's for sure! There were various stunts that looked a bit like those of the MISSION IMPOSSIBLEs and were cool. The acting was decent, nothing exceptional. Woodley is a very competent lead, same goes for Goldwyn as her dad and for Winslet as the villain, and the others (such as Miles Teller and Jai Courtney) are on par with them. The soundtrack wasn't forgettable but still not that important.Overall, an ok movie that somehow achieved a cult following. I wouldn't put it in that category but more in the category of decent entertainment and nothing more.","

I absolutely like how there is less romance and more substance this movie has compared to other similarly themed movies. The casting crew did a great job by choosing the lead actor and actress. The depth of the characters development is proper. Thus, this movie is also entertaining for adults. I sense good chemistry among the casts. The lead actress successfully portrays a confused yet brave teenager and captures innocence, while the lead actor renders a mature vibe that help save the movie from being categorized as another superficial teenage love story.","

"Divergent","Leofwine_draca","24 January 2016","DIVERGENT is another in a long line of recent Hollywood 'young adult' movies, inevitably based on long-running book series and designed to cash in on the same market as the TWILIGHT saga or the HARRY POTTER franchise. This one's almost exactly the same as THE HUNGER GAMES, featuring a dystopian future world (is there any other type?) split into five different factions. Teenagers must choose a faction in which to live for the rest of their lives.Yes, it's exactly like somebody watched or read the first Harry Potter film/novel, decided that the whole sorting hat thing was a cool motif and that they could write a whole book series with it applied to real life. Unfortunately, that opening plot point is the only thing this film has going for it, as the rest of it is mere set-up. We watch characters interacting, getting to know one another, and training - lots and lots of TRAINING - for over two hours before an action narrative sort of hits in the last half hour.The lack of incident and completely predictability of what's taking place on screen - we've been through all this training stuff before in the first two HUNGER GAMES movies and it was boring then - make DIVERGENT a real chore to sit through. I don't know why these films have to have such lengthy running times and so much exposition when all of the stuff we see could have been depicted in a mere half an hour with a handful of pithy moments instead of endless self-indulgence and stretched-out moments. CGI training sequences are not something I enjoy watching.What I did like about DIVERGENT is that it has decent characterisation for once, much better than in the Jennifer Lawrence franchise. Shailene Woodley is a decent young actress and completely sympathetic in the lead role, and newcomer Theo James makes an impact as her mentor. The supporting cast features the impressive likes of Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, and Tony Goldwyn, alongside more minor bits for Kate Winslet and Maggie Q, and overall the calibre of the acting is strong. It's just a shame that there's no story to go with the characters; I can accept and enjoy well-plotted movies without characterisation, but a film with good characters and no plot is doomed from the outset. We'll see where the sequels go with this...","

Maybe it's just me, but unfortunately I can't find a single positive thing to say. Except perhaps that its produced quite OK, but which movie isn't today. So for lack of anything better to say, I'm just gonna finish those ten lines by repeating my second sentence: Infantile plot, boring dialogue, predictable and totally unconvincing.

When I saw Beautiful Creatures I was so upset because they changed so much! I loved the books but hated the movie. And so did a lot of people apparently, because they aren't making the second one. But with Divergent they followed the book very well! If you didn't read the books you should. If you like The Hunger Games you will like Divergent! The actors did a great job. They really captured the personalities of the characters in the book. The thing that bugged me just a little bit about this movie was that they didn't explore Caleb's (Ansel Elgort) character a little more. He has a sort of big part to play in the books. Other than that I really loved the movie. I have a good feeling they will make the other books into movies too.

The people who complain about it being too slow are just folks who want every movie to be action all the time. The movie has plenty of action, but it also has humor, romance, drama, philosophy, and just general dystopian ingredients. The actors were phenomenal, the music --- well, I for one am getting the sound track, the story is very relevant to our surveillance society, and the pacing of the story and editing was just perfect. Along with Hunger Games, this has to be the best teen dystopian story on screen. I give it a 10, not because I think there were too many negative reviews, but because it frankly deserves a 10.","

Divergent's sets, back grounds and supporting actors create a good back ground environment. There is a teenage female lead telling the story.

They are called erudite, dauntless (athletic militaristic), abnegation (selfless service and government), amity (happy farmers) and candour. Each teen must choose a clan for life. For no apparent reason, the choice cannot be changed. Oddly, even the erudite faction has no educational or training requirements for admission. If the clan eventually rejects them after hazing, they became factionless, similar to homeless in our society.Our heroine goes for a sort of career counselling where they pull out the stops on CGI. It is quite entertaining and mystifying.Unfortunately, our heroine chooses the mindless, loutish, tattooed, militaristic, boorish dauntless faction who do nothing but jump on trains, climb buildings, fight and run in packs.The world is a Republican wet dream where everyone is pitted against each other and the weakest are shamed, deprived and tormented.After a promising start, the movie degenerates into a sort of boot camp army training film. BORING.The whole premise of the movie that having more than one sort of skill is weird and dangerous makes no sense as does the rule you may never change factions.This is a movie for teenagers who fantasise about joining a criminal gang.","

I would have given it a ten, but there were some important things in the book they didn't include. Uriah and Edward were not there. I know they hired an actor for Edward, but his part was so small I didn't even realize he was there. Because of that, the butter knife scene was also not there.

"Divergent","cltyler1","20 March 2014","Divergent is gripping and intelligently brought to life on the big screen from the director who brought us ""Limitless"" and ""The Illusionist."" Are we seeing something of similar essence with the ""Hunger Games"" series? Yes. However, my personal take was that the characters were more engaging and the plot was as well in this film. Shailene is excellent at the helm, and really brings forth a convincing portrayal of a heroine battling in a world where chaos and tragedy envelope the characters. Her graceful emergence from shy personality to dominance is done artfully and really speaks to her ability as an actress. Theo James is also exceptional in the co-pilot role and almost effortlessly seems to pull off the bad boy with standards persona in a manner I haven't seen since Will Smith in his prime. The plot is high octane and especially more gritty than I first imagined. The emotion raw in intensity and empathic build. As a guy who was just going to this film to act as arm candy and a shoulder to lean on for my highly enthused girlfriend, I can write this piece while honestly saying that my eyes were glued to the screen the entirety of the film and was pleased to see this film do such an excellent job at developing both the plot and characters involved in it.

I'm an avid fan of science fiction all the way back to Metropolis to Buck Rogers to Star Trek to Barbarella to Star Wars to Avatar. What makes this series so cool is the social fiction more than the science fiction. Not to downplay cool science fiction threads and special effects along with the stunts but the future's social structure in this premiere of the series is just absolutely brilliant. Many science fiction stories take you on a journey,adventure,exploration beyond our world but I always like social fiction based upon our existing world and what could be. The thing about movies is being taken away to that larger than life essence for a while, Divergent is no exception; except that maybe it does it more exceptional than most movies do.","

"Divergent","gumperman","25 March 2014","When first hearing of this film and seeing the first trailer, I didn't know what to think about it. It didn't excitement me much and all the way up to it's release, I didn't feel it had that same kind of vibe that 'The Hunger Games' had. A vibe that it was a must see film. Then I heard a sample track from the score, composed by Junkie XL. It was great, and it made me want to see the movie a little bit. Well that and I wanted to see if it was actually a great film, like The Hunger Games was. Plus I do like the main star, Shailene Woodley. Well, I just saw it today and here is what I think. The music is great, it has one of those themes that I can't get out of my head and a score I've been listening to since I left the theater. The film itself was a very interesting film, very different from what I understood from the trailer, but I'm not familiar with the story so that is probably the main reason. I really liked the futuristic, post-apocalyptic, dystopian feel that it had going on through it, but it also was kind of scary to think that human life could become that one day. The plot was easy enough to follow, but sometimes confusing. Though, if I had read the book, I'm sure I would understand it 100%. The elements I had trouble remembering were the names of all the factions that people were divided in, or chose to be in, and what those factions' meanings were. When they would show the symbols for each faction, it made sense to me, but the names itself I couldn't quite grasp. I'm sure a second viewing will clear that up, defiantly if that second viewing is on blu-ray and with the captions on. Anyway, other than that, It kept me quite intrigued in a pleasantly unexpected way and I really look forward to next year for the sequel, Insurgent, and the year after that for the concluding film, Allegiant.","

"Divergent","viliporkola","8 June 2023","Yah, like said on title, this movie was cool, action scenes worked, story world was innovative, the clothing, factions, utopian way how people behaved, whole concept was interesting.. UNTIL it fell flat on the writing and/or directing.Was really into the movie at the start, very intriqued, but sloowly it started to turn into an already seen type of imaginary sci-fi movie with a mix of American teenagers TV-series drama and love. Just annoying. Should had been strictly kept as how it was in the beginning, SERIOUS. (Like star-trek!)Story world like this requires an serious execution, no lala-land love stories!","

"Divergent","bilburry","14 April 2022","I've seen a lot of people criticizing the movie for being a rip off of Hunger Games but I feel the two series are very different from each other. Apart from being dystopian there are very little similarities between the two.Personally, I liked the movie. It was well-made with good character development.","

"Divergent","zardoz-13","24 March 2014","The immaculate cinematic adaptation of Veronica Roth's futuristic bestseller ""Divergent,"" set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, is neither as gripping nor as gritty as its literary counterpart. I read the first installment of Ms. Roth's trilogy two weeks ago, and adventurous but formulaic best describes its narrative. Interestingly, Summit Entertainment is the same Hollywood studio that regaled us with the ""Twilight"" franchise as well as the ""The Hunger Games"" movies. Based on the $56-million ""Divergent"" coined over its first weekend, Summit has launched its third lucrative franchise. By its second week of release, ""Divergent"" should recoup the remainder of its $85 million production costs before the ""Captain America"" sequel stomps it into obscurity at the box office. Comparably, ""Divergent"" lacks the taboo romance of ""Twilight"" and the pugnacious pluck of ""The Hunger Games."" Happily, it surpasses its closest competitors—the colorless ""Vampire Academy"" and ""Twilight"" novelist Stephanie Meyer's other dead-on-arrival tale ""The Host"" that toplined a similarly feisty female. Chiefly, ""Divergent"" differs because its' government lacks the Draconian nature of its counterpart in ""The Hunger Games."" The fascist government that keeps its boot wedged firmly against the collective neck of Katniss Everdeen, her friends and family in ""The Hunger Games"" is conspicuously absent in ""Divergent."" Our heroine, Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley of ""The Descendants"") isn't like Katniss, and she doesn't define herself with an iconic choice of weapons so much as a lifestyle pursuit. Ultimately, like ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Star Wars,"" Beatrice finds herself cornered in a flawed society that treacherous evildoers want to sabotage through any means at hand. Consequently, ""Divergent"" doesn't have the built-in, ticking time bomb conflict that ""The Hunger Games"" has with a rebellion. Indeed, this predicament isn't far ahead, but at least not in this origins opus. ""Divergent"" incredibly surprising, but its 140 running time won't wear you out.""Limitless"" director Neil Burger and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" writer Evan Daugherty and ""Game of Thrones"" scribe Vanessa Taylor depict a dystopian society that has split itself into factions to prevent any one fraction from gaining the upper hand. Indeed, the unrest that lurks ominously in ""Divergent"" grows out of a conspiracy between wicked members of two fractions. The message, I suppose, is old people aren't entirely trustworthy. Meanwhile, ""Divergent"" opens with a gathering where teenagers can declare the fraction of their choice. At age sixteen, male and females assemble for The Choosing Ceremony. Basically, after a war that ended 100 years ago, the survivors divided themselves into a handful of groups: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. Each group is based on a personality virtue. Abnegation consists of selfless people who place the needs of others before their own. They feed the poor wretches who are not members of a fraction. Amity represents the peaceful people. Candor is made up of those who exalt honesty and truth. Erudite worships intelligence and sagacity. Not surprisingly, Dauntless embraces bravery and reckless impetuosity. Our wallflower protagonist Beatrice hails from a selfless Abnegation family. Abnegates dress in gray and are contemptuously denigrated as 'stiffs.' Andrew (Tony Goldwyn of ""Ghost"") and Natalie (Ashley Judd of ""Kiss the Girls"") are Beatrice's parents. Caleb (Ansel Elgort of ""Carrie"") is Beatrice's brother. Before The Choosing Ceremony, each teen submits to an aptitude test. The results indicate the suitable fraction for them to join. Dauntless member Tori (Maggie Q of the TV series ""Nikita"") exams Beatrice. The rules dictate the test administrator must belong to a different fraction from the one the tested teen comes from. Something goes wrong with Beatrice's test. ""You're different. You don't fit into a category,"" Tori confides in her. "" They can't control you. They call it Divergent. You can't let them find out about you."" Testing divergent is the worst thing that can happen to a teen in this society. No fraction will accept them if the divergent test results are made known. A sympathetic Tori warns Beatrice to conceal her status from everybody, including her parents. Nevertheless, this impediment doesn't stop Beatrice from surprising her mother and father. She joins the Dauntless. She struggles to keep up with these adrenaline junkies. They love to scale the elevate railway platforms and scramble aboard trains as the trains are breezing out of the station. Getting off these trains proves to be even more challenging! The Dauntless expects them to leap off the trains and land on nearby rooftops. Eventually, Beatrice renames herself Tris and braves perils galore during her initiation ritual, including a homicide attempt on her life. Gradually, she evolves from a lowly worm to a self-propelled butterfly with a kick. Along the way, she attracts the eye of one of her superiors, Four (Theo James of ""Underworld: Awakening""), and an amorous relationship develops between the two.Anybody who has read Roth's novel shouldn't be surprised by the textual omissions Burger and his scenarists have deleted some of the more violent scenes. The use of chemicals to test Dauntless faction members, especially with regard to their fears, resembles the missions in ""The Matrix."" Like ""The Matrix,"" ""Divergent"" wrestles with the theme of conformity. Our tenacious heroine learns how to handle herself during boot camp combat. As the finale appears on her horizon, Tris knows more about those she loved that she didn't know. She finds more strength in herself than she thought impossible, too. She enters the Dauntless world as an expendable but emerges triumphant. The scene on the Ferris wheel is cool. Casting is letter perfect. Actress Shailene Woodley was born to play Beatrice. She looks comfortable in the role. Although co-star Theo James appears a little too old as her boyfriend Four, the two generate chemistry and that makes us care about them. ""Titanic's"" Kate Winslet plays the chief villain, and Jai Courtney of ""Live Free: is appropriately sinister as Eric, who ranks above Four in the Dauntless hierarchy. Nothing about ""Divergent"" is remotely offensive, but its strong cast maintains our attention as does its futuristic designs.","

"Divergent","marc5477","27 July 2014","Here are the pivotal problems from my memory after barely watching it once (while playing on my phone): (warning some of these are spoilers)1) When Tris gets the flag it was because the guard was not guarding the only grate leading up to that position. Not science but retarded none the less. Further how the hell did that guard use all her bullets when Tris was the 1st person up the tower? Whatever.2) Three men couldn't push a 100lb girl over a ledge. Whatever. When she is rescued by her boytoy, he didn't bother removing their masks to see who they are when he had all day to do it while they were down.3) Brains can be wiped and reprogrammed with chemicals. No that's not how brain physiology works. If you wipe completely then you would be a vegetable because the only way to do so is to destroy pathways that form action, intent and memory. You cannot wipe a mind by chemical means without wiping it entirely. It might be doable with nano machines but this particular future does not even have guided weapons. Nano tech is beyond their ability. Hell their scientists are actually emotional pansy politicians. Retarded.4) Apparently ""divergence"" is the only way one can be a threat to society. Yea right. Apparently with all the collective knowledge of the science group, this is the conclusion they came up. They actually believe that the most deviant of society are the ones with the greatest intelligence and potential not those with low self esteem, low intelligence, and shallow personalities. But that is too much for them to figure out I guess. Some scientists they are... and you expect them to have nanotech? Its like expect al kaida to invent the 1st sentient AI lol.5) The ending was not as dramatic as the movie made it out to be. Finding a vial on the floor with an applicator is not quick thinking, its obvious and embarrassing (that she and her boy toy didn't figure it out sooner).6) The romance innuendo was unbelievable. Its worse than a Mexican soap. There was no reason whatsoever for that guy to be so overwhelmingly interested in her and willing to risk everything for her. Its like a bad high school drama.7) Actions scenes were worse than comedy action scenes. Bullets seem to go around the main character like a cartoon. Also no one seems to remember how to shoot when engages against her. Also she miraculously becomes an expert shot after being the worst shot during training. They should have just given her throwing knives and have her fly across roof tops like kung fu movies.Retarded movie for low IQ teens.","

"Divergent","ThomasDrufke","21 March 2014","There's a lot to like and there's also a lot to shake your head with this film. For one, it shouldn't be over 2 hours. Its near 140 minutes but a good chunk is spent just watching the same training over and over again. Shailene Woodley was good in the movie, and I also found that I like her love interest Theo James. I thought his character was much more interesting than Peeta and Gail in the Hunger Games Movies. With that said, I know a lot of people really loved this movie, and I respect that. But I just wasn't thrilled with how it played out.Before the negatives there are a few positives that made the film at least an enjoyable watch in theaters. I really thought all the actors fit their role, and I thought each character was written very well. Except for the parents but ill get to that later. Each of Tris' friends once she picks her group were fun. And even the twist with a few of the characters later were interesting and kept me guessing. Miles Teller was funny and delivered a few lines that I got a good chuckle out of. I think its funny how Woodley already has a film with Teller as her love interest and a movie with Caleb (Tris' Brother) as her love interest. The ending turned out to be better than the other 3/4 of the movie.Now onto the negatives, some actors were completely underused in this movie. Kate Winslet (who I expected to have a menacing presence) may have had close to 15 lines in the entire film. Also the parents were given little screen time, and were then just killed off right after each other. The scene with the mom dying was a little emotional sure but I didn't feel connected to these characters due to the few lines and how they randomly show up. The dad's death was poorly handled as well. The music in this movie never seemed to fit. The score that you rarely here was decent (Hans Zimmer). But really all the songs used seemed out of place. I'm never a big fan of any songs that appear in films, much rather stick to the scores. A few scenes the CGI is unbelievably noticeable which shouldn't happen with a big budget film like this one. There were also several CHEESY parts, including a few romance scenes that made me cringe at how awkward they made us feel.Not reading the book, I kinda felt like I was left with several unanswered questions, but perhaps the sequel will address them. I really hope Allegiant is better, and the change of director may help considering Catching Fire was substantially better than the original Hunger Games and they had a change of director. We shall see, but Overall it can be enjoyable with interesting characters and some cool ideas but disappointed with the final product. 6.7/10","

"Divergent","redcarpetrefs","19 March 2014","Divergent is a film adaptation of the novel, written by veronica Roth, that takes place in dystopian Chicago. The society that resides there is split into five groups or ""factions"", each representing different virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, Erudite. On a certain day each year, all youth that are 16 years old take test that determined which faction is the best fit. In the end, no matter what the result, one is free to choose whatever faction they wish to. However, if that faction is different from the one they were raised in, they must leave their families and everything else behind and fully commit to their new role in society.Tris (Shailene Woodley) is one of these 16 year olds to be divided. On testing day she shows equal aptitude for three separate factions, making her ""Divergent"". Confused, Tris is told to keep her results a secret and ends up choosing the Dauntless faction. As Tris deals with the grueling challenges of becoming Dauntless, she discovers that being divergent entails much more than she ever imagined.I think fans of the book will be very pleased with the adaptation. I have not read the books so I made sure to bring a friend, who had, to the screening with me. According to her, the film does a great job at making the book an emotional and entertaining movie without sacrificing major plot points that would otherwise leave fans disappointed. The Tris and Four (Theo James) are well cast. There's nothing particularly outstanding but they are enjoyable to watch. According to my well-read friend, their romance was whittled down significantly for the film, which I think worked out for the better. I really enjoyed how their relationship developed. And while it is a major part, it didn't overshadow the story as a whole.I was really impressed with the music. Being a dance music fan, I think the soundtrack is fun. But the musical score, composed by Junkie XL, is what stood out to me most. There are a handful of very emotional scenes and the music really drives it home.I am a little outside the target age range for this movie but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The obstacles that Tris encounters will translate to audiences of all ages. It's a great story with multiple scenes that led me to reflect on not only my own adolescence but also on my journey as an adult. Out of all young-adult-dystopian novels that have been made into movies, this one is definitely my fave.http://redcarpetrefs.com/2014/03/divergent-review/","

"Divergent","aharmas","21 March 2014","I've decided to go back and give ""Divergent"" a second opportunity so I could appreciate all the great things I had heard about it, its story, action, acting, and how it worked so well that we could expect sequels to let us partake of more of this trio of novels by Roth.After sitting through more than two hours of something that supposedly happens in the not so far future, a dystopian society where the government has decided to divide into four sections, which depend on the citizens' qualities, and because now there's harmony and everything runs smoothly, peace has been achieved, or so we are made to believe.To be fair, there are good things in the movie, and because they are pretty good, it's only appropriate to give credit where it is due. Ms Kate Winslett once again proves to the world the lady can handle just about any acting job you give her. In ""Divergent"" she's the leader of one of the sections, and she looks and acts the part. In fact, she's so convinced she's so perfect for her job, she takes on the job of improving what's already a perfect society, and every time, balance is off, someone is going to suffer. Winslett is cold, efficient, imposing, and pretty good in her ""Divergent"" persona. She's already played aristocrats (""Titanic""), interestingly, she's also given us a chance to witness her talents as a member of the lower classes, too, when she throws caution to the wind and joins Jack in the same film. Even better, she's proved that she can survive in a world where a totalitarian leader takes over, without questioning anything about it (""The Reader""). Here she's nothing else than a very smart and sophisticated cold mass assassin, and she gives us a performance to relish, a performance that shines and stands over the rest because there's very little else in this film to call worthy.And yet, there is Ashley Judd, badly cast as the rebel mother who surprises us with her stealthy moves, as a survival soldier who sacrifices her stability to save her family. She tries really hard with that steely core of hers to give her character substance, but the role is so ludicrous and poorly written that I couldn't help laughing instead of feeling devastated in her big scene. I remembered how much I have loved in much better material.Now, on to ""Divergent""... The material suffers from the lack of originality. We've seen this before in much better guise in more entertaining films, and sadly, the other trio of books and films have come out not long ago. The setting is the future, the masses have been oppressed, and the revolutions have started... Does that sound familiar? In addition to that a few other authors must be wondering why other people just borrow without even trying to hide the fact. At least in the case of Potter, the references were elegant, more of a good tribute, and having those phrases in Latin or something like that, makes the whole experience more palatable. It doesn't hurt that the characters are indeed much better written. One certainly wishes there was more magic in ""Divergent"".In addition to the fact that we are dealing with an unoriginal and paradoxically slow action film, full of noise, a loud and disturbing score that doesn't support but impedes our enjoyment of the muddy photography and the very interesting editing techniques, we have two leads that have absolutely no chemistry and a leading character that seems to believe that strength equals a vacant look. There's no transformation from whatever it is supposed to be at first, insecurity, indecision, confusion, to the hardened, both physically and psychologically scarred heroine. It's problematic because the entire premise rests on this transformation, and as pretty as the lead is, there's definitely not much of a heroic soul here. Anyone can hold an automatic gun and pretend they are a good shoot, but we have no Daniel Craig, Jennifer Lawrence, Scarlett Johansson, or anyone involved in the Marvel Universe here. They're both fictional, too, and much better written, performed and realized.I was having a bit of a problem with the setting of the story. Instead of leading through an hour of training sessions and escapades, and a very confusing testing session, I was hoping that someone would explain that train. Why does it keep running? What's going on with the way this society allows the people that don't to wander around? Why are some places to high tech, looking so futuristic, but we have other residences that could pass for Amish in the way they are portrayed? Someone wasn't really doing much to create a believable universe.I couldn't help comparing this film with another one where people engage in the deception of the masses through entertainment but have to become resourceful in order to survive, and there are flashes of social instability that eventually germinate into chaos and revolution. It does help that there is a more solid script and a main character that shows her flaws, her troubles, her growth, and her steel core with her acting, instead of a narration that well, helps get me confused and distracted me to the point I thought I was narcoleptic. Enter at your own risk. If you see this, you might not need that mind controlling serum after all.","

"Divergent","jpachar82","22 March 2014","The United States of America is not what we once knew – the nation was split and the government was run out by factions – 5 to be exact: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite. With everyone in these factions it was going to be a peaceful world until one day one girl, one test result can change the way our minds can change who we are – Divergent! One faction the Erudite comes in and destroys the peaceful nation by catapulting a ruthless attempt to rid the world of Divergents and the overrule the government so they can get their way with the leadership of one woman – Jeanine Matthews (played beautifully by Kate Winslet.) I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for the people who have not seen the movie but I will say this – this movie was lacking in some places where things were left unsaid, action was left out and things were changed up a bit.This movie was an awesome way of letting dive into a young writers mind of how she sees the world, Veronica Roth who at the time was 23 when she wrote this book. The book was action packed and so was the movie, matter of fact the movie was incredible. The cast ranging from Shailene Woodley to Theo James to the wonderful Ashley Judd and Zoe Kravitz (yes that is Lenny's daughter!) to the villainous Kate Winslet.But the question remains is: Which faction will you choose? Let's hope Insurgent delivers.","

"Divergent","peterp-450-298716","7 August 2014","˝The future belongs to those who know where they belong.˝ ˝Divergent¨.A movie everyone was eagerly looking forward to. A movie a lot of fuss was made about. A movie that was doomed to be a mega-success in the cinemas as ˝Guardians of the Galaxy˝. The only difference with the latter is that the film from Marvel really looks original and refreshing and also has an unique atmosphere. ˝Divergent ˝ is yet another adaptation of a youth book, written by the twenty-five-year-old Veronica Roth, of which one hopes it will make a heap of money just like ˝Twilight˝ and ˝The Hunger Games˝ did. And after wards the merchandising could exploit the youthful fans for years. Admittedly, I had a good feeling about this movie and was wondering how this film would turn out. That good feeling melted away like snow in the sun after roughly 45 minutes. I came to the conclusion that it was just another teen movie, with the same stale story lines and banal trivialities that would make an impression on a young naive public. In other words, again a fragile individual that eventually grows into a heroine and, surprisingly, saves society from being ruined. Sigh. That's indeed for once quite different and terribly innovative.As I mentioned earlier, the first 45 minutes were fascinating. An explanation about the current situation with magnificent images of the ruins of Chicago. I was just wondering why they didn't renovate the existing buildings, since they could construct those ultra modern glass and iron buildings. Or were these half-streaked tower blocks the shelter for those who didn't belong to any class? Whatever. The description of the various factions was pictured nicely. It even went into a socio-political direction at one moment. But soon I couldn't prevent seeing comparison points with the other movies of youth books.However, I fear to say everything that's been said before and I don't think I will reveal any new original angles. Indeed, the system of factions reasonable compares to that in ˝The Hunger Games˝. Katniss became a symbol of liberation and hope in ˝The Hunger Games˝. I suppose that role will also be played by Beatrice (I could be hopelessly wrong since I've never read the books). The ceremony can be compared with that from Harry Potter. The only thing they do not need to do is to put that old talking hat on their head. Just as Melanie, a rebellious teenager, in ˝The Host˝, Beatrice gets hopelessly entangled in a puppy love affair, as expected. Nevertheless there is one positive point. It's by far better than ˝Beautiful Creatures˝ and way better than ˝The Mortar Instruments˝. And if you want to look at a futuristic film, where there is a distinction between certain classes and also has a struggle for freedom, then I suggest you watch ˝Snowpiercer˝. But then however, this movie lacks a bit of real romance and the aggressive and violent level is a bit higher. So it's not for the faint romantic souls.The initial phase where Tris is heading out with the jeering mob of Dauntless, climbing and balancing on bridges while wandering through town and jumping on hurtling trains and after wards jumping back on flat roofs (yes just getting on and off a train at a platform is not challenging for these daredevils) is still enjoyable. Even the tests that they have to endure and the mutual competition that arises is still acceptable. But in the end I thought it was a barbaric and cruel faction that throw out newbies, who ultimately have chosen for them, because they didn't pass the tests. The moment a slight chemistry develops between Four and Tris, it goes downhill for me and it becomes a little too predictable. The ˝Beverly Hills 90210˝ level was reached without any problem with the glitzy, handsome protagonists and feel-good moments. It won't be long and the merchandising machine will be on track and we are bombarded with all sorts of trinkets and gadgets. The next years will once again be filled with Barbie-like stuff, TV programs, PC Games and fashion statements that are related to ˝Divergent¨.Shailene Woodley is perfect for this role and exudes a charisma and fragility. Her ​​future as a teen idol is guaranteed. She will travel the trajectory as a rising star just like Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson did before her. We'll just wait and see if her future performances will be appreciated by moviegoers. Theo James has his looks and that will also guarantee a high melting level for all the the teenage girls looking at him and who will be floating home after wards. His toughness doesn't last long and before you know it he protects Tris as a real mother hen and winds up on the soggy and corny romantic path. Of all the companions of Tris the only one that I can remember is the role of Miles Teller as the terrible enervating Peter. When I look at his performance in ˝The Awkward Moment˝ I'm sure that the irritating quality is a personal trait. Kate Winslet managed again to come across as haughty and disdainful. For the rest it wasn't really an impressive role.Ultimately ˝Divergent˝ is an adolescent story with a disappointing predictable plot. I suppose the sequel, like with ˝The Hunger Games˝, will be a middle film which will contribute even less. So I'm not going to bother to watch it. Despite the sometimes extremely professional elaborate action scenes, it all feels as fake as the applied tattoos.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be","

"Divergent","IrishFrog","22 January 2016","Now here's the thing: I've read the book, which means I started the movie knowing what to expect. So the cheesy plot, the seemingly nonexistent background, everything was already inherent to Divergent in my mind. To me, it was simply part of the concept that the movie would develop, so I didn't find it so horrible. In fact, I even thought it was a good adaptation of the book, but then that could have been because I read it over a year (or maybe even a couple of years) ago. I can't say it was objectively good, though.The romance was awful, there seemed to be no chemistry between the characters in question, they definitely would have been better off as friends. Time seemed to be off too. I mean, I knew quite some time was supposed to have passed between (SPOILER)the choosing ceremony and the final confrontation(/SPOILER), but the director didn't seem to be able to convey the passage of time properly, so hadn't I read the book, I think I'd probably have a sense of timelessness and would see it all as a bunch of things that happened somewhere at some point with some unknown amount of time separating them. Not only weren't characters really unique or remarkable, but also the film lacked emotion and thrill. Most scenes that could have been intense seemed to be left unexplored in detriment of more fight scenes and, seeing as I'm not really a fan of action (or romance, for that matter), I didn't care much about all that violence. Despite all that, I did enjoy myself while watching it. I don't know why. Maybe seeing images I'd only had in my mind be put into something real and concrete made it special to me, maybe I already knew how bad it could be, so whatever good thing came of it was surprising enough... In the end, I'd say this is a movie for you to watch when you don't have much to do and you just want to relax.","

"Divergent","captaincameron","22 March 2014","I always click ""may contain spoilers"" in case I slip, but I try not to offer any. And as i write this review, I should admit that I never got around to finishing the book, so I can't say how true the film was to it. But I can say how true the film was to, well, films in general, and that was this: average. The pacing was poorly assembled. How the world came to be the way that it was was never explained. Why Kate Winslett was in the movie was unfathomable. This may be a spoiler, so stop reading if you wish to avoid such, but when our heroine and others are being trained in hand-to-hand combat, they adopt some sort of weird ""I'm hugging a skinny person to my chest"" stance with their hands and keep their legs almost entirely straight. This is guaranteed to have them get the crap kicked out of them. But the good points: the characters were consistent all the way through. Good point, I guess that was. My advice: Wait for this one to hit the premium channels. More advice: While Divergent was the first in a trilogy, and Hollywood has a way of making a trilogy into four or five or seven movies, don't expect a sequel. This really was that sort of weak.","

Climax music for a random walking scene, with nothing Epic going on? Check. A police force faction who acted like complete a**holes for no reason? Check. They would run everywhere for no apparent reason, act loud and make noise for no reason. Ohh here is the best part, they would climb up to the overhead subway, again for no reason, and the train would not stop at stops, it would keep going so they needed to jump into it. Wait it gets better, they end up in their headquarters where it looks worst than a run down prison, then next scene they decided to get tattoos, and they are in a swanky upscale lounge with everyone's hair done.

"Divergent","PassPopcorn","31 March 2014","Divergent is yet another bestselling novel I've never heard about, and part of yet another young adult trilogy, by yet another female writer (Veronica Roth) I've, again, never heard about. Also, this is yet another movie I would never have watched, had I not had to write this blog – basically because it looks awful, boring and unoriginal. Before I turn this into a rant against this newest fashion everyone seems to be crazy about, I'll talk about the movie. Divergent is probably best summed up in an anecdote: while trying to point out the difference between The Hunger Games and Divergent, the latter's director Neil Burger started explaining what it was about – and his explanation could have easily been applied to both movies. Ironically, Divergent hails individuality while being a copycat itself.Divergent is set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, where people are divided in five factions, depending on their virtues: the Erudite are smart, the Amity are kind, the Candor honest, the Dauntless brave and the Abnegation selfless. Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) and her family are Abnegation, but she and her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) have to take the aptitude test to determine which faction they truly belong to. Beatrice's results are inconclusive, she's dubbed Divergent and must keep this secret. Eventually, she chooses the Dauntless faction and starts a difficult training after which the weakest ones will be cast out and become factionless – all the while, hiding her true, Divergent nature, as Divergents are being hunt down and killed.Surprisingly, Divergent didn't turn out to be as bad as I thought it would be. It might be because the director is Neil Burger, who also directed Limitless and The Illusionist, which are good movies. Also, the acting isn't bad, although, sometimes, somewhat underwhelming. This applies especially to Kate Winslet, who plays the 'bad girl' in the movie, the Erudite Jeanine – and the fact that she's bad is evident from the first moment she's on screen, just because she's cold and falsely kind. Her character isn't developed any further, she remains irritatingly perfect, as if that was enough to make a good villain. But in this case, the problem is mostly of the screenwriters – and probably the novelist, who created the interesting setting and faction system, but didn't exploit their potential fully or elaborate them enough to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies.As I mentioned before, the movie reminds much of The Hunger Games, but I don't see that as the movie's (or the book's) bad quality. What surprises me is that, after all those silly young adult flicks we've had and still have, people and mostly teenagers are, once again, interested in the same old story – just check out Divergent's box office results. The market is saturated and it's extremely difficult to create a new YA series that will be truly good anymore. Divergent (the movie, but I doubt the book is better, at least story-wise) isn't good: it's predictable, filled with clichés, boring, too long, unoriginal and so on. And still, the book came out and it was a success, and the movie came out and was a success, too – and this will most likely happen to all the other similar novels and movies that will be published in the future. I can only say, if you want to get rich fast, just write a teen love story, with a wannabe social commentary, not set on out planet and/or in our time, and you're guaranteed to succeed.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/","

"Divergent","SnoopyStyle","4 February 2015","In future Chicago, the inhabitants have fenced off the city and split society into five factions. Abnegation is selfless and put in charge of the government. Amity is the cheerfully peaceful farm workers. Candor is honest. Dauntless is the wild brave protector. Erudite is the intelligent scientists. Those who don't belong are forced to live as Factionless. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives as an Abnegation with her family. She is about to choose her lifelong Fraction in the Choosing Ceremony. Tori (Maggie Q) gives her a test and tells her that she's Divergent meaning she has more than one element in her. It's something that must be hidden. She switches Fraction to Dauntless and trained by Four (Theo James). There is a dark scheme underway by Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet).The phrase that keeps coming to my mind is ""I don't buy this world."" Every revelation led me to question the origins of this world. This future world seems weakly drawn. I also don't buy the motivations of Dauntless leadership. I like some of the characters and willing to buy their stories. It's not the best of the young adult friction but it works enough to continue.","

What did they spend $85 million on? There's no special effects whatsoever unless you consider a computer generated landscape of a futuristic Chicago a special effect. The acting is weak. The two main characters are completely miscast for a romance, it's borderline pedophilic. The filmwork feels like it was shot on a vid-cam. I would have walked out about three quarters of the way thru but didn't want to disturb the others in the theater so I just sat there yawning and rolling my eyes. What a stupid movie. I guess with this type of trash appealing to the Twilight slash Hunger Games crowd I should say, Oh mah gawd gag mah with a spoon.","

"Divergent","eddie052010","15 April 2014","Over the past few years, the young adult novel adaptation has become a popular as shown with the box office success of franchises like Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hunger Games. However, despite the million dollar success of the aforementioned franchises, other attempts to create big franchises based on young adult novels, more often than not fall flat on their faces. This is due to either the fact that they aren't unique enough to stand out (and therefore doesn't get the box office popularity it needs to start a franchise) or are flat out rubbish. This is more of the former. While there is some bright sparks that suggest this franchise has more to offer in future installments, the first part is far too safe, predictable and formulaic to justify it's stance as a film that will lead on to a more interesting franchise.The plot of the film is that Beatrice Prior is living in a future-set dystopian Chicago, which is divided into five factions which are based on the various personalities of the people who live there. These are Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (truthful), Erudite (intelligent) and Dauntless (brave). Beatrice Prior, however, is a divergent, a group who are hunted down by the government in order to maintain the peace. In order to hide this, she joins Dauntless, a more militant faction under strict rule. Will she be able to cope by belonging to a single group or will she reveal her divergence.The plot is one of the film's more obvious flaws, seeing as it steals many of its major plot threads from another source. The faction system brings to mind The Hunger Games, but while watching the film you'll start to notice that the film seems to owe more to Philip K. Dick, with much of technology used in the film and the way that the mind is a running theme, seems to have come out from one of his stories. This isn't a huge gripe, seeing as how it is slightly more subtle about it's theft than other franchise starters (Constantine and The Hunger games for instance), but for a film called Divergent, it doesn't seem to be unique enough to truly stand out in order to interest audiences not familiar with the source material.That highlights the major flaw with this movie as a whole: it's far too bland and safe. It's a setup movie at it's worst, something that gladly sets up (some of) the world and characters but is lacking in confidence to truly spread it's wings and soar. The world isn't shown in high detail, the villains here are clearly pawns for a bigger power and on top of this, throughout the majority of the running time, nothing hugely important seems to happen. Sure we find out that the girl here is a divergent and a few major events in her life happen here and there, but for the most part, the movie consists of training segments and montages. Not very exciting stuff is it?It definitely isn't exciting, considering when the action consists of shaky cam, fast editing and close-ups, that ruin the action than make it more intense. It isn't just during the action though, as there are many parts which use gimmicky camera tricks in order to make the movie cooler than it actually is. Casein point, there is a dream section where the camera circles the characters, which could potentially make you feel nauseous.However, there are some good things, that gives this franchise some hope of improving. The acting for the most part is good, even if the main lead is bland, and Kate Winslet is wasted as the villain. The world definitely looks interesting, and the money ($85 million) is clearly on the screen. On top of this, excluding action and certain scenes, the direction is good, and proves that he is great at dramatic set pieces. Despite all of this, the film is clearly lacking in many areas to justify itself as the next big sci-fi franchise.Overall, despite a few high points here and there, the film lacks any punch. Even though things could improve in future entries, the film itself isn't divergent enough (pardon the pun) to stand out and have any staying power as a result.","

The film comes across as a bad TV movie but overlong and is no doubt trying to cash in on hunger games.The plot is dreadful and has more holes that the albert hall, and those silly guns make NERF guns seem lethal. Also Why or why in all bad SF films do characters wear these one piece baby suits with a large belt. Surely in the future they will have more to base their fashion on than Star trek generations!","

"Divergent","grantss","18 April 2015","Inception meets Brave New World, but dumbed down for kids. You could also throw in a few other dystopian/post-apocalyptic movies and books that this is derivative of (not that Inception is such a movie, but the dreams-within-dreams scenes in Divergent reminded me of that).So, derive a plot from these books/movies, then dumb it down for kids. Hero(ine) is a teen. The good guys are the running, jumping, climbing, fighting types, not the intellectuals, or anyone else. (The perpetual running, jumping and climbing actually made the Dauntless people quite comical, rather than heroic, to me. Their whole shtick just seemed so lame). Throw in the usual underdog prevails against the odds and ultimately becomes a hero routine, with a bit of romance and an evil conspiracy by the adults/non-action types and you have your common-or-garden teen action movie. Only positive thing I can say about this is that at least it was better than The Hunger Games (but only marginally so). At least Divergent had some semblance of grit and edginess - Hunger Games is a like a Disney action-movie.","

"Divergent","trepessa","25 December 2014","When I sat down to watch this movie I wasn't sure at first if I would like it but I actually did. I'm not fond of dystopian civilization movies but this one was very good once there was momentum to the storyline. This is a trilogy so the first movie is setting it up for the other two movies or four if they divide the last book into two parts, which has become the standard for a series of books. People need to do a little research before going to see a movie like this. The book was published by Harper/Collins Children's Books, knowing that the novel is geared either for children or young adults. In this case, it was for young adults and that doesn't mean it is to attract fourteen year old teens. People keep bringing up Twilight and this isn't the same type of science fiction story at all. The other is more towards horror and this is not. Besides Twilight was wildly popular and with people of all ages. Those that didn't like the series are in the minority. My daughter was a manager at a movie theater when they were all released and they filled several at each opening and it wasn't all teens.Divergent is a futuristic society that is after some cataclysm which can be natural or a war and in this case it was a war. People ended up divided by nature but some didn't fit into one category and this threatens this particular society. They kept the story in one city and how they resolved what happened to them and not all over the world. The cast was excellent and I saw no problem with the acting. There will be similarities with other stories of this type if they are based on a dystopian society. This one is nothing like the Hunger Games whatsoever. It follows its own storyline which is quite different but after a great cataclysm how the society was functioning. Don't go if you can't deal with the main actors being young. There were many adults in the movie with major parts and covered by very well known actors. This movie was about going through a test and getting placed in a segment of their society although you were free to choose regardless of the results of the test and once chosen that was it for life.I enjoyed this movie and I'm a senior. I don't think there is any age preference to watching movies. The subject matter was very serious and very adult oriented. I await the next segment which if as good will have me watching until the last movie as I did Twilight and Harry Potter. This movie did very well at the box office and the reviews are mixed by professional critics. I am not paying much attention to reviews here who are not professional, because most of them are predictable because this side of science fiction is either you hate it or you love it generally speaking and I didn't love it but I thought it was a good movie and very creative. Even though I have seen dystopian movies in the past this one was inventive on many levels. If you know you don't like this type of movie don't do reviews and compare to every other movie with a young cast. The age of the cast isn't relevant it is the reason for them that is relevant, the place they fill in the society being represented. The movie shows how one got placed into the various societal groups when you reached the appropriate age and what they went through in a few of them by the choices they made. It was rigid and the movie showed how it was falling apart because there was no room for change and growth and rivalries began to form. It's violent like other movies of this type, so be prepared for a less than homey atmosphere in the future society created in this story.","

The writing was poor, inconsistent and very basic it could not compete with other action superhero's movies released in the last couple of years. I gave a 6 because i find the directing and the cast were good, they made the movie stand out. I found Theo one of the best parts in the movie.. I mean lets be honest, they had to choose a good looking actor and make his this perfect to attract audience.","

I have never read the books but going into this film without reading them I didn't know if I would like it. But I was wrong. This movie was Very Good! I love the character of Beatrice, I think she is a great role model for the youth of today which is the main problem with some of these teen flicks today which have very thin leading roles. What surprised me also, is that I recognized the actress who played her. She was the daughter from The Descendants. A very big step up from such a small film.There is also some social commentary in this film. It talks about the effects of living in a world where people have to be the same or else they are thrown onto the streets. Very clever for a teen film.It is very worthy of the IMAX treatment, its a big and bold film that I think is going to be the next best thing in a long time. I don't care if there are missing stuff from the book, this movie was super good! Divergent is a must see for Teens, Parents, and Adults who are wanting to watch some great entertainment.78/100 B","

The faction day thing seemed interesting, but it dragged on a bit. There's something so boring and bland about the setting and the look to this film. It's just off putting.The characters' are so boring it's ridiculous. It makes it hard to cope with the plot if you cant connect with the characters (robots) themselves. The end of the movie is rushed. Everything seems so idiotic and it's like ""HEY LOOK NOW WE'RE SUDDENLY ANGRY AND WE WANT TO KILL THE GOVERNMENT ARRGGHHHH!"" Stupid.Time to turn my Hunger Games bias button back on. Divergent sucks. Compared to The Hunger Games, it's cow dung. It's foul. Boring Bland. Boring. Bland. And a little bit boring.And here's something ridiculous:Even the behind-the-scenes are boring! WOW! IT'S ALL SO BORING!I really can't explain anything about this movie. The characters are robots. It's boring. No emotions. Oh wait, then they gotta boost up the film to make it seem sophisticated by killing her parents and sh!t.The only part I liked was the bird scene during her dream or something. But of course, the only reason I like it is because it is the scene from The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. They completely copied it.Anyone who is part of this movie fandom is crazy. It is terrible!

"Divergent","Hellmant","24 March 2014","'DIVERGENT': Five Stars (Out of Five)Big budget adaptation of the popular youth book about a future world where society is divided into different factions based on people's beliefs and ethics. The hero of the story is a young woman who doesn't fit into any category, so she's labeled a 'divergent', which makes her a threat to government and the accepted conformist way of life. It stars Shailene Woodley as the divergent heroine and co-stars Theo James, Kate Winslet, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Miles Teller, Zoë Kravitz, Tony Goldwyn and Maggie Q. It was directed by Neil Burger and written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor (based on the book by Veronica Roth). I enjoyed it quite a bit and found it to be one of the better youth book film adaptations ever made.The story is set sometime in the future, after a war which divides the remaining civilization into five different factions (that are supposed to represent a person's skills and virtues). There's amity (which are the people who are the most peaceful), abnegation (made up of the selfless), candor (the most honest), erudite (the most intelligent) and dauntless (the world's most brave and fearless). There comes a time when teenagers must make a choice to either stay in the faction they were raised in or pick another. First they take a test which tells them which faction they belong in. Beatrice Prior, who later goes by Tris (Woodley), fails the test and is known by what society calls 'divergent' (due to the fact that she doesn't belong in any faction). Divergent people are seen as a threat to society, since they don't conform, and are killed because of it. Tris joins dauntless and must survive a rigorous testing process, in order to be accepted there, while also keeping her divergent status a secret. At the same time she learns there's a plot by one faction to overthrow another.I really like the setup to this sci-fi tale; it's interesting, complex and very entertaining at the same time. Burger (who won't return for the two planned sequels) and the screenwriters did a great job of bringing this world to life on screen. It's intense and very emotional at times. One of my favorite parts of the film is the performances; I think Woodley is an amazing talent to watch out for and is very impressive as the lead here. Usually the male actors suck in these youth book adaptation flicks but the guys cast in this are actually able to hold their own with the awesome female cast. I thought James looked horrible in the previews but he's not bad in his role at all. I also think Jai Courtney is always interesting to watch and it's funny to see Miles Teller as Woodley's bitter rival (after last seeing those two as lovers in 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW', which was one of the best movies of last year). Winslet, Judd, Q and especially Woodley are all of course outstanding in the female roles and I thought the whole film was just really well put together. I especially liked the main message of the movie; that it's good to be different and an independent thinker (even if you're seen as a threat to the conformist way of life) because being unique is definitely something to look up to. It's great that 'THE HUNGER GAMES' has raised the bar so high for movies like this because now we get much better quality films because of it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UY2UtXfI_w","

"Divergent","jshaw20","22 March 2014","The question everyone who hasn't seen the film, Divergent, wants to know: is Shailene Woodley as effective as Jennifer Lawrence? The difference is in the character development and plot, something neither actress could do anything about.Woodley is as engaging as the rest of the cast that includes Theo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q and Ray Stevenson. Woodley, who looks like she could be Lawrence's sister, was seriously considered for The Hunger Games, and was expected to have the lead in Catching Fire, but Lawrence made it back. Catching Fire has a more decipherable plot than The Hunger Games. Woodley's ""Tris"" in Divergent is as wonderful as Lawrence's character, ""Katniss."" It's easy to love them both.Divergent, a young adult book transferred to film, is as entertaining as any following the dystopian trend that includes The Hunger Games and its sequel, Catching Fire. For adults who enjoyed those films, then Divergent does it one better. Not that The Hunger Games was not a good film; it was done very well. However; the society and logic for the games don't work for all some of us reality-thinking adults.If we were thinking on a broader scale, we might ask a lot of questions if we wanted to, but we don't. These films, including Divergent, based on young adult books, are voyeuristic in that they involve prying observation of ""our own children"" represented on screen. We want to see our children brave, heroic and caring. We'd like them to save the world we messed up. For grown-ups, Divergent and The Hunger Games are still vicarious thrills. We love watching the young win--even it is against others the same age. As long as those hurt or killed are deserving (meaning bad guys) or going to kill the good guys.What makes Divergent different from the rest (and I don't pretend to know all the films made or being made in this vein today) is that the scene is on a larger scale and the young are entry-level to the scene. Their journey is just beginning. Grown-ups have already screwed things up by dividing society by its values. Evil has the usual melodramatic pervasiveness in these films; there is always a villain to make what seems to be a good plan (the world as it is presented to us) even better.That said, Divergent is a decent science fiction film that teaches a lesson to society--or by direct consumption-- teenagers in the world. Teens have questions about who they are or who they should. They questions their actions and reactions constantly. Unlike utopias that portray a perfect world, dystopias portray a world in need. Teenagers, needy or not, can identify with a world in need. The audience or reader sees the distorted world vision, but the characters--the society does not. To be dramatic, most dystopian science fiction we see on film is usually so dark and so grim as to be unrealistic. Most of the world is destroyed by war either among themselves or by aliens.Good science fiction tackles what we should or shouldn't do as a society when it comes to science or technology. And, especially for film, I think it helps to have a positive ending.","

Peter came off as a light hearted jerk instead of a dangerous sociopath and Four just happened to suddenly like Tris. These were important things to develop. Instead, time was taken to have a show down with Janine at the end??? It wasn't just the deviation from the book. I saw this movie with a Divergent-virgin and he asked me multiple times if it was almost over. He felt lost and confused. I understand when movies are changed because the book just doesn't play out but that did not appear to be the case.This was very disappointing and I frankly expected more with Roth being part of the production team.","

"Divergent","ma-cortes","30 December 2018","Thrilling first installment of a successful trilogy, dealing with a stirring dystopian Sci-Fi in which a beautiful and intelligent adolescent becomes involved into lots of dangers, risks, emotion and violence. As Tris, Shailene Woodley, will be forced to make complex choices about sacrifice, loyaly, courage, love
redemption and allegiance. This is a Science Fiction and drama film based on Veronica Roth novel. Sixteen-year-old Tris Prior : Shailene Woodley, lives in a destroyed city of Chicago, in a difficult society divided into factions and, nowadays, she searches answers on the ruins of the town. As each faction represents a diverse way of handling things. Candor are the honest. Erudite are the intelligent, in which her brother, Ansel Elgort, belongs. Abnegation the selfless, in which her parents : Ashley Judd, Tony Goldwyn belong. Amity the kind. And finally Dauntless the brave, in which Tris enlists herself after an extremely dangerous training . The Erudite led by Kate Winslet , have declared war against Abnegation because they think that they have essential information about Divergent. Then the Erudite scheme a massacre against Abnegation. Then, Tris unlocks secrets , uncovering horrible deeds and along with his partners and with the help from others on his side carry out a strong fight against a nasty alliance run by Kate Winslet which threatens to tear their society apart. Tris takes desperate, disturbing choices, and makes difficult decissions to protect the ones she loves, and, finally, discovering the shocking truth.This first part contains thrills , chills , noisy action, high body-count , breathtaking state-of-art-special effects, enough characterization , and violent happenings . Here our starring Tris faces one impossible challenge after another, as she unreveals the truth about her past and, ultimately, the meaning of the strange and mysterious divergence, as well as the dark future on her sad world . The movie relies heavily on the long interrogatory with excessive use of machines, and abstract images on the dreams performed by Tris , as it turns out to be tiring, confusing and a little bit boring. It is followed by Insurgent 2015 by Rober Schewenke in which Tris approaches the residents of Amity led by Octavia Spencer and meet the factionless and Four's, Theo James, mother : Naomi Watts. And finally, the conclusion and unexpected denouement : Allegiant. Stars Shailene Woodley who gives nice acting as the valiant teen who is really haunted by her past, as well as she must confront her inner demons. She is well accompanied by a good support cast to be with her in the three entries, such as : Ray Stevenson, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Zoe Kravitz, Jay Courtney, Mekhi Phifer, Maggie Q, Ben Lloyd Hughes, and Kate Winslet.The picture has a colorful and brilliant cinematography by Alwin Kuchler. And a thrilling and rousing musixal score by Junkie XL. The flick was well directed by Neil Burger, though it results to be overlong and a little bit tiring. However, Neil did not make the second outing, as he couldn't due to scheduling conflicts with postproduction in this Divergent 2014. Burger is a good professional director who has got some successes as cinema as TV. As he has directed notorious films as The illusionist, Limitless, Interview with an assassin, The upside. And TV series and episodes as Billion, Books, the jury TV, The asset TV, among others. Rating : 6, decent Science Fiction movie that will appeal to teenagers. Well worth watching.","

I was oblivious to this movie and hadn't picked up anything about it before watching it so viewed it with a clean slate.What I was exposed to was some of the worst dialogue, some of the most unlikeable characters, terrible plot elements but the biggest annoyance of all: the whole base of this movie is aimed at teenagers who believe they're ""special"" (= divergent).I'm sure to teenagers this would be entertaining but the movie doesn't hold up to any criticism. It feels as if it was written by a very inexperienced 12 year old with all the issues and downsides that come with this.","

"Divergent","dromasca","7 April 2017","Based on a trilogy of books written by Veronica Roth, Divergent brought to screen by Neil Burger begins as many other similar dystopian films years after the civilization as we know was destroyed by war. One of the surviving pockets is the city of Chicago. In the retro-futuristic ruins that we know from many other films the local community survives by having itself divided into five strict casts, with well defined social roles - agricultural production, justice, social assistance, policing and defense. One has to chose once base on some kind of a hipno-test that detects his abilities and recommends the future path. There is no return. Outfits are thrown out of the system in kind of a homeless world. Those who do not fit into the patterns are feared, and eliminated when identified. They are the Divergents.The film is the story of one of them - a teenage girl who chooses to train to become part of the more exciting military-policing cast - or maybe two if we add her trainer who has one secret in his pocket - as they fight the system, try to adapt, but do not find their way of integrating, so they revolt. The premises are almost as strict as the social rules of the world that is being described in the film, and it would have taken quite a lot of talent and character building in order to overcome a simplistic approach. Unfortunately this is not the case, and the film hesitates between a future vision which is not original enough and a teenage fighting adversity story which is not complex or interesting enough.Director Neil Burger of The Illusionist fame quite disappoints here. I should say that he disappoints again, as after that 2006 movie he never got back to the level of story and characters building that he reached there. He never succeeds to exceed the clichés of the The Hunger Games genre. No, this is not supposed to be a compliment. Divergent is too much resembling many other films of its genre, the young Shailene Woodley and Theo James act well but they are no Jennifer Lawrence and the presence of Kate Winslet in a well built supporting role is not enough to save this film from a very average grade. Divergent is missing some more divergence.","

"Divergent","hannahmiley11","22 March 2014","I don't know what the other reviewers went and saw but as a MAJOR fan of the books I can say that Divergent was AMAZING. As the title states, it was the best book-to-movie adaptations yet. It was so accurate and was so honest to the books that it just blew my mind. Ever scene was so true to the books that it amazed me. Of course they had to cut out a few minor scenes for the length but I have never been so proud and happy. It was a really long movie like about 2 hours and 30 minutes give or take and I'm glad it was so long because they had a chance to include everything. The acting was great. Shailene Woodley was pretty great, she really understood Tris and Theo James and her chemistry was really beautiful. I really really liked the movie and I want to go see it again. I am so very impressed and I really look forward to Insurgent.","

"Divergent","gndecastro","24 March 2014","Awesome movie. The movie plays with the theme that society tries to force us into a specific box when we really wish we were free to do many different things with our lives. The story exaggerates this theme by reducing people to five different personality types. Once they reach adulthood, all people are forced to choose and live by one set of rules only. The main character, Tris, does not fit conveniently into any one type so she is considered dangerous because she cannot be controlled. Even though this is being compared to Hunger Games (young people in combat in a dystopian future), it is actually completely different. Only the setting is the same. There were a few minor details that could have been corrected. This is a must watch for any fans of Sci-Fi, action, or even if you just like to see a female in a lead role. Loved it. P.S. - If you have not yet seen the trailer, watch it after the movie. It revealed a bit too much.","

This falls into the NOT box.If someone can tell us what it was supposed to be then we will listen ; until then we shall watch the Hunger Games again.Still, it made someone rich.

"Divergent","edwardanthony9","20 March 2014","Not quite the quality of The Hunger Games, but still have its own persona and unique setting. The story takes time to find its feet, and while the action sequences was great, the vast number of characters kind of put things in the mix for this decent young adult novel adaptation.The world felt a bit weird and extreme at first, and it takes time before we can finally believe and be immersed in the world. Meanwhile, story-wise was great in the bigger picture, but the first half of the film was all about Dauntless and so it flows in a very narrow scope. Afterwards, the bigger picture is revealed, when we finally realize the significance of ""Divergent"" characters, and the scale of the conflict. That's when the story kind of takes a hard turn and get going for a full blast finale.The vast number of characters makes it hard to follow most of the supporting characters, making things a little confusing, all the while making us less caring for them. Yet, this also means that we can kind of like the main protagonists. With all the different kind of characters, those we want to hate, those we don't care for, leaving us with the main protagonists to like and root for. This is perhaps the reason why we can care for them emotionally, despite the less emotional nature of the unfolding plot. The first half of the film has no drama for us to feel, while in the second, there was too much of drama where we end up getting lost emotionally (in the end, all I care about is the two main protagonists).The visuals were great, and so were the action sequences, supported by a decent soundtrack with some very likable themes as well. The villain of the film was interesting on its own & fresh for a new franchise like this, and the acting by Kate Winslet was also brilliant, but to be frank, they will need a more threatening & challenging villain if they are to up the stakes for the sequels (truthfully, it is well decided in the novels already, but given that I don't read them, I cross my fingers that the next villain will prove more challenging). The twist towards the end is interesting, and quite a nice touch as well. Meanwhile, the ending felt much too abrupt and unfinished, and it just begs of a sequel to come fast.VERDICT:Good: Great visuals & action, Decent soundtrack, Unique setting, Vast array of characters (mixed)Bad: Takes time to find its feet, Abrupt endingSCORE: 7.0(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)","

The divisions are not quite logical and lead to overlap.As with ""Brave New World"" and a dozen or so similar stories, there are deviants, oops ""Divergents"" or people that do not fit in and rock the boat.Little Tris (Shailene Woodley) is one of the deviants. She survives puberty with the help of her mentor Four (Theo James).

"Divergent","KineticSeoul","25 July 2015","Watching this movie was like watching ""Twilight"" (except nowhere near as bad), ""The Hunger Games"" (Because of government Totalitarian, ""Harry Potter"" because of the class system and factions, and a bit of ""Inception. Overall this is another teenage romance movie that totally has that written by the mind of a teenage girl that fantasize a lot all over it. But this one is impressive for something that has been written by a girl in her early 20's. I could tell how this story emulates from other stories, but it has enough creativity to make it it's own. Although the ""Inception"" like device that works like something along the lines of the Scarecrow fear gas concept can be a little too much. Even if it plays a big role in the story. So what this movie is, is a sci-fi dystopia romance flick about couple of teens standing up and rebelling against a over controlling government. So yeah, the premise has been done before. Especially in certain animes. This movie is directed pretty well and the cinematography is decent for a movie such as this. But I actually liked the message behind this movie, which revolves around choosing your own path and not be fearful of what others think of you. That your life is your own and others should not play a part in controlling or manipulating you. Overall, this movie was alright. I thought it was a okay watch and I don't mind seeing the sequel ""Insurgent"".6.7/10","

"Divergent","strong-122-478885","7 April 2015","Ho-hum!.... So, ask me if I was at all surprised (even slightly) when (guess what?) Divergent's totally, starry-eyed, little tale of the future was conveniently twisted into yet another full-blown Romeo & Juliet story where, this time around, teenage jocks (both male & female) plunged head-long into serious training to become the coveted ""Dauntless Ones"".And was I at all surprised to find out that Divergent's futuristic society was, once again, a nation that blindly preached peace through total threat and enforcement of violence?.... No. I was not surprised. Not in the least.If you ask me this utterly pretentious, $85 million production was just another version of ""The Host"", but, of course, this time it was all done on a much grander scale, with definite shades of ""Starship Troopers"" thrown in for good measure.At 2 hours and 20 minutes, Divergent really pushed the limits when it came to being tolerable entertainment. In general, I thought that most of the cookie-cutter characters in the story were just a bunch of shallow, two-faced, arrogant snots and I couldn't have given a sweet-damn whether they ever triumphed in their goody-goody, little mission, or not.All-in-all - Divergent was nothing but superficial fluff marketed exclusively for a very gullible, non-thinking audience.","

But this movie appears to be nothing else but another attempt to corrupt naive girls and boys into the ""You are the chosen one"" story-type. In every single second I could feel how much this movie tried to be the next Harry Potter ripoff, just like Hunger Games did it. Juveniles get categorized into dumb superficial ""fractions"" like HP did it with Slytherin, Griffyndor etc. to address the teenage-viewers desire for belonging to a team and having a clear enemy, there's one of the most predictable and unsophisticated romance-story lines involved I've ever seen, the whole set and the actors make one feel like watching a low-budget production, there is so few thought and logic behind this movie, that the constant super-serious atmosphere just makes it even more of a second hand embarrassment. When I left the theater with my father I quickly tried to change the topic to avoid mocking around. If you are a 12 year old girl you will love this movie, if not, you'd find better entertainment in a ""Happy Meal""","

"Divergent","filipemanuelneto","14 February 2021","After the resounding success of ""Hunger Games"", American studios were hungry for more films and trilogies for young adults. ""Maze Runner"" and ""Divergent"" were two of the most evident, with scripts and source material that, in everything, remind us of ""Hunger Games"". In this film, the beginning of another trilogy, we are presented with a dystopian future: the human race faced the Third World War and almost died out.In order to regain peace, the survivors grouped in the city of Chicago and created factions, in which they engaged according to their vocation: Erudite grouped intellectuals, teachers and scientists; Amity did the same with farmers, manufacturers, artisans and traders; Candor includes magistrates, lawyers, bailiffs and lawmakers; Dauntless welcomed the police and military; the Abnegation brought together civil servants, doctors, nurses, social workers and all those who dedicate their lives to helping others. By their characteristics, they are also the political leaders. The faction is chosen in adolescence, after a vocational test that should help, or even indicate, to which faction you belong. There are also those who have no faction or have left theirs, and who live in misery. In a system where the faction is more relevant than family, being without a faction is being excluded from society.The young protagonist is Beatrice, or Tris, whom the vocation test indicated belonging to more than one faction, that is, being a Divergent, a serious threat to the faction system. Choosing to join the Dauntless, she will face serious difficulties to integrate and pass the tests presented to her. To make matters worse, her father, who is one of the leaders of the Abnegation, is being questioned by the strength of the Erudite, led by the cruel Jeannine, eager to rise to power, albeit by violence.I really liked the movie, overall. At the time it was released I felt it went quite unnoticed, overshadowed especially by ""Maze Runner"". Now that some years have passed and the success of the competitors has faded, it was interesting to see this film, I felt that I could appreciate it better and that the film has aged well until now. The story is good, it holds us to the end, and it develops in an engaging way.The cast is quite good and competent at what they should do. I especially liked Shailene Woodley, who I didn't know until I saw her here. She is good at what she does, she has talent and, on a more personal note, she is identical to an old flame of mine, which is almost the same age as her, and that of course made me remember my own past. Theo James was also excellent, particularly in the action scenes, where he seems cut out for the role. Miles Teller is just as good, especially considering that his character is hateful. Equally worthy of our hatred is the character of Jai Courtney, who is very good at the task of being rude, brutish and somewhat sadistic. Kate Winslet is cold and insensitive, and in fact she performed very well, but I don't know if I would bet on her as the first choice for the character. The film also features Zoe Kravitz, Ansel Elgort and Ashley Judd.Technically, the film is visually impressive. The cinematography is excellent, vibrant and sharp, and I loved the landscapes of a half-destroyed and decadent Chicago, of dry rivers and lakes, and devastated buildings. Incredible, but not coherent: if the entire human population was there, wouldn't more space be needed? Why not rebuild all? Didn't they have two hundred years of peace to do so? Another thing I liked and found amazing was the action and fighting sequences. Really well executed. I also liked to see Intrepid climb buildings with ease ... in a city that is famous for its strong winds (another logic problem that can only be forgiven for being less relevant). The sets and costumes were very well done and the soundtrack also fits into the overall set.","

"Divergent","Fashionatic","3 February 2015","I didn't watch this when it came out in movie theaters because I thought the preview looked stupid and basic. I was partially right. It is a basic form of a dystopia fighting to become a utopia. It is very similar to the hunger games which is why I dropped from 10 to 9 in ratings. Other than it being too similar to the hunger games, it was a good movie. I was not expecting both of Tris' parents to die. I did wish Tris and Four had more scenes together. Maybe in their new series they will explore their relationship further. I was not a fan of how it ended. Tris and Four just left the dystopia with all the leaders still alive. Obviously, they will come back for revenge. Overall, I can watch it over and over again because they picked a very good cast. I also underestimated Shailene. I use to watch her ""secret life"" show on ABC family, so I was expecting her to be an over dramatic character. She played this part well.","

"Divergent","The-Sarkologist","12 April 2014","I'm not really sure about this movie because it seemed to be a little rushed, especially at the end. In fact it seemed to be one of those movies where a young person joins the army, spends three quarters of the movie doing basic training, and then the last quarter of the movie going out and saving the world – the only difference is that this movie is set far in the future after a major war where society has split into five interdependent clans that are each based upon a virtue (bravery, honesty, compassion, etc) and that once one joins a clan (based on a ceremony at the age of 16) then one cannot step out of the clan into another clan. The people are also tested to see which clan they best suit, however during that testing it can come out that one does not necessarily fit into a single clan, making them divergent.To be honest with you I could not really see how the idea of the divergent being dangerous was and why they needed to kill them. In fact the whole concept didn't really work all that well for me. It wasn't a bad movie, if in a way you don't mind a bit of action, but on the whole it didn't seem to make all that much sense, with the whole section involving the training and then the attempted coup at the end. This further added problems to the whole concept, namely that if the system had been set up to prevent conflict in the future, then why was it that, all of a sudden, a conflict arose in the form of an attempted coup. It seemed that, on the basis of the plot of the movie, that the whole system has essentially failed.There is also some Christian themes in the movie, which have come about from the author's statements that she is a Christian, and when one looks at it one can see right-wing Christian ideas coming out of this book. Basically it represents the ongoing conflict between the extreme church (as represented by Abnegation) and the extreme scientific community (as represented by Erudite) however, it also comes down in how you perceive the nature of the story, because Abnegation can also represent that aspect of society that supports the planned, egalitarian society, while the Erudite supports a free-market, might means right, form of society, and we see these aspects within the warrior caste, where those that don't make the grade are cast out and become factionless, and then the apparent coup against the ruling faction on the grounds that they horde the food, and hand it out to those who do not work for it.","

"Divergent","adamjohns-42575","16 August 2021","There is a definite hunger games vibe to this film. Not just in the storyline, but even in the way and the style that it is filmed. I do wonder, however, whether it might not have been better received it had been released first?I don't personally think that Shailene Woodley was the best choice as the lead, although I haven't read the books yet to say that she isn't a good version of the author's character.Theo James is not only handsome, but he plays his part well and although he's annoying, so does Miles Teller. I think that perhaps if the film hadn't been so rushed, we would have seen more of them both. Having said that, I did struggle to tell some of the male characters apart.There are times when I found the violence to be a bit much. I will never understand why some military branches feel the need to beat the strength out of people. Everyone has a place, it might just be admin or Medicine instead of fighting.It's not a bad story, it's just one we already know. It's a shame that there are so many of a similar ilk out there now. They may have all shined individually if they hadn't all come at once, but it's fairly obvious what will happen, because in one way or another, we've seen it all before.I have to say though, that I think this is Kate Winslet's best performance yet.","

"Divergent","billygoat1071","21 March 2014","Divergent has recently been called the next big thing. People are expecting this series to match with Harry Potter and mostly The Hunger Games. It could be just another one of those dystopian future tales that revolts against a tyrannical government, but the concept sounds a little transcendent that can somehow relate to the young adult readers. But the story itself is lacking a definite center, forcing the action to come out when it needed to without any slow burn at the ticking bomb. It's almost like any of the genre's generic films: exposition over substance. Though the exposition here is at least more than great visuals, it manages to make it all exciting despite that it generally isn't. Divergent is competent in filmmaking, but mediocre on themes.The films has a decent way to introduce the world and it truly is intriguing to explore the surfaces. It's so intriguing, the actual storytelling ends up being contrived without any growth. The threat just suddenly distracts the nearly endless exposition, but what really suffers is the subtext. The film doesn't seem to be interested in snagging its thematic potential, all what this narrative is capable of is innovating. This is a common problem to the YA genre, apparently, and the momentum and conflict once again just pops up out of nowhere.This underwhelming storytelling is thankfully carried by a more fascinating and delicious vision. Neil Burger creates it into larger-than-life, and they are much entertaining than what the script tries to deliver. Everything just moves briskly and makes sure that it doesn't miss a satisfying thrill. The coolest scenes are proof that these filmmakers have big ambition to the project and yet the narrative fails to justify it. The cast has also done well. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are competent enough as the heroes, and Kate Winslet somewhat elevated her villainous character.Divergent could be like one of those vapid YA's such as Beautiful Creatures, Mortal Instruments, or whatever. Except this one is probably the best among since it has a craft that at least made it watchable. But then the meat is not well defined. It's frustrating because the ideas are just right there on display and you don't know where the potentials have gone. The bright side is there are more cool sequences, like the zipline ride and the wannabe parkour from a train (with the Woodkid soundtrack), than mouth sucking subplots that the genre has been iterated in years, we could use more of that. But there are bigger things to complain here, there really seems to be something far more compelling beneath the concept. So for now, we at least get a movie that has better focus to intrigue our imaginations and not teenage hormones.","

"Divergent","Movie_Muse_Reviews","3 September 2014","In the world of young adult book adaptations with a fantasy/science fiction edge, ""Divergent"" is one of the few to actually fall in between really good and intolerable. It's no ""Hunger Games,"" but director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and writers Evan Daugherty (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") and Vanessa Taylor (""Game of Thrones"") do a respectable job bringing the Veronica Roth novel to life with maturity and actual filmmaking talent.Having read the book, it's kind of in the same boat. It's not as good as the first ""Hunger Games"" book but it has that same adult, ultra-violent tone with romantic subplots that don't overtake the plot but rank a clear second to it. The dystopian world of ""Divergent"" is far more complicated than ""Hunger Games,"" which widens in scope as the trilogy continues instead of turning the whole world it has built on its head in book one as ""Divergent"" does. Essentially, ""Divergent"" the movie is as good as the material allows it to be, meaning its faults run as deep as those of its source material.That said, ""Divergent"" is an intriguing and engaging story, even if it feels unpolished at times. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) is a teen living in one of society's five factions in dystopian Chicago. She has reached the age when young people are tested to find out which faction (all of which are based on different virtues) they are best suited to, though in the end they are given a choice no matter what the results say. When Beatrice takes the test, her results are inconclusive. This means she's divergent; she doesn't belong in just one faction, and in a world where everyone is supposed to fit in a specific place, this is dangerous. She chooses to leave her selfless faction, Abnegation, for the bravery and free-spiritedness of Dauntless.Woodley's talent and career trajectory suggests that Summit Entertainment was going for the next Jennifer Lawrence-type to play Tris and she's as good as it gets. With the book being told from the Tris' perspective, it's incumbent on her to communicate the many feelings that Roth so excellently expresses in the book and she does. The rest of the cast isn't too bad either, though only Theo James as Four, Tris' Dauntless mentor-turned-love interest, gets much of a platform. He's every bit of mysterious, dark and handsome as the part necessitates.""Divergent"" sacrifices these side characters in the name of bringing all the memorable plot points of the story to life and explaining Roth's highly intricate dystopian world. There's nothing simple about the faction system for those who haven't read the books, so it eats up some screen time. And with so many scenes and moving pieces, there's little breathing room in the screenplay. The other initiates that Tris befriends (or tangles with) in Dauntless who keep the story grounded in a lot of ways don't develop in the film so that parts including Tris' experiences in the fear simulations, the capture the flag scene and more can all have space in the final cut. ""The Hunger Games"" took a similar philosophy, to let the main character be the real emotional focus of the film and to shut others out, but again, ""Divergent"" is more complicated, and the story doesn't have emotional turning points in the same way ""Hunger Games"" does.Artistically, however, the adaptation does a nice job, even if it borrows on the ""Hunger Games"" aesthetic a little. Burger nails the test and fear simulation scenes, in which Tris experiences a lifelike simulation induced by a serum. He gives them the eerie, larger-than-life quality they require but in a natural way that outdoes the average film's creepy nightmare sequence. The adrenaline rush of Tris' dauntless adventures also comes through. Speaking as a Chicagoan, it would have been nice to see more of the city's actual aesthetic in the film, which is essential to this series, but there's more potential for that in the sequels.So many young adult novel adaptations have been made, and maybe barely 10 percent manage to become ""Twilight"" or ""The Hunger Games."" It isn't and won't become those (even though it's better than ""Twilight""), but ""Divergent"" proves there is room for a successful middle ground in this genre, something it desperately needed.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

"Divergent","vgale-31-601397","8 April 2014","**May contain spoilers** My partner god bless her loves these books and seeing it was part of her birthday week I relented and went with her to see it. To be honest from what little she had told me (or I had forgotten) this would be one of those ""chalk up the brownie points and suffer through deals"".I'll try not to knock the book as I haven't read it but from what I've seen in this movie and from the reaction of my partner, I may just have to read it to see how this went so terribly wrong from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the books and the perspective of someone who has.First: Where was the lead in? not sure why there was a war or who it was against? but that may help the audience understand the concept of the factions or the actual reason for the story.Secondly: Where was the character development or more so the relationship between them, I mean the deaths of the parents in this movie meant less to me than any other movie I've seen, I felt nothing and geeze... you could see it coming from a mile away. The father just threw his life away when they could of easily taken out the 5 or so guys in the room, especially with a number of them having their backs turned, let's not mention he walks into the middle of a hallway with no cover...And more: So they have to face their fears in the simulation but when they both go in Four doesn't seem afraid bar some sarcastic comments.Conclusion: Unless you're some fanatical fan I can't see how you could enjoy this movie, this was cringe worthy at best. If it hadn't been for my partners birthday I would of walked out and I'm still upset I didn't... and trust me.. my partner was probably more upset about this steaming pile than I am and she's an avid fan of the books.","

"Divergent","mh-hirschfield","9 July 2015","I had heard nothing about this movie before I began to watch it. After seeing the first 10 minutes, I can confidently say that I could predict the mind numbing 6 plus hours remaining in the trilogy. There are so many things wrong with this (recurring) movie adapted from the same model based on books with the same recurring story (characters, themes, etc.).This laughable new genre of Teen Trilogies are todays version of the Mad-Libs books from my grade school days... except they are unable to turn the page to another storyline, are restricted to the same repetitive word bank and only able to exhibit originality through the cool first names assigned to the leading female protagonist.The next Trilogy should be centered on a young author who discovers that all books are now only written by huge corporations aimed at maximizing profits (through follow up movies, documentaries, theme parks and related products) and how he/she plans on burning the whole boring system to the ground.","

"Divergent","drqshadow-reviews","5 August 2014","With the flood of teen lit-inspired movies on the scene today, it can be all-too easy to unfairly shuffle them all under the same leaky roof. Often, that short-sells the more gleaming examples of the genre. Not so with Divergent, a ruthlessly narrow little bit of phony escapism that confirms every ugly stereotype. Dim and wooden, it's a thoroughly hand-holding bit of tack that can't seem to get over how breathlessly important it thinks it is. The generic core storyline has nothing to offer, over-familiar and rich with the scent of manufactured drama. Its cast, thin and transparent as they come, spends most of the bloated runtime reveling in their own majesty at the expense of actual character development. Not that the actors seem capable of exploring any such depth, were they given the material to work with. Shailene Woodley and Theo James, beautiful people without so much as a single spark between them, seem to have been chosen exclusively for their pouty appearances on the promotional materials. Likewise, an awkwardly mismatched sparkle-pop soundtrack stands at odds with the bleak, dystopian tones that the plot stretches for. At least the visual effects are well done, for what that's worth. It's a real waste of time and effort, an insulting vehicle to cash-in on the latest craze and promote a few of the parent company's tunes while they're at it. I wish I could get my two hours back.","

"Divergent","MrILoveTheAnts","22 March 2014","""Die A Virgin"" is the story of a girl trying to find her place in the world. But the factions want her dead for some reason or other, I think it's because she's can lucid dream while doing acid. It's not very well explained.For $80,000+ million dollars this movie actually looks really good. It's a nice semi-original looking world, like a mix of ""I Am Legend,"" with ""Aeon Flux."" All of the exterior shots were great, but interiors really needed some work. I don't think they could afford chairs or feature really. There's a lot of people in mono-colored rooms all wearing the same colored cloths. All the guns, whether they're the training guns, the real guns, or the future guns, all make the same fake zappy sound effect that make people just want to lay on the ground regardless of where they got shot. This removes the emotional impact to the audience has when someone actually gets shot so when people die it's like nothing happened at all. Actually the lead girl gets shot in the leg in one scene and is up and about running in the next. The hand to hand combat is nice but then there are these flat shootouts where people are just hiding behind cover, shooting at one another. These shootouts lack the creativity of a good action movie.Her parents are throw away characters who show up for these bland shoot outs and ...*** Spoilers *** ... die almost immediately. Shailene Woodley is a decent lead and does a good job of acting when her mother dies, but because this is just a women that might as well just have a name tag that says ""MOM"" on it, I just didn't care. They needed a tender moment or two to establish what this women actually meant to Tris, a little thing she did as a child, or something with her hair, a saying or something that becomes her last words, Something! She has a tattoo I think so that's something but not exactly the same as being the women who put a flower in her hair when she was young. It doesn't help that she's wearing gray for the entire movie either! They're just bland characters that get shot and I really think it's just to spice up these shootouts? So the end of the movie happens and they kill all the people in the room except for Kate Winslet's character. And they forget to kill her on the way out, I'm guessing because they need to make two squeals out of this piece of crap. This is the women who basically started a war and orchestrated the mass genocide of Tris's family and faction. I really wished this movie had the balls to have Tris grab her by the hair, drag her out into the street, and effing execute her for her crimes against humanity... but nope, we have to complete this lack luster 90 minute love story between Tris and Four. She has to say things like ""Both my parents died today,"" apparently without any tears coming out of her eyes either! They have to flee the city on this run away train no one seems to be driving for some reason or other too.","

A dystopian future (how many of those have we seen?) set in Chicago, where life is divided into 5 sanctions, and Tris's ""test"" in inconclusive and she winds up choosing the ""dauntless"" sanction and surviving a rather brutal militaristic set of tests to get in. It turns out her mother went thru the same thing.The movie features decent action scenes and good performances as well as some good scenes where they try to ""scare"" the people trying to get into dauntless.

"Divergent","BrentHankins","20 March 2014","Big budget adaptations of popular young adult novels have become the latest trend in Hollywood, with each major studio hoping to create the next Twilight or Hunger Games phenomenon. While many of these quick cash-in attempts have resulted in embarrassingly low box office returns, Summit Entertainment's Divergent, based on the bestselling novel by Veronica Roth, could very well be the proverbial ""next big thing.""In the future, society has been divided into five factions, each with a defining personality trait and a specific social role to fulfill. At the age of sixteen, each member submits to an aptitude test designed to guide them into choosing a permanent faction, but Tris (Shailene Woodley) is shocked to learn that she is ""divergent,"" showing equal aptitude for more than one faction. Not only is Divergence rare, but many consider it to be a dangerous condition that could threaten the delicate societal balance, and Divergents are routinely met with ""accidents"" that leave them in a body bag.In order to distance herself from her family members and keep them from discovering her secret, Tris elects to join the Dauntless faction, an elite group of warriors tasked with defending the city. But Dauntless training is more than she bargained for, with a hostile fellow recruit (Miles Teller) garnering an obscene amount of pleasure from pummeling her in the combat ring while faction leader Eric (Jai Courtney) nods his approval. She finds comfort and solace in Four (Theo James), who seems to understand much more about her than she chooses to reveal, and who might be her only hope for salvation.Divergent spends a hefty amount of time building its world and establishing its characters, and despite stilted dialogue that finds itself in dire need of a punch-up, the relationships still feel genuine and relatable. Woodley and James have palpable chemistry, while Teller and Courtney play their villainous roles with gleeful abandon. Kate Winslet also has an enjoyable turn as a sinister government official whose interactions with Woodley are chill-inducing - expect her to play a major role in the eventual sequel.Divergent is at its best when the action finally gets rolling, which admittedly takes awhile due to the colossal amount of exposition required. Woodley never quite looks comfortable throwing punches and wielding weaponry, but her talent and charisma do a nice job of balancing the scales, and she carries the film admirably. By the time the credits roll, audiences should be entranced by Tris and eager to follow her along to the next step of her adventure.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com","

"Divergent","ifeedmedia","10 April 2014","I went to see this movie and i must say this is a special kind of horrible. Not one of the subplots made any since and most of the characters accept the leads were poorly introduced. They set up divergence as if it is a special ability but its not. Its just a tittle. The main character Trice never really comes off with anything that looks like a special ability. The fact that there are no contrasting examples of her special ability make her ability hard to see. She just a girl falling in love. The movie is slow as molasses and until you get to say 45mins into the movie you want to fall asleep. The plots are all incomplete and at the end you have no summary of what just happened.The society they set up in the movie is not realistic in anyway. The Dauntlets are basically a group of wild side party teens and they act like they are tough when none of then really show a capacity to fight or defend. Though the story sets them up as the defender or police of this world.There are pointless scenes like a zip-line scene that seems to come out of no where and have no relevance to the plot or the development of their NON-hero Hero. The movie is like a mesh of other films like, they use the color look of Twilight and try to set the 2 main character up in the same romantic way. The world reminds you much of The Hunger Games but has much much less action and much less relevance. There is even has a touch of Matrix to it accept with all that technology they had no gun that could fire in rapid succession. Everyone in the movie pulled guns and most of the time they did not shoot. Nothing is cohesive in this movie and I would rather you go see a re-airing of Spanglish, Tremors or Judge Dred if you want to see a much better movie. I am a guy so maybe this movie was made for ladies more than men but I really did not like this fragmented, inconclusive, cheesy movie. Any 4 year film student could have made it.","

It's so bad that we broke into laughter at some of the silly, stereotypical dialog and predictable plot elements. Kate Winslet walks through her part as though she'd been blackmailed into appearing. Kafka it is not. Not even close. It is obviously derivative of Hunger Games and does not even pretend to be the morality play or political satire that some seem to think it represents. The closest it comes to a ""genre"" is a Hong Kong martial arts film, but most of those are better. None of the characters act or react like real people.

"Divergent","Rob_Taylor","14 August 2014","So, it seems these days that the word 'dystopia' has come to mean 'any old nonsense society we can think of regardless of how impractical or unbelievable it is.' Snowpiercer, The Hunger Games, Total Recall (the remake) and so on, all share this common belief that any crazy society makes a viable setting just so long as you can gloss over the many, many cracks that even a moment's examination will discover.Divergent is just a variation of The Hunger Games, when it boils down to it, with teens being forced to do dumb things for the sake of the society. There are five factions, but the only one that would probably be of any interest to, you know, an actual teenager, is the slightly demented Dauntless clan. They run, they leap, they do dumb things, and all just because they can. They are essentially painted as the 'fun' faction and it is hard to imagine, given their rivals, that any teen would pick anything else at choosing time.Hmmm. Let's see... Farmer, Doctor, Lawyer, or Dogsbody. Or I could be a leaping, fun-getting Dauntless! Such a choice...There is also the nonsensical 'test' that all teens must take, but the results of which are generally pointless, since the teen can pick any faction at the time of choosing. Yet everyone gets all worked up about the test anyway, like it actual has a point.All of the usual teen concerns are on offer here, but it is hard to take any of it even remotely seriously. It's just so ham-fisted in its delivery of all these teen issues that it invites derision for the most part.Acting-wise, all is fair, though no one shines. Almost all of the population appear to be teens, though, with a handful of adults around to spoil the fun and almost no small children at all, which seemed odd.The main heroine goes through the motions of trying to fit in and failing, all the while falling hopelessly in love with her much older instructor. One begins to wonder if the writer had a crush on one of her teachers that went unfulfilled in her youth.All in all, an overlong exercise in endurance with a daft societal premise that just plain sets itself up for ridicule.SUMMARY: Too long, Too derivative. Only worth it if you are a teenage girl who doesn't get out much.","

"Divergent","nina_xue","10 April 2014","For those who haven't read the Divergent series by Veronica Roth, you might be wondering about all the similarities between this film and The Hunger Games – both set in a dystopian future with a very powerful 'state' controlling every aspect of life, society divided up into a number of classes and a fearless lead female who's willing to fight and take on the State. Well, you would have wondered right. But having said that, The Hunger Games turned into a massive box office success for a reason and if it ain't broke don't fix it right?I found the concept quite fascinating – society is divided into 5 different factions based on their personality traits. But, as expected with teenage fiction, it was a little too oversimplified for my liking. Another issue I had with the faction system was the overlap between Abnegation and Amity, as they both value kindness, peacefulness and forgiveness as their core life principles. So isn't Amity just a less extreme version of Abnegation, disguised as a bunch of barefoot hippies?But much in the way that The Hunger Games made us all wish we were the archery- extraordinaire brave enough to volunteer ourselves as tribute to save our doe-eyed younger sister alongside the boy who threw bread at us, there are also many qualities that are admirable in Tris. Perhaps a major difference between her and Katniss was the fact that Tris rejected the selfless values she was brought up with in favour of her true identity as Dauntless. At the heart of the film is a story about identity and having the courage to stay true to yourself. In that sense, while almost everyone could relate to the bravery and sacrifice in The Hunger Games, Divergent is targeted at a slightly younger age group.All in all, this was an entertaining film but don't try to read too much into the story. Staying quite true to the novel (although not as closely as The Hunger Games), the film in my opinion even improves on some aspects of the book. For example the final confrontation between Tris and Jeanine (Kate Winslet) flowed more smoothly than the scenes described in the novel.Shailene Woodley brought an added dimension of vulnerability in Tris, and there is just something fascinating about her that really makes you pay attention when she's on the screen. And Kate Winslet was excellent as always in bringing cold and calculating Jeanine to life.IMDb: 7.6/10Rotten Tomatoes: 40% (From projectreel: http://projectreel.wordpress.com)","

The divergent tells of the city of Chicago which was destroyed by war. To create peace, 5 factions formed according to personality. Abnegation that is unselfish and simple. Erudite is smart and prioritizes science. Good and peaceful Amity, Candor who prioritizes honesty, and Dauntless who is brave and free. Whereas Divergent are people who have more than one faction in their personality.
Children who are 16 years old must take a test to choose a faction. After the test, Tris has 3 results there are Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite. Tris must keep his identity as a Divergent. During the selection ceremony, Tris finally chose Dauntless. It turns out that only 10 people will be elected as official Dauntless members. Because of abstinence and intelligence, Tris managed to become a member of Dauntless.
But chaos occurs when Erudite controls Dauntless's brain to attack Abnegation. Tris who is not affected by serum pretends like the others. At that time, Tris knew that For was also a Divergent. Eventually an attack was carried out by Erudite against Abnegation. In addition, Divergent hunting is also underway. However, all can be thwarted by Tris, Four, Marcus, Caleb, and Peter. The five of them fled with the train go to beyond the wall.
This movie have an easy to understand path. In addition, the acting of the players successfully supports the story. Divergent films are in accordance with the character of teenagers who want to find their identity.","

"Divergent","Benjamin-M-Weilert","8 March 2019","While The Hunger Games really cornered the market in the ""young adult dystopian future"" category, many authors jumped on the bandwagon to cash in on this phenomenon. I'll admit that many of these series that got movie adaptations I had never heard of before and likely will not see/read. The Divergent series, though did stand out as the top of ""the rest"".It can be difficult to create a dystopian world, especially one that's at least somewhat set in our current one. The CGI-modified Chicago looks pretty good for a city that's been through what it has, but where the computer imagery really comes to shine is in the dream sequences. I would have liked them to be a little more obvious so the audience isn't always guessing if it's a dream or not, but that's part of the charm, I suppose. Having since read the book this was based on, I do have to say that the director made some good decisions on what areas to cut in order to keep the intent of the book, but at a pace that works better for a film. In fact, the dream sequences were even more difficult to pin down in the book than they were in the movie, so the film did a good job with that.However, this film still struggles with the ""teenage angst"" that many YA adaptations have. Of course, because of this and the aforementioned CGI, this film does get the feeling like it's a mashup of The Hunger Games and Avatar: The Last Airbender. That being said, the plot and societal structure felt thoroughly thought out and it truly helped distinguish between character archetypes when they are connected to specific colors.Surprisingly well-developed plot and characters with a good visual feel, I give Divergent 4.0 stars out of 5.","

"Divergent","fciocca","15 September 2019","This review will contain many spoilers regarding the story.Divergent is a movie with good premises, but since the beginning you already know that you are not going to watch an original movie. In fact for the whole duration I had a sense of Deja-vu: set in a dystopian future, after the ending of ""The War"" (?), the Chicago population is divided into 5 different factions. Everyone need to be fitted in one of these categories or you will end up as a homeless and factionless individual rejected by everyone. In order to decide which section you belong, you need to perform a test that tells which is the best faction for you, but during the ceremony day you get to decide which is the best option for you. Our main character is Tris, that during the test seems to belong to more factions. These people are called Divergents and cannot be controlled. They are considered really dangerous from the society and as soon as they detect one, they simply kill them.So, another movie that tells that nobody belongs to a fitted category, that anyone should think with their own brain, and should have their own idea. Nothing original, but premises remains okay. The main issue of this movie is the lenght: almost 2 hours and a half. The first hour is focused on Tris, that after choosing the Dauntless faction, basically the group dedicated to protect the population, tries to integrate herself inside the faction in the best way possible, even if she is clearly not fitted, a thing that insted of being slow cooked, could have been resolved with a short montage, or, if the director felt the need to elaborate on, in a 20 minutes sequence, saving the viewer from the boredom. Finally the story begins and everything is so predictable, including the love story with his trainer, that is in the air since the first moment they met. The main villain is an erudite that want to genocide an entire faction that manage the city, so she, with her faction can finally take over the government. In my opinion she is not very credible as a villain and in the end was also pretty easy to defeat.The acting is very flat, Shailene Woodley has the same expression for the whole movie, you cannot tell the diffference between happiness and sadness on her face and when she acts, she use always the same way of speaking. Theo James is the same. I wonder who did the casting and how they could pick so poor actors, especially if we are talking about the main ones.I will try to watch the complete trilogy, before saying that the entire saga is completely unworth to be watched, but this movie is in fact very predictable: it uses a narrative scheme very well known and that you see a lot nowadays. It is a brainless Hollywood movie made for early teenagers (like 14/15 years old, maximum), if, of course, they manage to go through the entire movie.I gave 4 stars out if 10 because CGI is on point and I really liked this distopian world. Also allucinations inducted by a special serum, are well studied.","

"Divergent","bemyfriend-40184","3 May 2021","It's for teen girls. Telling them to be brave, to be diversified. It's telling them to have many interests, and aspects to one's self. And that is a good thing. As a film, it was fine. The action was okay, the pace was okay, the characters and actors were fine. In my time, gender roles were very strict. Girls didn't do boy things; and boys didn't do girl things. I think the author of the story is trying to say that people are diversified. They are divergent. In the story, the leaders feared diversity; because it is harder to control. So they doubled down. But maybe if people were allowed to be free, they wouldn't be so mean.","

"Divergent","billy-94115","7 September 2015","Last year, I was dragged to this movie by my family. When the trailers were starting I said to myself, ""maybe it's not gonna be that bad, maybe I might really like it."". Then the opening narration started, and I knew I was going to be tortured. What followed was a long, (or at least felt long) crap-fest that rips off who knows how many movies. Bad acting, bad plot, bad action, and just plain bad. So far this is the only time I've fallen asleep in a theater. A lot of people are saying Shaliene Woodley is a good actress but after seeing this, I'm never going to agree with them. For Hollywood cash grabs, this is definitely one of the worst. To quote Roger Ebert, ""This is not scraping the bottom of the barrel, nor it is not under the barrel, it isn't ever the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be in the same sentence as the barrel."". People, save your money, skip this movie.","

An insult to human intelligence.The first 5 minutes of the film, focused on the essence. They where great. The rest of the long 2 hours where a bad mixture of the hunger games without the hunger, the matrix without mr Anderson, star treck without the stars, and dumb running, kicking, fighting, agonizing for no reason what so ever mambo jumbo. Overall quality? No better than a B class TV series. So why 7.4 in IMDb? Surely can't tell (paid reviews I presume). So I give a one star to balance things out. What is the message? In a future where mankind faces serious identity issues, where individuality is replaced by casts, where society is a threat to humanity... then what does one do??? Learn karate, pick up a gun and shoot the hell out of the bad guys!!! Wooaaoou! Totally mature and intelligent! I seriously prefer swangeneger's philoshopy 'Destroy da planat and get da hell oder heeer'.Hollywood's intention: Insult humans to the degree they begin to like it. Make ridiculous films so that every one turns into TV shows. Then keep serving them insulting TV shows... they won't mind... they are 'brain dead' to quality and originality. Thank's Hollywood, I'll pass (next time at least, cause I wasted 2 hours+ watching this crap).","

The way they advertised the movie I thought its going to be something but in real its nothing but a poor try to adopt a very good book. I was wondering all the time what is the big deal of being a divergent than when I came to know there was only one question ""so What?"".Personally I am a big fan of Shailene Woodley, I have already listed her as one of my favourite diva but watching this movie I would say she got beauty but no talent.

"Divergent","bryank-04844","17 August 2015","'Divergent',much like what it means to be a Divergent, never finds its pacing, story, or place in its 140 minute run-time, which is way to long in this case. The movie is unorganized, clunky, awkward, and cheesy. It never delivers a suspenseful atmosphere or on the gritty-mature nature of the story that it prides itself in having. Sure, it might have these aspects in the book version, but it is non-existent on film. I'm sure the word-of-mouth of this movie was not persuade movie-goers who are not familiar with the books to venture out and take a look, but those die-hard fans are sure to turn out in droves to see the hot male actors deliver their favorite lines.Again, the story takes place sometime in the future in a war-torn Chicago, where the remaining survivors of whatever happened are put into different factions to live and contribute to society at the age of 16. Each faction does something different whether it be lead, help others, grow food, or provide security. Much like when you're a teenager, trying to fit in to a certain group or discovering your true identity, each 16 year old is given a sort of test with hallucinogenic drugs that will tell them which faction they will most likely be in, which our main star Beatrice or Tris for short (Shailene Woodley) is labeled as a Divergent, which is bad news for society, as she doesn't exactly fit in with any faction. This means she can think on her own and not follow orders. People are supposed to report Divergents so they can be killed, but on the big ceremony day, these teenagers choose which faction they join for the rest of their lives.Only in this future, once you choose your faction, you can no longer see your family again if you choose a different faction from theirs and the one you grew up in. This isn't really explained in logical terms and doesn't make sense. Tris was born into the Abnegation faction, which is a peaceful and humanitarian group of people who lead the rest into a good future. But Tris seems to like the Dauntless faction, which provide security for people, and are loud, fun, and look like punk rockers. Hell, the way the even arrive looks fun as they jump off a moving train and and walk into the Choosing Ceremony like they were in some rock/rap music video, while the rest of the factions are in colored long robes, resembling a court judge.Upsetting her parents (Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn), Tris chooses Dauntless while her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) chooses Erudite, the faction that is all business and led by Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), who is quite good as a villain here. As soon as Tris joins her new faction, she and the rest of the recruits start training in the underground tunnels of a train line which is now home to the Dauntless. Since the Dauntless are the ""police"" of this new world, there is a lot of physical training to go through, which is led by Eric (Jai Courtney), a rough no-non- sense man who would kill his best friend in a blink of an eye. After the first hour of Tris going through physical exercises that would make a marine think twice and some full-contact fights with the other recruits, Tris realizes there is something much more sinister at work here than protecting the people.One of the leaders of Dauntless is called Four (Theo James), and notices something different about Tris on how's she' not like the rest. Four administers a series of more hallucinogenic tests to look for her fears and to see how she deals with these situations. But her test results always prove that she is a Divergent, but of course Four and Tris are attracted to each other so nobody finds out. We come to find out half way through the film that the Erudite faction is planning a takeover Nazi- Germany style by drugging the Dauntless into soldiers and killing every man, woman, and child that belongs to the Abnegation faction. Now Four and Tris must make out and destroy the Erudite faction's plans before blood is shed, all while they are under everyone's radar.This PG-13 movie never gets to gritty for people under thirteen, but it so desperately wants to be that. The interactions between the characters are clumsy and are not given enough time to feel any real emotion for when something drastic happens with the exception of Tris. There aren't really a whole lot of good fight scenes or big special effects either. This first installment in the 'Divergent' series seemed like one big 2.5 hour set-up for something bigger, that ultimately won't pay off. Woodley and Winslet are the best here as Winsley delivers her character with a vicious angle and Woodley gives a great and charming performance like she always does. A lot of people are saying that Theo James turns in a great performance here, but they are all wrong. His performance is one-note, boring, and has no energy. If this movie was James's demo reel, I would not cast him in anything in the future. Miles Teller, Jai Courtney, Mekhi Phifer, and Zoe Kravitz all turn up here as well, but aren't given a whole lot of screen time. But Teller as always is hilarious and great on-screen.The filming isn't that great either and seems like a paint-by-the-numbers shooting script than anything that would force us to think or entertain. The score is uninspired even though Hans Zimmer was credited as an executive score producer, and it never adds to any emotion or suspense happening on-screen. I guess 'Divergent' has nowhere to go but up.","

"Divergent","RossRivero99","15 December 2014","Neil Burger's Divergent is a bad film version of Veronica Roth's 2011 best-selling book of the same name set in a futuristic world in which there are factions that are based on somebody's virtue. It stars Shailene Woodley (who was brilliant in The Descendants (2011), but flopped in this movie) as Tris a girl who gets tested for some unknown reason and learns that she is ""Divergent"" and can't fit in, and ends up going to some training and also ends up falling in love with her instructor (played by Theo James in a very nauseating performance) whose name is hilariously the number Four and also meets another instructor named Eric (played by Jai Courtney whose performance reminds me of the way that Alfred Molina portrayed Johann Tetzel in Luther (2003). Then after that Tris finds out all of this information from her mother (played by Ashley Judd) and the culprit for the attempted Divergent destruction is a woman named Jeanine (played by Kate Winslet). There was a lot of other things that I didn't like about this film besides it's storyline but the acting, cinematography, directing, and especially the action sequences in which the action scenes were shot way too quickly, though i only liked two things in this movie which were the casting, and the stunt-work to the film.The one thing I don't get when it comes to watching it is when people like this film for no apparent reason at all but by just saying it's ""great"" though I had many reasons to criticize it, I do think that this movie is nothing compared to sci-fi classics like Inception (2010), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Planet of the Apes (1968), E.T. (1982), Minority Report (2002), or even Jurassic Park (1993) or The Matrix (1999). Unfortunately little did I know that this was going to be a regretful experiences that this I consider to be one of the year's worst films.","

"Divergent","RevRonster","8 October 2014","""Divergent"" makes me feel like I have to take a step back and preface that all my opinions on the film are made under the basis that I am fully aware that I am not the intended audience for the film. I'm a 33 year old man who collects comic books, plays video games, and spends too much money on comic conventions every year—I'm not the person that the production had in mind for watching ""Divergent."" However, they didn't have me in mind for ""The Hunger Games"" and I came around to be a fan of that franchise—although, I admit I didn't care for the first film.While the visuals are good and it really sells the dystopian future the film is set in, and the acting could have easily been a lot worse and, in reality, was pretty passable (although, you would think a film that has both Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd would have a little stronger performances), the film has just a way too predictable formula to really be anything but boring. I understand that this very specific subgenre that is the tween dystopia novel adaptations follow certain guidelines—all genres really do this—but ""Divergent"" felt like a ""fill in the blanks"" template for the tween dystopia film. The characters, the story, the unfolding origin of the backstory all play out exactly as you would predict it would as the opening credits begin. In fact, the film is so predictable that there is almost no need to watch it because, chances are, any prediction you make about it will come 100% true.I was pretty critical of the first ""Hunger Games"" film but the sequel won me over; however, I don't really see this happening with ""Divergent"" because the cast doesn't have enough great players thrown in, and the story, overall, is pretty bland and flavorless. Still, I won't rule out this franchise might get better and more interesting. After all, the boring beginning and the whole establishing the universe is now over so, theoretically, things can go up from herebut things can also theoretically go down, as well.","

"Divergent","batista_fan","27 March 2014","Last year, book to movie adaptations were very hit and miss. The Mortal Instruments City of Bones was an example of an absolute terrible adaptation. Completely butchered, over adapted to the point were it's like a parody of the source material. I'm not a purist, but it was simply down right sad. Nothing like the book. Then I saw Catching Fire which was an example of a near perfect book to movie adaptation. Characters nailed it, not over adapted, and properly paced. This movie Divergent however was exactly like The Mortal Instruments movie. As someone who read the books, this adaptation was an absolute embarrassment. One: This movie was over adapted! Too many important, meaningful scenes and components from the books were cut out, leaving us a Hollywood wrecked, cobbled together pretender of the book. Two: The evil characters were not evil. Plus an added bonus, most of them were devoid of character development Peter wasn't evil, he barely got any screen time! And his entourage of sociopaths, who oppressed and tried to kill Tris in the book were done terribly. Molly had two lines during the entirety of the film, and one was complimenting Tris! Drew was the worst, he was non-existent in the film. No screen time for him. And Eric, totally a one dimensional character. Lack any emotion or character development or even a reason for him to even exist in the story! Three: There was little to no conflict in this movie for the protagonist Tris. Without conflict, there is no narrative, no plot progression, and ultimately no entertainment value. Things were resolved so easy in the movie it was ridiculous. Tris is told she has failed initiation; which never happened in the books, and she just stays against orders of her superiors without complaint. What? Not plausible by any means. They should just cancel the squeal because there's no talent, evident of this movie. 1/10","

"Divergent","dierregi","1 April 2017","Our teenage female heroine is Tris. Like most adolescents she needs to be part of a group, establishing at the same time that she is much superior to her peers.In her society people are conveniently divided in 5 factions (actually, 6), according to virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite (plus the factionless, the pariah of the new society). At a certain age, teenagers must decide which faction to join, regardless of the faction of origin. They are previously tested to establish their main trait and make a better choice about the faction to choose.Choices outside their birth faction are frowned upon, but still allow for the protection of belonging to faction. Not so easy for Tris. She is ""special"", therefore a threat to society because she thinks ""independently"" - whatever that means.Those like her are called ""Divergent"" and are the object of a secret witch hunt. So Tris must succeed her initiation in the adult world, while hiding her true self. It could have been a mildly interesting story, but there are too many problems, both with the plot and the filming. What of the factionless? Are they also divergent or just lazy misfits? Why nobody seems to care about this main issue of their society? Isn't the elimination of the ""divergents"" too radical a way to deal with an alleged problem?Finally, instead of developing a comprehensive plot, half of this very long movie is devoted to Tris' initiation into the Dauntless faction. Scene after scene are about her tests and trials moving the plot nowhere, except for the introduction of a dumb love story.Targeted to the same audience of The Hunger Game, this is yet another movie that made me check the time more than once. It drags along forever and the ending is so open and silly that one can hear it screaming out loud for a sequel.","

"Divergent","dewimutiah","20 March 2014","If you have read the series, you might understand the stories underlying this community mess, dividing it into five factions based on one different virtue. Of course a group of people living with only one virtue would cause chaos inside the one faction itself and affecting the society. But here, the other problem is, when your mind can't be fitted into any group, you'll be called divergent, and they'll hunt you down. That was what happened on Tris (Woodley).About the plot itself was lack of surprise for me. All the flaws of the plot originally came from the book. All about this messy complicated world, was introduced at the first part of the movie. I think it was the hardest part for Burger to explain the audience about the world of Divergent. You'll find it confusing and somehow boring. I love how Burger dealt with this. The way he built up the character of Tris turned this movie into a beautiful journey if a young woman leaving her family and society. She must learn new way of life that opposite with her old ones. Abnegation was stiff and odd. And she had to choose which one of factions she wanna live in and how she managed herself to fit into the new one, how she managed herself to face the family she left. I think it's the beautiful from Divergent for me, Woodley could deliver the emotion. The flaws of the setting and plot can be covered by the way they building the character.I think it's a good book adaptation movies. Some of adaptations ruined the original book. But Burger picked a good point of the book to develop it into a movie. Which he chose to build the journey of Tris. Fans are worried about the age of Theo James, they are expecting 18 years old actor to get the role of Four. But i think James's maturity here helped much in developing the characteristic of Four. He could bring Four's trait exactly fit. Four looks mature and capable of handling things.The romance wasn't too cheesy, not like the other teenage romance.What Burger did, make this teen stories acceptable for adult audience. Even though, the plot and setting is kind of mess. But Burger and the team, so the actors, did, yeah, okay, in developing Divergent movie. For me it is a good book adaptation movie. I was surprise by the lead actress performance.I recommend you to watch, until the studio gets enough profit and pick the sequels. Because this one isn't kind of standalone movie. The mystery of the factions hasn't solved in the end of the movie, and i love to watch the other journey of Tris and Four, and how that world recover.","

The futuristic dystopian setting is hard to accept, and even if you do, it's difficult to understand the motivations of many of the characters in it.It is similar to many other ""young adult"" movies, and it probably hits its target audience better than it hits me. But, allowing for some plot holes and similar, I wish the setting had been more interesting and understandable. Maybe this will be more in focus in the later movies? Why the society looks like it does? It is never really awful, though. If you manage to go along with the premise, the movie is easy to swallow.

"Divergent","Amari-Sali","21 March 2014","Trigger Warning(s): Violence against women & short scene showing attempted rapeLet me first state I did not read the books and what first drew me to this film was Zoe Kravitz being in it, but after seeing The Spectacular Now, having the reunited Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller in the film was quite the bonus. Add on Maggie Q, Mekhi Phifer, and Kate Winslet, you pretty much have one of the best casted YA book adaptations, which follow the a female lead.Characters & StoryIn an Oligarchy system, featuring limited social mobility, people are split between five factions, at least in the hub of Chicago. You are either a Erudite, the highly intelligent; Amity, the farmers; the Canter, the white collar justice system; the Dauntless, the soldiers and police; the Abnegation, the social workers and government; or you are the faction less. In their world there is no in-between. Faction over blood, so if you decide to change factions from your family, there is a likely chance you may never see them again, and with the system as it is, leaving your family is almost portrayed as dishonor and disloyalty. However, there are those who want to break this system.Enter Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) who is our heroine. She is what is known as a Divergent, someone capable of fluidity between the characteristics of all the major factions, which is a problem for Ms. Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet). You see, Ms. Matthews, being the head of the Erudite clan, seemingly wants to seize power for just being part of the technological movement isn't enough. She believes the Erudite should run the government, so she decides to do two things: 1. Discredit the Abnegation faction by going after their leader and mounting support, and 2. Using the Dauntless, with their leader Max's (Mekhi Phifer) help, to commit genocide.All this leads Tris, Beatrice's new name after joining the Dauntless, on a journey which has her be tested in physical confrontation, mental abilities, and being left with very few things to fight for, but for what is left she seems willing to give her life for.PraiseNow, I don't mean to put down other YA adaption headed by women, but to me Tris was the first one which seemed human and real. Catniss seems so devoid and drained of emotion that it is like she is a robot whose AI hasn't been updated to emulate human emotions; and though I loved Beautiful Creatures, the heroine for that film seemed more so like she was made to fit some type of standard for the respectable woman. With Divergent though, Tris to me was a human character. She was written with flaws, fears, strengths and just enough of an awkwardness so that she doesn't become something worth rolling your eyes at. And I think the credit must go to Woodley. Though The Secret Life of the American Teenager made me write off any talent she could have had, her film choices have really allowed her to blossom. She has the capability of playing someone who is vulnerable, and seemingly meek on the outside, yet can have this fierce passion which even if she gets her ass whooped, there is still a fire which makes you want to root for her. Also, I must note that for a movie a little over two hours, I never felt like I was bored. Woodley's co-stars, and the Divergent universe is so interesting to the point the missing details bother you enough to want to pick up the book. And perhaps that is the biggest praise you can ever give in this day and age.CriticismHowever, and mind you some of this criticism is due to not reading the book, I do wonder why despite all the technological advances, even with the apocalypse, there are no telephones? I ask this because each faction is somewhat secluded, and I could not understand how these people cut themselves off from their families? I mean, young adult rebellion from what you grew up in makes sense, but to seemingly do it forever? I don't get it.But, perhaps my biggest issue is that it Divergent follows a lot of the usual standards for Young Adult adaptation to screen. And I won't spoil too much of it, but as you watch nothing really does feel like you can't guess the next move. I mean, as Tris goes through her trials you do wonder where her journey could go, but after a certain point you can see things are set in stone. However, perhaps my biggest issue is the fact they pair Tris with a love interest, and though said love interest doesn't have someone to compete with, at the same time I would love for a movie like this with a Hayao Miyazaki type way of showing friendship between the sexes, instead of always having it go toward a relationship being endgame.Overall: Worth SeeingTo me, this is better than The Hunger Games and so much easier to get into. Woodley seems very in her element, and between the action, the friendships, and the threat of domination, it is very satisfying. And though I doubt I will read the books, I will likely spoil everything for myself by checking the Wikipedia entry. So, with that said, go see it!","

From the beloved book by Veronica Roth, Hollywood has their grasp on this baby, diaper inside out. So how was it?I always wanted to see a 60s, 70s stylized sci-fi, Pink Floyd inspired. Unfortunately, the style nowadays settles with fake, eye-rolling & desensitizing teen material, separating young people's appreciation with good cinema for this. So where does Divergent fit in? Come on, where doesn't it? This is the epitome of modern-day, 3-week cinematic hit, & forgotten two star snore on a Sunday afternoon 2 years from release on Shaw. Yeah, the acting, the story, & the vision here is flat all around. These actors will get their fame & clinch a lifetime spotlight in Young People's magazine, & TMZ laughs. So it's another wretched teen blockbuster. The look of this dread, it's disgusting & destroys my palette. I believe a Juno-quirky teenage styled flick, fused with an intense sci-fi is an interesting conception. However, the game plan & execution results show. Now Imagine a Rainbow, Pull-n-peel licorice, if each peel was a different color & was pre-pealed, & each peal defined a film genre, you'd have the layout for Divergent. It's not free nor comfortable. To satisfy hormone-confused teens, they heavily coat it with held-back character interactions & motivations, never reaching or exploring above or below the norm. Maintaining teen-equilibrium content of an awkward nature, which in itself is awkward, with one somehow managing to free themselves & enjoy that in an unbelievably grand fantasy universe as it's backdrop. Tis unmixed, left to dry. Too afraid of doing or even trying. It remains a scattered vision not knowing what it is, forgetting what it is, & leaving asking the critic's swear word: why?There's a big twist. I read the book, & it is a rhythmically flowing experience filled with page-turning thrills and emotion. The film, which many passion-lacking productions exploit easily, breaks down the story to so many different visions, it's as if several directors manhandled the project. The story was compromised in the process. Nothing was clear nor soothing or enduring. Every 5 minutes I felt I needed to re-engage myself because the music went off the page too often to care.It is on the verge of a Broken Picture. Maybe that's the vision, a new revolution in cinema we are yet to settle with. Maybe this picture is ingenious in every way. You'll have to go see for yourself, if you dare to tread such sociopathic material. Be my follower, Diver.","

It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.","

You could say it reminds me of another movie not in my age group ""Twilight"".I don't think there is more worth saying about this movie. As a very avid movie watcher, it's def not worth watching. But for pure spectacle, it is still suggested for non avid movie people, and the younger audiences.Have a great day and thanks for reading.","

"Divergent","kermitkid","30 March 2020","Despite what most people think this is nothing like ""The Hunger Games."" Are there similarities? Yes, but there are also similarities to the Giver and I don't hear people calling plagiarism on that. While some of the dialogue is a bit cliche, and it felt like I'd seen some of the movie before, as a whole, I enjoyed it. They could have chosen a better actress for the main character, Tris, because at times it feels like Shailene Woodley is not delivering the dialogue as she should be. Sometimes she sounds bored, and sometimes she overacts, but Kate Winslet portraying the evil leader of their post-apocalyptic world saves it because she's almost as creepy as Donald Sutherland's portrayal of President Snow in the Hunger Games. I enjoyed the subtle bits of humor sprinkled throughout what is otherwise a dark film. The first hour or so was a bit slow, but the third act was great. I was really enthralled by Hans Zimmers' score, and the electronica music inserted here and there, even though it makes no sense to have it there. I have never read the books (and don't plan to because I want to be surprised) but still enjoyed the film. This is one YA novel film adaptation series I hope succeeds.

"Divergent","talisencrw","16 August 2016","I decided since this was my mother's 75th birthday to check out the first of the 'Divergent' series, since I love Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd, and Neil Burger's earlier 'Limitless' was intriguing and decent for recent sci-fi. Unfortunately the actors playing the main protagonists and the special effects were atrocious, the paper-thin plot was resoundingly predictable and I couldn't wait till it ended.Definitely one Burger that was way overdone.Of course Hollywood garbage like this produces a ton of sequels, while much better and original projects get kicked to the gutter It descended into a shoot-em-up, which must have made Republicans and the NRA happy. It's a half hour too long, given epic treatment when it deserves far less, and the dialogue's terrible, as if a high school student had written it. I'll pass on any sequels. And the poster's hilarious--Four transcends his fear of heights, just to get Tris' butt in his face. I hope for his sake she didn't have tacos for lunch.","

"Divergent","yoitsjaydee77","3 April 2014","Honestly when I first read Divergent, I was clinging onto the front of my chair and really excited when I heard that the movie was coming out. I was satisfied, but dissatisfied by the movie. SATISFIED: I was really satisfied with some of the scenes such as the zipline. Now the zipline was something I was angry and happy about. I thought just the journey through the ziplining was cool and the music was amazing. It was also really cool how in the initiation and they were eating, Max told all the initiates to rise and they picked them up and I thought that was really cool. I also liked how the Dauntless were always hooting and shouting when running and I pictured it exactly like that. I really liked the soundtrack. Kind of made it epic and cool in that sense. The ferris wheel scene was really cool too The action and the fighting scenes were amazing and intense.. a bit too long though. DISSATISFIED: Now back to the ziplining, the fact that the initiates just easily dragged Tris along was a bit confusing. Also the fact that Uriah is barely.. probably not even mentioned in the movie is just unbelievable. He becomes one of Tris' very good friends throughout the series. The love of Four and Tris seems VERY confusing and forced. The chemistry is very intense and sexy, but.. seriously. ""Are you kidding? What makes you think you can talk to me?"" like. in the book you were so nice and crap and now you're and asshole. cool Four real cool. And an asshole to an implied and questionable sex scene to immedietly saying ""I love you"" is just A BIT strange don't you think? This whole movie in general seems too rushed like. no. nonono. Like all the characters that were meant to be important were just brushed over. Al's death seems so unimportant, you don't even get to dive in who Will is making his death seem also not important as it should have been, Edward is not even mentioned which is strange because his hatred of Peter in the second book will not be well explained when it comes out like. That's the guy who stabs Edward in the freaking eye for goodness sakes. The scenes are all chronologically wrong. Especially the ""visiting day"", the capture the flag/ziplining scene, Tris to Caleb's visit, and omg so much more. Also what's with the Tris getting cut out and running back on the train part? And Eric saying ""Who let you out?"" And Tris saying ""Me""... Eric responding ""Okay""??? Like.. you're okay with someone riding along who you CLEARLY cut out? Seriously? And you don't do anything about it? I was expecting something like her getting literally thrown off the train. Also, the roles of the factionless were unexplained. They just seemed like helpless little hobos that you don't want to be with. They run jobs such as running the trains and cleaning up mess. And the jerkish hateable parts of Peter.. weren't present. He wasn't an asshole. He wasn't even an asshole. He was supposed to, but it seemed like he was trying to hard. I love Miles Teller, but he CANNOT play a bully.. it just doesn't work out like that.. And what's with the ""Hey Tris, that was pretty cool"" said by Molly? Molly and Tris are legit enemies. not friends. Also the determination of the initiates for surviving and ACTUALLY GETTING IN DAUNTLESS was brisked over as well as the dangers. The pit isn't even a pit. The chasm? What chasm? And what happened to the Dauntless girl who died from jumping off the train? That was supposed to symbolize that even the Dauntless aren't safe. Talking about cast.. the acting.. some of it was.. not. good.. like Al's line when throwing knives, the ""scared of being shot at by an airborn knife"" line was just said. not even acted. Tris gets shot running with Four at the end, but.. recovers? She runs perfectly after. If I got shot in the shoulder, I'd probably be crying the whole time. Like seriously.. How come Jeanine was so nice? like. isn't she a bitch? or supposed to be that is? ""Stop. Are you hurt?"" This was said by Jeanine when Tris was at the Erudite Compound to visit her brother. Is she even supposed to care? Also, in the book, when Tris goes to try to stop the sim, she finds Four ALONE IN THE ROOM CONTROLLING THE COMPUTERS. Okay. alone. controlling computers. no. He was being tested.. or so I think.. and he was with other Erudites and Jeanine who happened to be there. Oh and also. If you're going to put Jeanine there, at least kill her instead of knocking her down.. seriously.. How come Tris gets to grab the flag and not Christina? I thought that was supposed to be vital for their friendship, at least to Tris. And the fact that Tori was a bitch in the room taking the aptitude test was weird.There's actually more but.. you know :)","

"Divergent","raluotesanu","2 April 2014","It seems that all these new movies are about SF scenarios, the end of the world, mass destruction and so on. Divergent is a combination of The Hungers and Harry Potter with all the pickings for the right house or faction, whatever. The most idiotic part was the parents' death scene: cry like hell for the mother, don't even bother for the father. Overall, totally not impressed: uninteresting, not original, and extremely long . But I don't know what I expected actually. Maybe the books are interesting, who knows. After seeing the movie I won't read them.

"Divergent","agblum","21 March 2014","Divergent is a solid film. For those who read the book like me, it generally remains faithful and captures the spirit of the book well. Shailene Woodley shows great acting chops in the lead role. It's not a perfect film. Sometimes you wanted to see a bit more of the political backdrop going on while the main character is going through her personal journey. Unlike the Hunger Games Films (Of which I love those books - haven't read the 2nd and 3rd Divergent Books yet) thus far, with similar themes - the Movie doesn't peek into scenes beyond the Protagonist's prospective to add depth. But overall the film keeps you interested. 3 1/4 out of 4 Stars.","

"Divergent","mgruebel","13 October 2015","The film is not at all bad, if one takes it on its own terms: a fairytale disguised as young adult movie. It has all the ingredients: a surreal environment, moralism, odd characters (puss-in-boots, seven dwarfs anyone?). The message is the same dark message found in many fairy tales: You will grow up, the world is bad, and your parents will die.Shailene Woodley as ""Tris"" has to grow up fast when Kate Winslet, leader of the brainiacs in a quintipartite society that lives in the fenced-in ruins of Chicago after WW III, decides it's time for the smart guys to take over. Tris joins the ""Dauntless,"" the solider-faction that keeps the peace among brains, public servants, growers, and truth speakers (meet the press of the future?), not counting the homeless. As a ""Divergent"" who embodies elements of all five factions, Tris confronts the master plan, and in the process, she must face her worst fears, find love, and see her parents die as she loses the innocence of her childhood. In this fairy tale, Tris and her Divergent boyfriend are thus the only full humans, or real people. The viewer will identify more with some factions than with others, but of course we are all divergent, and so it is easy to identify with Tris.There are problems that keep this well-intentioned film from reaching higher. For one thing, the dystopia is so sad (like a particularly grim Brothers Grimm tale), that I would have rooted for the brains, had their plan not included killing a fifth of the population. That plan is not very brainy. Why not just inflict the mind-control potion on the public servants directly, instead of on the soldiers? No killing needed, more population to do the bidding of the brains. If I were a scientist, that's how I would have arranged things...but wait - I am a scientist!In a fairy tale, we must not dig too deep for logic. Instead, there is a well-paced story with sympathetic lead characters, villains who are bad but convinced of their own goodness (almost always true of real political villains), and the moral pontificating is fairly minimalistic. I found it quite watchable for 2 hours and 17 minutes, although it would have been better with about 25 minutes cut out. That's true for many overly long action movies nowadays - few can hold to the line like Besson's ""Taken"", a 90 minute fairy tale of princess in distress rescued by the king that's a good notch above this film because it is concise.Decently executed view-once coming-of-age story, like Hunger Games or Mazerunner.","

"Divergent","vistheindian","6 April 2014","Quickie Review:With the popular demand for young adult novel adaptations, comes yet another movie called Divergent. Tris (Shailene Woodley) learns that she is a Divergent, a threat to a post-apocalyptic society as she doesn't fit in its system. Now she must try to survive the witch-hunt for all Divergents. This movie is as generic as it gets for this genre: love interest, protagonist is special but that's not a good thing, training montages, and so on. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Woodley's character Tris. Beyond that there is not much else you will care about.Full Review:In a post-apocalyptic world, a society has been sustained in the ruins of Chicago. In this city the population is divided into five factions, where every citizen must fit into so they can fill a role of the society. The main protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley), finds herself to be a Divergent, someone who doesn't fit in any faction and therefore a threat to the system. Tris along with her mentor, Four (Theo James), must now find a way to put an end to a plot to hunt down every Divergent.Divergent is directed by Neil Burger, who has previously made The Illusionist, and Limitless, both movies which I quite enjoyed for doing something different. However, this movie fades into the noise of the young adult genre and does very little to differentiate itself from the generic clichés. As a result, this movie feels very lackluster and uninspired. The world created is intriguing at first, how the society is divided into factions to avoid conflict and war. Ironically this interesting idea also works against the whole movie, because all the characters are so cookie cutter and are exactly the same as everyone else in their faction. This may be intentionally done, but it leaves the audience with little care for anyone who is in peril on screen. The only characters that have any complexity is Tris and Four. So that's where I'll give some credit to the movie, the two central characters. Shailene Woodley is a great young actress in all the movies I've seen her in, and she is the best part of Divergent. She grows as a character and conveys her struggle between fitting in and being herself convincingly. Theo James, although not an incredible actor was at least layered and likable.Movies are an experience, and my experience watching this movie showed several red flags in Divergent beyond the ones I already mentioned. There were moments in the movie that were meant to be taken seriously but come off so melodramatic and awkward that I, including the rest of the audience in the cinema burst into laughter at its unintentional ridiculousness. Also the movie spent too much time on the training aspect of the movie, to the point I partially forgot what the conflict of the movie was. It only got to the real meat of the plot at the last 30mins of a 2hr 20min movie! There is one line that is uttered about the world outside of the fenced off city of Chicago. At the end of the movie, some of my friends and I agreed that we found that one line to be more interesting than the rest of the movie. That is not what a movie is supposed to make the audience feelAll in all, this is not a movie that is a must see. Perhaps the fans of the novel it's based on will enjoy this movie more than I did. Still I would not recommend spending your money to watch it in the cinema. If anything just wait for the DVD/Blu-ray release. It's a watchable movie because of Woodley's performance, and I appreciate the effort but I can't say I enjoyed it.","

"Divergent","hugorocksmy","21 March 2014","Even though this movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was a good start for the franchise. One of the best things about the movie was Shailene Woodley performance, she was excellent as Tris, and you could feel her every emotion in her face but mainly in her big beautiful eyes. And although it wasn't as very well showcased in the beginning, you could see it flowing out of her in the final third act. Moreover, the story felt kind of bland at times and as if it never reached its high point, which sincerely kind of came in the end multiple times, which led the ending to miss great opportunities to end ambiguously exciting. Therefore, it had an interesting premise, that can eventually become more interesting as the movies progress, but meanwhile this movie covered what probably any other franchise would've done in one. This never felt as good as Twilight or even The Hunger Games, and it might need to work more with its characters, because I found it hard to relate to any of them, but it isn't that far behind of any of the previous movies.","

Acting with eyebrows...it's one closeup of raised eyebrows followed by another. Oh, and lots of black outfits. Everything about it sucks from the over-acting to the dirge of a screenplay.

"Divergent","Stautis","14 April 2014","The thoughts going through my head during the majority of this movie was: ""Has this really been published as a book?"" and ""This seems like something I could write"". And I just don't tell myself that, it actually seems vaguely similar to something I wrote years ago on an exam. Welcome to a world where all the guys look strangely familiar and have forgettable names. Apparently there has been some sort of war that almost wiped out humanity. A small part of the population has however managed to seal Chicago off. The founding fathers of this society has clearly been reading up on dystopia and has come to a conclusion that Hunger Games is the way to go. Only smaller. This is all acted out where plot holes are blatantly overlooked and the identity of a character really isn't that big a deal.Suffering from a lot of vibes similar to that of the vastly inferior first Hunger Games movie. One can see a movie going for the same social commentary void of the core originality. The originality was also lacking, although not to the same degree, in the aforementioned film. This obviously isn't to much of a problem seeing as how it's really not THAT similar in the way the movie gets the message across, but there are very similar traits to this film and you can draw some lines that would be hard to credit for being original. As I haven't read the book i can't say if that's something to blame on the author of the book or the writers working on the screenplay. To me it seems like whoever was in charge of what was going on towards the end of the film got a bit sick of working on this. There are scenes in this movie where you may find the dialogue laughable or spine-tingling and cringeworhty. This goes for the story as well, when you're not able to tell where this movie is headed it takes a turn for the worse. However, don't worry, the guy next to me proved that predicting this movie from start to end isn't really an achievement. I'm not gonna say that the acting was terrible, but it had it's definitive weak moments. Towards the end, and I don't think this will surprise anyone, there is a crying scene. It may actually be one of the most annoying moments I've ever seen on the silver screen or on any screen for that matter. I could go on pointing everything that is wrong with this movie, but i won't. There are redeeming factors to this movie. I think the cinematography has some shining moments, maybe with a bitter aftertaste of pretentiousness. Anyone familiar with the musical works of Woodkid will know that his music has cinematic traits as a result of several years behind the camera, which I personally think is great. It really goes along well with this trendy and ""not-so-dark-dystopian"" world. Ultimately it seems like a mix of Equilibrium and, as i already have mentioned to the point where it becomes boring(much like the message of this movie) The Hunger Games. You take the mush, cover it in 100$ bills, add a relatable teenage identity crisis, some predictable romance and overthrowing of a government and you have yourself a hit, at least among the younger generation. Clearly though they haven't gotten it all wrong. My younger sister at the age of 16, seemed to think much better of this film. Hmmm... Go figure.","

Along with the played out story line and plot this film was filled with mediocre acting and tired character lines. After seeing this film I can now legitimately compare it to ""The Hunger Games"", since everyone else does. There really is no comparison. ""The Hunger Games"" is better. ""Divergent"" is really more like a knock off, I'm not trying to be cruel but that's kind of what it is, of course with some differences. In this film society is broken down into the brave, the peaceful, the intelligent, the selfless, and the honest, but a divergent is someone who's mind is versatile and can carry themselves in any lethal situation. The average person has at least two or more of these traits at the same time so I think almost everyone in that society would be a divergent. Because this film is almost like the ""The Hunger Games"" some people who enjoyed ""The Hunger Games"" will probably enjoy this one but in my opinion ""The Hunger Games"" is better.","

But in this movie, people seems dumber. People are forced to join five different factions, purportedly to promote peace. And once they decided which faction to join, they are not allowed to change. Why is that? No explanation is offered in the movie.Since it is known that some people belong to the divergent category (who are hunted and killed), and they can be revealed during the fear test, why isn't anyone else monitoring the test so the divergents can be caught immediately? There are many other stuff that doesn't make sense if you think about them. So to enjoy the movie, it's best not to think.","

"Divergent","falynsoul","22 March 2014","I think this franchise would be better served by being treated to a full budget HBO production 10-13 episode run. The world the books create is highly detailed, gritty, and chock full of emotional depth and events that are just not possible to represent well in a 2-3 hour film.That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film for what it did offer. The mental pictures I developed through reading the books were eerily similar to the ones in the movie. I tend to favor a movie's art style and atmosphere over acting/character development so I may be biased here. The post-apoc world was tastefully done, and didn't go overboard with blue glowing screens and lighting. The overall color tone is well balanced and natural, something that cannot be said for a lot of films that tend to feature over-saturated skies and light sources.Acting seemed solid to me. I tend to miss certain cues from the book, so if a character was acting differently than in the book, I probably didn't notice. The movie won't shock you or make you cry, but it did make me feel exhilarated at certain points. It was nice to not have unnecessary sex scenes for once. I'm not against sex in film at all, don't get me wrong. I just think the romance was done tastefully done.Overall, a solid release. (no pun intended)","

"Divergent","bkoganbing","27 September 2014","In a futuristic society the population is divided into castes based on aptitude tests. The names should give you an idea of what direction the people are led into. Erudite, Candor, Amity, Abegnation, and the warrior caste Dauntless. It's this caste that is the defender of the established order. Of course there's a lot of folks out there who are casteless, didn't make the grade in any caste and now are something along the lines of the Hindu untouchable. But the rarest of all are those people whose intelligence quotient is so high they can test into any category. They are called Divergent and the established order fears them because they can move chameleon like into any faction.Shailene Woodley is such a Divergent, but she's taught to mask it well. To the surprise of many she chooses Dauntless and goes into basic training for Dauntless far more rigorous for this Spartan group than the others. Woodley also discovers a plot to turn this warrior society into some kind of Fascistic tool and this is where the action truly starts.An interesting idea if not entirely carried out successfully testing for whatever virtues one possesses for your role in society. The great unwashed out there who don't fit in are accounted for. What seems to be missing here is an account for those bad character flaws just where do they go. I suspect they are the villains of the piece but a society as advanced as should test out those people as well.Woodley makes a nice and earnest lead supported by fellow Dauntless member Theo James a young man who sees what Dauntless is being subverted into. Also note Kate Winslet who is one of the subverters.Divergent is a nice if not entirely successful portrait of a futuristic society.","

Sure the factions don't make sense in a real society but I'm here for the story. The story is quite powerful of a girl struggling to make it through dauntless tests. Its story about overcoming. It inspires. The girl is weak at first but becomes one of the best. She is divergent and doesn't fit in. I didnt understand why they would kill divergents, just make them factionless instead. But still the movie is solid with gripping story and great acting. The lead actress is phenomenal. I don't know why some people would rate this below 5. They clearly don't know what a good movie is.

"Divergent","bbickley13-921-58664","22 March 2014","Another movie based on a bestselling novel. I think the first time I heard about this flick was when I went to see Beautiful Creatures, which is also based on a bestselling novel. I first herd of that movie when I went to see the Host, which if I'm not mistaken is also based on a bestselling novel. You get the idea. It's good to hear that young girls are reading novels.Though these movies are for young girls mostly, I do get a kick out of them. After all, most of them are centered on some super natural creatures or have a large Sci-Fi theme. This movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, which was visually awesome by the way. A War broke out about a 100 years ago, and In order to bring back order in a world fallen apart, the society sectioned off its people into 5 Fractions and when a child is old enough, they take a test to decided which fraction they actually belong too. Most people go back to the fractions they were born into with very few being chosen for a different Fraction, However in the case of the main character Beatrice, the test were not conclusive, meaning she would not fit into any Fraction. The people of this world refer to this as Divergent and being such is not good. The movie screams the message for young girls to grow up and be what they want to be, especially with the plot of Beatrice, who was born into a Fraction of mostly boring framers, choosing to join the fraction of really, really enthusiastic Law Enforcers. Although I can't help but to point out the similarities in this movie to The Hunger Games, and I must admit, though I find Beatrice who becomes Tris when she joins the Dauntless fraction, warmer than Katniss Everdeen, I realize if I have a Choice, I prefer my female protagonist tougher . There were way too many times in the movie that Tris' boy toy, Four, one of the leaders and trainers of the Dauntless, had to come to her rescue. In all fairness, this may have something to do with the fact that unlike most Super heroines that have been exploiting the big screen lately, Tris has no love triangle. She has 5 chooses to where her life will go, but only one choice in men. Maybe in the Sequel?The movie has a pretty well-known cast. Some people I knew by name like Miles Teller, who co-stared in the Spectacular Now, with Shailene Woodley, who played Tris. I felt a little sorry for the guy as he had a chance to grow in this movie outside of being type cast the sarcastic easy going best friend thing he's been doing in a lot of flicks, but it did not happen. Zoe Kravitz, who plays Tris BBF, taking after her father Lenny Kravitz, who is in the Hunger Games. Ashley Judd, who has a small but important role as Tris' mother and Naomi Watts who put on a little weight since the last time I've seen her, but still looks hot. Then their where a few faces that seem to float around the teen to young adult movies. The movie does a good job in appealing to a lot of people. Its starts as a dramatic film focusing greatly on the society these people live in, which I found unique in a movie of this caliber, but they give you a nice helping of action as well.It was a good choice for a movie to see, but I like hunger games better.","

It just seems to be a poor ripoff of the Hunger Games. It's a post war dare I say apocalyptic war time? In Chicago where people have to join factions to keep harmony and peace. If you can't fit in then you're factionless. You don't really get an idea about the war or really a full picture of who or why these factions are created. There are a lot of holes throughout this picture. You have to be tested to join one of these factions. There is just too much about this movie that is bad. The acting is weak, the writing, all of it.

"Divergent","t-reese1711","25 March 2014","I do not understand how anyone would expect this movie to be identical to the book. There are things that they have to do differently in the movie for certain reasons. Have you ever actually watched a movie based on a book that did everything like the book said? Of course not! To take words and bring them to life for readers on the silver screen means that things will be changed or taken away from because you just cant film some things to the T. For the most part they stayed very true to the book, with the exception of a few parts. I don't see what the big deal is. I read the book over five times and I was very impressed with the movie. When I first heard that Shailene Woodley had the role of Tris, I was worried, but she did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Veronica Roth seemed happy with the outcome and I think that's because she knew that they couldn't do everything exactly as she wrote it. Neil Burger did an amazing job directing because he made everything look real. It wasn't computerized or anything of that sort. I'm very proud of the cast and crew for creating a wonderful adaption of this book! Can't wait for Insurgent!","

"Divergent","TMAuthor23","6 January 2024","This movie, based on a series of books (does that sound familiar?) was released to middling reviews.When a movie franchise is left unfinished (the last book was never put on film) that should tell you something.The books are marginal, at best. They, and these films, were an attempt to coattail the Hunger Games books/films and the Twilight books/films.Shailene Woodley is not a strong actress. The one film she starred in that not only did well at the box office, but had a good platform for her acting range, was The Fault In Our Stars. It's pretty good, watch it.The films are littered with half formed ideas and plot lines, shaky effects and weak acting. Even those actors and actresses, who have been good in other things, are surprisingly (not surprisingly?) off their game in this slog. Save your time for something better: the Hunger Games films, Harry Potter, or better yet, something completely new.Hard pass.","

Veronica Roth pulled a Stephanie Myers (Twilight) when she had no part in helping make this movie. I am one of those people who want the movie to be just like the book and this movie was not like the book! Now I could go through the whole movie pointing out what was not in the book but i think i'll just do a few key components. First of all Edward did not get stabbed in the eye with a butter knife because of Peter. That was a really big part in the book! How could you cut that out?! And that was not how the movie was supposed to end! They were supposed to destroy the hard drive that contained the program that made all the Dautless act like robots....but they didn't! Guess what that means! It means the the other two movies will be ruined! I could say more by i'll just end by saying, the box office will not be getting my money for the next two movies.","

Two of the main characters are the soldiers who are also divergent, its almost as if soldiers are closest to divergents. Whereas all erudite are shown as evil, come on give me a break. Also the romantic angle looks completely unnatural and forced. The premise made one think it wold be all about this lady who does not fit in, however soon you have this lady not just fitting in but being a super human. She fails so many tasks and yet somehow manages to recover from all of them.","

The movie does actually make me think and is pretty smart in parts, especially the Tris vs Jeanine scene towards the end, despite it's predictability. To be honest, I rather enjoyed the movie until all the corny lovey-dovey scenes between Tris and Four; the movie minus the Tris and Four ""romantic"" parts would've raised the movie's stock in my book. Another thing that would've helped was to revise the completely lame ending, which doesn't quite make sense, is totally anti-climactic and is obviously screaming out: ""SEQUEL!"". Lastly,I was hoping there'd be some explanation as to why they had to live within the boundaries of the city, apart from Tris narrating at the beginning that there was a ""war"" - which I don't fully believe, so I hoped there'd be a twist ending, but it never came. Actually the more I think about it, the more I dislike it and the more critisicism i can think of. So in the end, yeah, I didn't like it.","

"Divergent","Badmoviessuck","3 December 2018","Divergent is a bland experience and they do not do anything new with the story they are telling.ORIGINALITY
This movie has a lack of originality.
Cause 80% of the movie is just Beatrice trying to not be under the line and we see her trying to succeed, that is her desire through out the movie.
They didn't use their time to try something new with the story to improve the experience.CHARACTERS
They didn't try to develop the side characters they choose their time to only focus on Beatrice, It's fine to let the side characters have little screen time but the movie would have been better if they made the side characters have a good amount of screen time and they manage to develop the characters.
Beatrice is this bland character who has no personality whatsoever.
For me it felt like that sometimes she was a bit shy and when the plot needed her to not be shy then she wasn't, when it came to her it felt like her personality was unclear and lacking.
And during the end of the her growing as a character was almost non existent.
She began as a trash fighter and then turned into a decent fighter that's the only growth you will get from her and we never get to see how she develops and becomes a decent fighter cause when she trained hard she was still trash at fighting and then magically she could fight decently cause it was convenient for the plot.
Beatrice is there for plot convenience.
Four is bland as hell.
I'll give them some props for managing to make him grow as a character that's the only good thing about him and that growth felt rushed and poorly executed.
He has more personality than Beatrice and we could clearly see those personality traits.
Four might be bland but he is still better than Beatrice.VILLAIN
The villain was bad she had a lack of screen time and if she had more screen time she would be a decent villain.
I understand her motive that they kill the Divergents cause they are scared of the unknown but i think it could have been developed more.VERDICT
This movie is an unoriginal wasted potential that people should not watch.","

I waited patiently for what had to be around 3 hours for the plot to pick up and get interesting. I checked my watch and alas only about 30 minutes had actually elapsed and to my further dismay the movie never did get interesting and the plot remained rather lack luster.I usually love movies set in a dystopia, but this one was on par with watching paint dry. The acting was average and that's being very generous. The action was weak. The plot was weaker. The romance forced. The characters were flat.Also try not to laugh when Tris yells ""stop it"" to the bad guys during a scene that isn't suppose to be funny yet you can't help but laugh at how ridiculous it is.

It is not as scientifically sophisticated as movies like Gattaca or Artificial Intelligence. And it's not as large scale as LOTR or Ben Hur. But it a really good flick.

Little did I know.The basic idea of the movie: We live in a post-war world, where people are divided into factions, based on virtues. As young adults, they got to chose which one they want to join. Surprise surprise, we find ""divergents"", people that don't fit into the system and are threatening its existence. They are chased and killed in a totalitarian system. Sounds familiar? I hope so, otherwise you have missed lots of movies in the last decades. The last one I have seen was ""Upside Down"", and it wasn't a great movie either, but it is so much better. And it has only a score of 6.4, I just really don't understand that.There's really not much to say about the movie itself. Lots of martial arts and gunfights, some kind of a love story, political intrigue. Characters without faces, intentions without sense, a movie without a justification for existence.","

Many people watch movies just because they have been adapted from great books but I don't believe a film should rely on a great novel. This movie is poorly executed and could have been so much better. There are striking similarities to 'The Hunger Games' but there is no comparison to how well 'The Hunger Games' has been made and the exceptional performance of 'Jennifer Lawrence'. In contrast 'Divergent', which also featured a futuristic society governed by a strict regime with numerous divisions, is not convincing and none of the characters are strong enough for the viewer to care about them. The movie seems to end up becoming a teenage romance tale and the climax is confusing and dull. Even the main theme of being a 'Divergent' is not explored or really explained, maybe this has been reserved for a sequel. However based on this movie, I definitely won't bother with any follow up movies.","

That's why every now and then a new Mtv-like teen actor who's interviews are like audiobooks of what their managers has given them to read pops up into the movie business.The formula is now known. A teen next door who is just so random and socially awkward and can't stand mainsteam fashions and activities is globally cherished as other teens crave for someone to relate to.However, that's not a new thing. In fact it's the same thing that macho men and dynamic women represented in the 90s as well as the 80s. The thing is that those actors, because of their Hollywood persona, actually had a personality. Now teen actors have nothing that would differentiate them from one another except their face. They are just mirrors for teens to put themselves on as they have no characteristic that would not match with any of their own.That's why we end with such talentless and without personality actors, and a script that supports such characters:""A common teen like any other (THAT COULD BE YOU!) finds him/herself in a situation of him/her being different of their peers(OMG THAT'S LIKE TOTALLY HOW I FEEL!) and achieve greatness being a non conformist in a world full of conformists."" sounds familiar?Please stop paying for such movies.

"Divergent","haosstoposto","4 August 2014","Another movie in the genre of Young Adult Fiction. I haven't read a book, because to be honest, most of these books are written around the same idea: rebellion of the youth coming of age against some form of totalitarian society (read: society of the adults). It is clear why these ideas are so appealing to the teenagers, it is in their nature to be rebellious. We also have obligatory love story, and that's it. Divergent did not blow me away with it's story, but it's far away from awful. The premise is interesting. In some unspecified future we see residents of post-apocalyptic Chicago living within five categories (factions) of people (Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave, and Erudite the intelligent), according to their character traits. But there are also the Divergent, people without faction, who live outside of society like Untouchlable caste in India. Each 16-year-old person must choose his/her faction and remain there for the rest of life. Our heroine chooses military faction (because they are soooo cool - and irritating) and we see her complete her combat training only to face great conspiracy between leaders of Dauntless and Erudite to seize the power for themselves. She manages to foil this plot and escapes with her friends. What happens now, we will see in an obligatory sequels. My main criticism is the portrayal of the Dauntless faction-army and police force of the city. They are shown as crazy, brave, tattooed, sexy youth and no wonder that they are so appealing to our heroine and young audience. They always run, jump, do dangerous stuff and so on. But even though one of the faction commanders says they train soldiers and not rebels, I wonder. They learn how to fight, of course, and most of the time they look like a bunch of brigands. They repeat the mantra faction before blood"", and not once in the movie I see their loyalty to the society they are bound to protect (against what, remains to be seen). Honestly, they look as coup d'état-in-waiting, but whatever. All in all, not great, not bad.","

I was wondering where the movie was going to stop and was pleased with the stopping point. I would have enjoyed the movie even if I had not read the book.The movie actually shows you more of the city that the story takes place in then the first book alluded to. I highly recommend this movie. It is a good one to see if you enjoyed The Hunger Games series. Plus having a woman displayed as strong, brave, bold, yet definitely has a tender side was well played by Woodley. I saw her in Descendants and she has a long career in the movies.

"Divergent","Isvind89","26 March 2014","I'm a huge fan of the books. The psychological angst and inner fight that Tris has to fight with and against. How she want, but cant, conform into the norm of society. How she, a little girl, is hated and despised for something she has no influence over. The books have so many layers of meaning that I sometimes marvel at it. Now to the movie. I tried to watch it as a movie, not a adaption, and think I did fairly well. Yet there are a few (or many) things that really bothered me. The lack of chemistry between the lead actors. The acting in general wasn't very good except for Kate Winslet and Shailene Woodley who delivered with what they got. Yet, I am marveled over how plan, dull and one dimensional the film was. I never felt anything about the inner struggle of Tris or the psychological terror that the environment is filled up with. Divergent is a inconsistent tale that some will enjoy for the same reasons they enjoy Twilight (which I still haven't figured out how one can). The only reason I'm giving it a 5 instead of a 4 is due to Winslet and her performance. Even though her character (that is one of the most complex and sophisticated antagonist I've ever read about)is made into the classical villain with megalomania.","

"Divergent","danielgyovai","23 July 2014","I didn't expect much but this movie still managed to underwhelm me. It doesn't contain a single original idea... None at all. Totally boring, predictable, dumb, and even the basic premise of the story is unconvincing to start with. This system with the 5 castes would not ensure any greater stability for society than the system we currently have. Even on a theoretical level, it would solve no problems and there is no logic behind it. They want people to rigidly adhere to a one-dimensional category (I'm smart, I'm considerate, I'm fierce, I'm honest, etc.) and they even assign castes for them but then they allow people to choose? You can't have democracy and dictatorship at once, you can't raise sheep but also urge them to have self-determination. So even the basic concept of the story is flawed, and no matter how good your structure is, if it isn't built on a good solid foundation, the whole thing will crumble. Take a look at the society in Brave New World, now that's hard to challenge, it's actually a very solid system even if it repulses us as we read.","

I knew she would not pick her home faction as her choice it was pretty f*****g obvious she would do that hahaha I thought the reaction of her parents was pretty f*****g funny too I had almost no sympathy for them for the entire movie their characters were rather pathetic really.We could all tell that Kate Winslets Character was going to be a villain towards the end of the movie and even her character sucked too, her motives and beliefs were very questionable and didn't really make any sense.When Tris meets Four it was very obvious that they were going to get it on later and their relationship seemed very rushed and actually pretty pointless.BUT WOW THIS MOVIE HAS ALMOST NOTHING ORIGINAL ABOUT IT!!!!------I saw everything coming, come on guys what the ****? What was the point of seeing this movie?? Why waste my time??? There was so much cringe worthy moments such as when Tris is fighting the soldiers (WHO HAVE EXTREME STORM TROOPER SYNDROME) and her mother and been shot and starts to die, the soldiers keeps shooting at the f*****g wall instead of moving in to kill her while Tris is going wwaaaaaahhhh all over her mother.Also what was so f*****g problematic of the existence of divergents? As far as I knew their only f*****g powers were in the dream simulator or whatever it was called and those weren't even special powers. Otherwise Divergents were pretty pointless.To finish this review up the script sucked, the acting was okay, the visuals were okay, plot was dumb and nothing special, characters were not really developed well.Do not watch this movie if you have any sense of what makes a good movie it really is a waste of your time.","

When I was a young adult and reading books that meant no sex, single plot lines, no swearing, and the complexities of daily living are ignored. It didn't mean that there was no plot and completely unbelievable situations.I tried, I really tried with this film, but after 30 minutes I gave up. If this is the sort of stuff young adults are reading now and this is what's considered good stuff, then let's destroy all books published in the last 20 years and start all over again.We're meant top believe that every teenager in Chicago, which has been shut off from the rest of the world, when they reach a certain age, has to choose their future career based on a drug-fuelled dream and that, once that career has been chosen, then they can never change that career. And there are only 5 careers open to them. Really? Really?!? Really! And this choice is to be made by these teenagers at a ceremony where they share blades, cut themselves on their palms and drop blood into a bowl. Really? Really! And if they want to join Dauntless - the soldiers and police - they need to have no brains, be all brawn, follow orders mindlessly, and be as reckless as possible. Really? Really! First act of the new Dauntless recruits? Jump on the non-stopping overhead trains, and then jump off a few minutes later onto the roof of a building (again whilst the train is in motion). Proof, if proof were needed, that Dauntless is full of idiots with a lot more luck than judgement.And that's just one of the 5 Factions.Yes, young adult fiction is less complex that adult fiction, but that doesn't mean brainless, it means simpler.I just couldn't switch off my higher brain functions watching this film and gave up before I felt my IQ start to ooze out of my nose, taking a permanent dive into single figures.If you really, really don't think at all when you're watching films, then you might be able to get through this one unscathed.

"Divergent","carrotbastard","29 April 2014","Goodness gravy gracious, I don't even know where to begin berating this train wreck of a film. I suppose I'll begin by criticizing the fact that the characters had little to no development whatsoever. I mean, good lord, characters that were hastily introduced during the first few minutes of the film and scarcely mentioned amid the film were hurriedly brought back with the intention of implementing those typical Hollywood cliché ""PLEASE DON'T DIE ON ME, PLEASE!"" scenes. I'm not insinuating that there is anything awry about designing characters to simply exist and complete the fictitious paradigm, but rather that the writers should be privy of the fact that the audience could care less if they die later on. The acting was also astoundingly mediocre. Even during the resolution of the film's primary conflict, you can discern an incredibly cringe inducing, spurious inflection in the antagonist's voice as she frustratedly reacts to her defeat with irritable overused phrases such as ""NO, WHY YOU."" This film also resorts to ""shocking"" or ""plot twist"" scenes roughly every five minutes. I've no antipathy for those personally, though, after the first 20 minutes of consistent ""OH NO"" moments, the audience becomes far too exhausted to care anymore.I direly wish these were all the caveats I had noticed while viewing this film, but, unfortunately, I could continue raving for an additional 5 unnecessarily long paragraphs if I direly wanted to. Alternatively, I'll conclude this review by sufficing to say that I would recommend this film to no one under any circumstances ever. It's nothing more than a try hard, egregious attempt at creating an edge-of-your-seat experience for the audience and is far more probable to leave them anticipating those enrapturing strings of text we call the credits.","

"Divergent","wakemeup36","3 September 2014","I used to be an avid movie watcher not too long ago. All sorts of movies: action, comedies, dramas, thrillers; you name it, I left no genre stone unturned. Unfortunately, it got to the point where every new movie I watched felt like a rehash of something I had seen before. I have been on a movie hiatus for about 4 years since then. I have still watched movies in this span of time but not as many as I used to. I do not observe them as carefully as I used to and don't consequently write reviews about them either. However, something about this movie awakened the critical beast within me. I have not seen such a plot less movie pretending to be deep in a long time and I need to write about it to feel like I didn't waste 2 hours of my life on nothing.What is this movie about, you may wonder? In a dystopian future, human beings are split into 5 factions. I don't remember the names of these factions and I won't bother to look them up. But basically, you have labourers, farmers, scientists, charity workers and the army. The charity workers also happen to be politicians and the scientists are jealous and want to be the politicians so they hatch an evil scheme to take over. Also, there are people who don't fit into factions and they are called 'divergent' (and are presumably talented at everything the other factions excel at), aka our main character Tris. The authorities don't like divergent very much because umm they couldn't think of a faction name for them I guess? Actually, the movie logic is that they can't be controlled. But why not? Just make a different faction for them and now you have them in line right? Oh well, let's just ignore that and take a leap of faith. The basic plot isn't anything I haven't seen before, and I've been out of touch with movies for the last few years. A lone teen/young adult in a dystopian rebelling against the really bad system that rejects them. Several movies have attempted this before, including Equilibrium, The Hunger Games etc. Does this movie do anything well enough for me to forget about the aforementioned fact? No, not really. The acting is bad, the music is annoying and the characters are terribly written.The acting is incredibly hammy. Sometimes the actors tend to overact while at other instances, they can't conjure up simple emotions. It gives the movie world a very dead feel to it. For example, a scene that is supposed to be rather dramatic towards the end of the movie has our main character bawling her eyes out like a maniac, while a similar 'tragedy' occurs a few minutes later and she doesn't bat an eye. The villain played by Kate Winslet is also emotionally dead and shows no acting range at all. Perhaps it's because English isn't my native language but I had a very difficult time making out the dialogue at times. The actors' speech felt very mumbled and incoherent.The music is very off balanced. Much of the time it overtakes the dialogue. Additionally, a lot of it isn't original music composed for the movie but popular radio songs instead which I always find a cop out when it comes to movie soundtracks. One of the scenes has knives being thrown around Tris by her instructor. It's supposed to be very intense and the music makes sure it tells us that by being very obnoxiously loud every time the instructor throws the knife. Similarly other scenes, particularly action scenes, have a very terrible use of music that distracts from the movie.The characters. Where do I even start? The main character, Tris, has to be one of the blandest characters since Bella from Twilight to be ever put on screen. She has absolutely no personality. Yes, she's 'Divergent', but what else? What does she like to eat, does she like animals, does she have any hobbies, does she like to screw around with her friends? The filmmakers made sure they don't address these questions at all, so we're left with nothing but a blank slate of a character. The other characters aren't any better in terms of development. The romance subplot is so forced, its borderline laughable. 'Hey, I touched you tattoo, let's have PG-13 intercourse now!' is the gist of the romance. The villain (Winslet) is pretty boring as well. 'I don't like human nature very much as it leads to violence so I'll use violence to destroy human nature' is her philosophy. None of the characters are interesting or have any sort of development throughout the story. The romantic interest is just a pretty face, the bad guy goons are well goons, and the main character's friends are just present as decoration pieces.Even after ignoring the unoriginal and silly plot, the movie doesn't offer anything that will make me want to look at it in a positive light. Weak characters, horrid music placement and cheesy acting clutter the movie throughout. How this had enough of a following to warrant a TV show, I will never know.","

"Divergent","a-williamson217","21 March 2014","I've never read the books, so i don't know how it compares to the movie yet, but here's my opinion: I think that it was too easy for the main characters. There was very little conflict, and not too many obstacles for the main characters to overcome. For instance; Tris is told that she's kicked out of the Dauntless group, yet 5 minutes later she follows the group and the very same person who kicks her out has nothing against it. Also, the 'limitless ammo', 'bad-shot bad guys' and 'one shot death' clichés just make the movie a whole lot worse. Also, there's no real explanation to anything. I don't know if they explain the Divergents' invulnerability to the serums and tests in the books, but all of that was completely unclear to me during the film. I have to say, at the end of the day, 5 might be a little bit nice on the critiquing chart, but i think it's appropriate for the amount of money and work put into the film.","

"Divergent","phd_travel","16 April 2014","The story is so much better than ""Hunger Games"" which I found sickeningly stupid. The more intelligent premise of Divergent is involving and you feel more for the characters. Even though the movie is long is moves a long and is well directed and well paced. The fight scenes aren't overdone which makes it convincing.The cast is likable and well cast like in Twilight. Shailene Woodley is actually good and sympathetic here seeming vulnerable and feisty at the same time. She isn't as beautiful as Lily Collins in Mortal Instruments but she is a very believable actress here. Theo James looks a bit older than her but they have good chemistry. Supporting cast is good too. Liked seeing Ashley Judd on the big screen again and she looks like she could be Shailene's mother. Maggie Q is quite a welcome presence too. Kate Winslet is suitably loathsome without overdoing it.Looking forward to the next installment.","

"Divergent","Hopstimop","23 July 2014","First of all this is way better, than ""The Hunger Games"" which is in my opinion a childish B-movie at best.Both movies suppose to be for young adults and both have a very similar story, but Divergent did it way better.Many people complain about clichés and a predictable plot, but they don't realize, that this is a movie for young adults.When I was young I loved such stories and I didn't see their clichés, because I didn't KNOW that those are clichés.You have to read many books and watch many movies to recognize standard things as cliché.There is nothing wrong with clichés. They make up our entire life. We learn from them as young adults.I am a 45 years old male and I enjoyed this movie as I would have enjoyed it in my teen years.It had no ups and downs or surprising twists, but it also didn't bore me for a second. I just liked to watch the protagonists going through their lives and the story being unfold.It is a solid movie with incredible visuals, sympathetic characters and a nice story.It has no explosions, but it is still better, than all transformers movies altogether (which are really really bad), so if you like nice movies with a little bit of message, which just let you forget your problems for two hours and just let you enjoy the mood, then watch it.If you like post-apocalyptic settings, even better!","

The movie itself is not a bad movie, but i am not in its target audience so i didn't enjoy it that much. The music was teenie, acting was average at best, plot was mostly predictable and very easy to follow. The story line is stupid...splitting everyone its factions, ya cause we all know that wont cause problems and power struggles. I never read the book, but the movie had major holes and it was almost hard to watch. There was minimal action and comedy and it was mostly about teenage problems:fitting in, hot ""bad guy"" guy and such and such...Unless you are a teenage trapped in a adult body, this movie is below average, but it could be worse.I've seen worse, but I've seen a whole lot better","

I think this film is also the most beautiful film in the entire DIVERGENT series.It is a typical SCI-FI film and that brings with it the necessary special effects. I think the color palette of the film is very dark, but that also ensures that you can fully empathize with the story. Only some things are slightly less visible on a large screen.Some things in the film can encourage young people to do stupid things, such as jumping on trains for example. I have no idea why this is being shown in schools, probably just for the hype.","

I thought this was a stand alone movie but checking IMDb they are making 2 3 and 4 in the same ilk as THG /facepalm.I also have another issue with the rating on this movie I have just read through loads and loads of user reviews on IMDb for this and there are 3 6's maybe 2 or 3 over 6 and hundreds of 3 or less scores but the score on IMDb is a 7.1????? how does that work???? 95% of the reviews for this movie are terrible and rate it really low but it's getting a 7.1???? Anyway it just shows how strong the teenage girl market is because this is squarely where this film is targeted. The rot set in with twilight then the hunger games jumped in behind and now this. Well I'm this is going to make a lot of rich studio execs even richer GUYS YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THAT YOU CAN SPEND STOP MAKING THIS CRAP!!!!","

"Divergent","mmaq63","24 March 2014","I'm a 19 year-old female and yes, I've read Divergent and am currently on the third book in the series. It is honestly one of my favorite book series'. With that said I'd like to say that I was wary about seeing this movie at first because I had heard some bad things about it, but I figured it couldn't be THAT bad. I was wrong. Before the opening credits had even finished, I knew I would be disappointed.1. I realize that it's hard for directors and writers to fit all of the events from the book into a 120-ish minute movie, but I just can't comprehend how they concluded that this would be the best way to execute the story. Key events were missing and/or changed. Many characters that play an important role in later books are completely cut from the movie, thus probably resulting in more plot/event changing in later movies. Basically a movie with the same name and some similar characters to Roth's book, but other than that, almost nothing in common.2. Watching the movie, it felt like the actors were trying too hard. The whole movie seemed quite superficial and all of the characters were unbelievable. They were saying their correct lines but it just didn't seem genuine at any point, probably because the writers were rushing to fit everything into the time limit. There were a lot of very cheesy moments that made me roll my eyes or cringe at how awkward they were. Four (Theo James) was probably the most believable character. And that's being generous. I suppose it's not the cast's' fault for being given what they had to work with.3. It was way too easy for the main characters. Tris gets kicked out of Dauntless, goes to the train and just is invited back in without a second thought. Then at the end Marcus just happens to know where the Erudite are controlling the simulation and when Tris and Four are trying to stop Jeanine there just HAPPENS to be a serum and injector right by Tris and Four?4. The movie seemed way too rushed. It was like the writers were trying to fit a whole story in so they wouldn't make book fans angry, which was completely pointless since half the story was changed anyways. Tris' mom and Will both die, Tris finds her dad and other surviving abnegation, Marcus knows where the Erudite are controlling the Dauntless and four of them randomly leave the other abnegation without any explanation to break into the Dauntless headquarters that they automatically find and stop Jeanine all in under 10 minutes. At least the directors found a way to squeeze it all in...? I can't even imagine what it would've been like seeing this movie without having read the book. Too many questions were left unanswered. I could barely keep up and I've read the book. So many important plot points or ideas were never touched or explained in the way the book does. We never get to actually become attached to any characters so by the time Tris' parents both die I couldn't bring myself to care. At the same time it felt painfully slow. When the movie finally gets to the ""good"" part (when the mind-controlled Dauntless invade Abnegation) I was more than ready to leave the theater and pondering what I'd be having for dinner.5.The relationship between Tris and Four did not seem real at all and felt forced. throughout most of the movie Four is being a complete asshole (more, in my opinion, than in the book.) to the point where it seems completely unlikely that he and Tris could ever be anything even close to friends and then all of a sudden he wants to let Tris inside his head, randomly kiss her, and then hold hands going off to battle before the finale scene were he and Tris exchange ""I love you""s. It happened way too fast for it to be a real relationship. This movie really made me appreciate the slow-churning romances in hunger games and even the vampire-werewolf love triangle movie that must-not-be-named.My advice is that if you're ever planning on reading the books (which I highly recommend) DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE FIRST. This confusing, rushed, unrealistic movie ""Based on the book series"" will probably discourage you from reading the books. Overall I really don't see how they are going to make a second movie anything like the second book. Hopefully they'll go the twilight/Hunger games route and get a new director for the second movie. Or maybe just forget they ever made the first.","

"Divergent","PlugInYourBrain","4 August 2014","Divergent is a pretty movie. The CGI of post-apocalyptic Chicago is very nice, but the plot has too many holes which keep breaking the suspension of disbelief. The underlying premise had potential but is not explored. Instead we spend most of the movie being bored in The Pit and screaming ""You Idiot!"" at the film's heroine.First, lets get the comparison to Hunger Games out of the way: Yes. Divergent is a rip-off of Hunger Games, but Hunger Games is itself a rip-off of Battle Royale. At least Hunger Games is entertaining. Divergent is kind of dull.Divergent is YA fiction. I'm not it's target audience. Perhaps that is why Shailene Woodley's Tris doesn't do it for me. I don't identify with her character, and she does so many stupid things I can't root for her either. I know she can act, but her performance here is flat. Tris is a whiny teen. Worse, a whiny teen who kept on doing stupid things. When a terrified Tori (Maggie Q) tells her to shut up about being divergent, she doesn't take the hint. When Kate Winslet's Jeanine told her she knew her tests results, instead of bluffing she blurts out 'You know I'm divergent? Wow! I am so dead!' (Not her exact words, but close...) And when she fights, she doesn't fight back and gets K.O.ed. The movie is filled with moments like this which had me screaming ""You idiot!"" The faction system is criticized as unworkable but that's okay because it's a valid premise that hundred year-old oligarchs dreamed up a political system that doesn't work and it takes a while for that to be recognized. But its problems are immediately obvious to the viewer. Any system which divides people into factions, each with different privileges, is bound to cause envy. There's open tension between the groups. We see a Candor (lawyer) openly accusing Abnegation (cleric politician) of stealing. Erudite's (intelligstia's) campaign to overthrow Abnegation is well known. If it's a perfect society, why do they need Dauntless (paramilitary) to keep the peace or candor (lawyers) to resolve disputes? And what about the large numbers of factionless living like the homeless, instead of moving into the many abandoned buildings around the city? And any American who sees that only one faction has the right to bears arms will raise an eyebrow. And who does the cleaning and chauffeuring?These problems supposedly are in the source material, but the movies writers should have patched those up.Too much of the movie is spent in ""The Pit"" of the Dauntless faction. When we first saw Dauntless they looked like an interesting crowd: happy paramilitaries who jump, leap and somersault and are generally in a good mood. If utopia must have a police force, these would be a good choice. But once we get inside, they're just another soulless army.Now if Dauntless had been the jumping, leaping, somersaulting Stomp-boys we saw at the beginning, Tris' journey could have made an interesting story.In boot camp there are five guys who looked so similar I couldn't tell them apart.The on-screen action is poorly directed. Teenage girls might not pick this up, but the teenage boys raised on first-person shooter games forced to watch this movie with them will: Gun battles consist of standing in the open and shooting. No teamwork or cover. Tris' Mom comes to get her alone: rookie mistake. And when her Dad attacks some bad guys instead of using cover, he walks to them shooting and gets shot himself. That's not a noble death. When you're only five and they're hundreds, fighting by attrition is stupid. And even though her Mom is supposedly a crack ex-Dauntless soldier, she also fights and dies stupid. When Tris flees, she hides with her back to a glass door facing the street. Imagine every gamer in the audience by reflex hitting the imaginary fire button on their cinema seat...Particularly grating is one action scene where a drugged fellow recruit stumbles towards her shooting... Tris keeps calling for him to stop, and he keeps shooting... and missing at point blank. Eventually she shoots him. But really, she should be dead. This is really bad direction from Neil Burger who bought us the fantastic ""Limitless."" (What happened, man?) Most grating of all are the end scenes. While the Dauntless prepare to execute the Abnegation faction Holocaust-style, Tris keeps looking around like a wide-eyed idiot. And then having beaten the Erudites, instead of pushing the advantage, she turns tail and runs. When Jeanine wakes up she'll finish what she started. And if the Dauntless infantry would now refuse that order, why leave now and give the Dauntless leadership the opportunity to reassert control?It was the biggest of all the plot holes, and it's these which killed this movie.I liked Theo James as Four, but Shailene Woodley just wasn't right for the role. The film's production poster, emphasizing her butt, is unintentionally comical.The plot holes could have been fixed, if the movie producers had been brave enough to ""diverge"" from the book. But for unfathomable reasons the book series is popular. Why mess with a working formula? They made a dumb movie from a dumb book. Sequels are assured. They will make a lot of money out of this. The studios got their wish. The fans got their wish. And the rest of us will watch it anyway, just to see how it ends.The soundtrack is VH1 weak. Hans Zimmer is ""Executive Composer,"" whatever that means.The romance is cheesy and not convincing.The real crime here is with a better director, better screen writers and better casting, this could have been a classic.","

I know this is fiction but the story sounds plain stupid. People are split into factions? Its as if everybody's brain went through some mutation and they lost their human nature itself. Don't care how it is explained in the book, but its not explained in the movie at all. Very bad story, average acting, full of clichés, very slow.Even if the books are not as bad as the movie, the adaptation totally failed. Lord of the Rings was made out of a book.

"Divergent","isabelle-frater","3 August 2014","I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch this movie. The book is on my ""never read"" list, mostly because I heard it has a lot of romance in it with insta-love, which I can't abide. I was afraid that the movie would be like that as well. However, I have had a movie change my mind about reading the book, twice actually. Therefore, I decided to give this one a shot.I've heard the story compared to The Hunger Games more times than I can remember. Funny thing was that it reminded me of a whole lot of other dystopian novels, and even some non-dystopian ones, but not The Hunger Games. The factions remind me more of the houses in Harry Potter. Especially because the houses seemed to stay with them even after they left them. The difference is that Hufflepuff is divided up into three aspects of the Hufflepuff mentality, which in a way doesn't make sense, but it does if you think in the terms of jobs. The only people we're missing are the Slytherins. The problem with factions and houses is that no one fits only into one category. You may be more like one, you may want to be more like one, but no one can be defined by just one trait. Houses have been criticized because of this, but people eventually leave school, though the house they were in remain as a part of their identity. Factions you can't leave, therefore they are worse.The world building really doesn't make sense in some ways. I'm not sure if it's better explained in the books, but there are definite holes. So my questions within the first 10 minutes of the movie were:What is the wall for? - What is the rest of the world like, and why isn't anyone trying to find out? - Why are there still so many houses with holes in them? Shouldn't they have been repaired by now or torn down? - How long ago was this war thing, and what are the general facts about it? - What are the Gryffindors, sorry, Dauntless protecting people from? It feels more like they're trying to control the people who like to climb on walls for no apparent reason, and don't know that there are mountains in the world. - Later, one thing that I didn't get in the last 40 minutes of the movie was Tris' mother. Was it better explained in the books? The movie made no sense.The beginning was actually quite good. While the world wasn't established well, the personality and life of Tris was. Then it got boring really fast. The whole training, the drug induced illusions reminded me of Ender's Game. I was equally bored there as well. Good thing that this time I had cooking lunch to occupy the 90% of my mind the movie wasn't engaging. Things only started to pick up an hour and a half into the movie. Some aspects also reminded me of 1984. While the threat from outside wasn't specific, it's not unlike the war in 1984, which I always thought didn't actually exist. Also the whole drug thing, that I won't spoil further.The ending itself was kind of anti-climatic and annoying. I am half tempted to pick up the second book just to see where they go from here, but I was so bored for most of the movie, the jury is still out on that.I almost forgot to write about the actors and the characters. That in itself speaks volumes. While Tris was well established, I didn't find her someone I could cheer on. I'm not sure if it was the actress, or just the character. Shailene Woodley I've never seen in a movie before, therefore I would not be able to judge her acting. However, as Tris she just didn't feel much engaged in the whole story. It felt more like she was stumbling from one event to the other. Her smiles felt lukewarm. Kind of like Kristen Stewart, which is not a good thing. However, it could just have been a bad director, or the story itself. I would need to see her in other things as well to see if I like her as an actress. Theo James is hot for sure. If he was my instructor I would have wanted to get into his pants too. But love? I didn't feel the love connection between the characters. I generally don't like mushy romance, but a bit of building up would have been nice. The character of Four didn't feel well-rounded either. He was more like the convenient guy that can be the love interest.Are the books coming off my ""never read"" list? Not sure at this point. I may find my curious nature not being able to let go of wanting to know how this thing ends. This is partly why I tend to go for finished series. I hate waiting. The movie itself gets two stars for interesting beginning, boring long middle, kind of picking up ending.","

"Divergent","clement-959-542917","27 March 2014","If it were not for the few action scenes and the obvious will for the unknown part of the cast to finally break trough in Hollywood, this rating would have easily been a 2.Divergent has been the online hype for the past six months, and there is honestly nothing that stands up to whatever buzz it has created. It is a demoralizing vulgarization of master pieces like 'A Brave New World'. Except it has been very unfortunately mixed with 'Twilight', 'The Hunger Games', and that it now lies somewhere between bad and worst.To think that experienced and successful actresses like Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd signed in to co-star with a whole bunch of TV stars - mostly big screen wannabees - on the basis of such a terrible scenario is pretty self-explanatory in itself: Divergent has only one objective, and that is to create a cash cow like the other recent teenage franchises.It could be called sad, but in the end, there is nothing wrong with doing money. The only problem nowadays is that poor writers just loot their plots from inspiring master pieces from the past. With Divergent, Hollywood keeps on being Culture's Tomb Raider.Actually, it is sad.","

"Divergent","ace_nair","4 August 2014","Divergent is a science-fiction dystopian action film and the first in a ""trilogy"" series of 4 movies. I seriously don't understand why the 3rd story has to be made as Part 1 and 2. This knocking off of the final adventure of Harry Potter by The Hunger Games and now this is a lame attempt to stretch a story to make money. Anyways, on to the movie. Spoilers alert! In the distant or not-so-distant future (I couldn't understand from the movie the year it was set) in Chicago, society has been divided into 5 factions depending on a person's particular trait -Selfless, Peaceful, Honest, Brave, and intelligent. At the age of 16, a youth undergoes a test to determine if s/he would continue in their born-into faction or are they better suited to another. Also, a person can choose another faction s/he deems themselves to be more aligned to.The protagonist of this movie marvel is Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) a selfless tribe member, who discovers that she has multiple traits and therefore a ""Divergent"". She however chooses to join the ""brave"" ones. The movie then moves to testing her mental and physical character for her tribe and how she climbs up the ladder.In a later mental simulation game, her divergent abilities are discovered by one of the training leaders named Four (yeah, four) but he has the hots for her and advises he to think like their tribe members. Ah, almost forgot Beatrice is now Tris. Then you have the usual ""one group is trying to take over the other"" and only someone who has just been trained can save the day. A lot of confusion and mayhem follows and after 48 hours I don't really remember what happened except that I woke up.Theo James as 'Four' is so wooden, Kate Winslet should have used him in Titanic to rescue Jack and Rose from the icy waters. Ashley Judd, Ray Stevenson, Tony Goldwyn, Kate Winslet, Jai Courtney and Maggie Q add to a nice cast, but they hardly have any major impact with the viewer. My guess is Judd and Goldwyn (likable actors) were present so that their deaths could mean something to the viewer as we clearly know they will die and don't care one way or the other.Overall, the movie looked very muddled to me and I wonder if the sequel, Insurgent, will be any better as they are trying to release the movie in a year's time without having a proper script and director ready. As of writing this review, the sequel doesn't even have a Wikipedia page. So go figure.My rating for this movie is 5 on 10 It was nice to see Ashley Judd on the big screen, even though very fleetingly.","

The story takes place in Chicago in the not-too-distant future- I don't remember them mentioning a specific date. The world is divided into five factions,based on their personality traits. Abnegation is for selfless people that do anything for anybody, without expecting a reward-think boy scouts. Dauntless is a warrior clan that police the city when they are not thrill seeking by jumping off buildings and moving trains. Erudite is the really smart people. Candor is the totally honest people that never lie-great politicians. Amity is the pacifist people-think latter day hippies. When kids reach a certain age, they are tested to see which faction they will become a member of. Shailene plays a young girl that has to pick her future path, and like lots of teenagers, she just can not decide. She doesn't fit into any one faction and when that happens, you are called Divergent. But, being Divergent is highly frowned upon-it can get you banished or even killed-so Shailene keeps it to herself and joins the Dauntless. Theo is her trainer, and maybe future love interest? Ashley plays her mother. Zoe is a fellow recruit and Kate is the leader of the Erudite. FYI: At my theater-AMC- they were passing out little bracelets with the five different factions printed on them-I even had a women offer to buy mine from me before the movie started so that she could give it to her granddaughter. I kept it. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and sexuality-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 19 minutes. I have never read the books but I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu- Ray.","

"Divergent","facorread","26 August 2014","A faction system makes this film look like an role-playing game. People in it are one-dimensional, boring, and all undeveloped. The film focuses on Dauntless faction, whose members are presumably the only ones in the society who are capable to handle weapons, engage in combat, jump, board moving trains, and do other irrelevant stunts. Dramatic music is the cue to the viewer that this faction is the cool posse to aspire to, and the other factions don't matter.In this scenario, the title ""Divergent"" leaves no space to spoilers: Girl doesn't know what faction to choose, but obviously she will not choose the same faction as her parents. Her aptitude tests are inconclusive, she applies to Cool Faction Dauntless, she competes for a position in it, and guess what? she earns a position. You know that even before she makes her first appearance on screen. Here is the big non-spoiler: after a while, the ""Divergence"" causes something that shakes the foundation of society and the very factions system.What is this film trying to achieve? It's not a visual experience, not a dramatic experience, not a political statement, not a comedy, not a sports film, not a sci-fi film, not a film for young adults, and definitely not an action film. Some people could be easily fooled by this film trying to be all of that, but the end result is a predictable, boring film, devoid of any credibility or chemistry.The film tries to explore personal identity through a system of factions. Nice try. It ends up conveying the message that if you like sports and combat, then you should not go to university, because they are mutually exclusive. If you are generous and caring for people, then you are a coward and cannot be part of the armed forces because these are mutually exclusive. Even if that was true in real life, the film is also an indication that factions do not need each other to survive. These premises are so stupid that producers are tacitly shamed into leaving the faction system unused and irrelevant.The film also tries to explore the value of choices, but guess what: the central character makes random choices without any motivation and without assuming any consequence of her actions. It's apparent that the premise ""Faction before blood"" isn't part of the culture in the film, to the point that people wimps for their families after they chose to leave them out of free will.The most dangerous message in this film is: individualism is a threat to peace.","

The 5 classes are interesting because they make sense of society and how they developed. Yes, there could have been more background ( i had to look it up to continue seeing the 5 classes and what they meant ) and why doesn't she kill a lot of the bad people, i have no idea but kills a close friend instead.

"Divergent","kuuk3","4 April 2014","I love films set in the future, but this film had nothing futuristic about it. It may have well have been set in 1940 as thats the level of technology you see in this world.I have not read the book, but this film was boring. For over two hours your watching nameless kids go to school. But nothing happens! There are no student rivalries, no interesting characters that set them apart, no class clown. Every character was EXACTLY the same and none of them did anything unique or memorable.If there was a villain, i didn't see him or her in the 100 minutes i watched it before walking out. It was just a bunch of kids attending class! Even the teachers were kids. Adults don't even exist in this world for longer than a few seconds every half hour.No explanation was given about the war, the world, the wall. The class factions might have been benefited by a sixth faction called 'builders' that actually tried repairing all the buildings in that city. As it stood, there was no-one around to build or repair anything. The whole mystery about 'divergent' was barely touched in the time I watched it, and I had given up waiting for answers when I walked out. It lacked any likable and interesting characters, any resemblance of a plot other than completing high school, it lacked a villain or conflict of any kind. Story-telling 101 was ignored completely and the only thing that gave the rating an extra star was the cinematography and panoramic views of the destroyed city which impresses well for a few seconds, before being ruined by the characters getting in the way of the camera and blocking our view.","

"Divergent","sdr2017","11 May 2014","Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the Divergent Series. I am currently reading Insurgent. I was excited when Divergent became a movie. Since the book was amazing I had high expectations. Sadly my expectations were not met. They had skipped many important plot points throughout the film. A few examples are why Tobias is called Four, the back story of Tobias (which was only briefly mentioned in his fear landscape), when Tris is caught by Eric after going to the Erudite compound, Peter feeling up and degrading Tris's body when they try to push her off into the chasm, for capture the flag they originally use paint balls, Christina grabs the flag, Tobias originally is the only person in the control room and he was the one to shut it down, and many more. The ending left out a great deal of conversation between Caleb and Tobias. Peter and Molly are made to look less violent and extreme in the movie. There were not many fight scenes which was disappointing. They also did not add a lot of scenes where Tobias and Tris start being close. The movie made their romance so sudden. The book is definitely a 9.5/10 but the movie lacked and strayed from the book thus why I give it a 6/10.","

"Divergent","baberchik","27 June 2014","From the first 5 mins of this soap... I mean ""action movie"" I just could not help but think about Hunger Games, and from then on the mind as if tricked by one of these ""now you breathe manually"" jokes kept looking for just those parallels. The nearly identical puppy love, dystopian society, excessive for-show violence and a pyrrhic happy end make this teenage girl-oriented flick a girl movie. I expect most of the high ratings come either from girls, or old lonely women, or men who got some great ... lip service... after bringing their GFs along to watch this as a reward afterwards. I usually like the general setting (i.e. dystopian, post-apocalypse) but there's just so much hello- kitty-glitter-spice a cook can put in a dish, and here he dumped the whole shaker in. Also plagued with a kind of soundtrack that would either be found on a teen girl's iPod or in a female oriented ""erotica"" movie. Did I say this movie is oriented on teen girls by the way? I can not stress this enough obviously. Even the rivalry depicted amongst the characters... even that is literally a direct copy/rip off from hunger games!I really want 139 minutes of my life back, but I don't think Hollywood does refunds. So, to the concerned potential viewer out there, know this: I sacrificed part of my life on the altar of cinema viewership, quite selflessly I might add, so that you can avoid wasting your time on it.

"Divergent","rannynm","28 March 2014","Based on the wildly successful novel by Veronica Roth, ""Divergent"" tells the story of teens struggling to find their place in post-war Chicago. Society is separated by factions based on personality traits and virtues in attempts to keep the peace and encourage the population to participate equally in maintaining a functioning community. When a person turns 16, she takes a test to determine what faction best suits her characteristics to help her decide whether she should stay in her home faction or move elsewhere. Tris, played by Shailene Woodley, is a modest girl from Abnegation, but her entire life is turned upside down when the test reveals something about her she didn't know was possible. She is a Divergent, which means she does not fit into any category, therefore cannot be controlled and is a threat to the system. With the advice of an older faction member, she is warned not to tell a soul or her life will be at risk. Young Tris then decides to leave her home of Abnegation and transfer to Dauntless, a fiery group of individuals that show no fear and protect the people. There, she has to learn to fit in and test herself physically and mentally, all the while guarding a dark secret.I really like this film. I went into it not knowing anything about the book trilogy so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was pleased with the outcome. The visuals are interesting because even though this film is set in the future and it features some advanced technology, everything is kept quite simple looking. There are, however, some flaws with the visuals and effects because at times it is very apparent that green screen is in use. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible. It features a variety of artist that I really enjoy and I've already downloaded music from the film because it is something I actually listen to on a daily basis which isn't the case with me for most motion picture soundtracks. My favorite character is surprisingly not one of the leads, but a supporting role. I like the character Will, played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes, who is a boy Tris meets during her training in Dauntless. Will is a sweet, kind-hearted person who is always very supportive of Tris and her friend Christina, played by Zoe Kravitz. He is very level headed and is someone you can always count on. I had the pleasure of meeting Ben Lloyd-Hughes and I think he is perfect for the role of Will. The rest of the cast works very well together. Shailene Woodley does a great job portraying her emotions and showing Tris's character development. She goes through quite a lot over the course of the film and Shailene is really able to embody Tris and show how she transforms from a timid, modest Abnegation, to a fearless young woman who is not defined by anyone or anything. The only problem I have with the casting is that Four, played by Theo James, is supposed to be 18 in the book series. However in the film, he appears to be in his mid 20's, since Theo is 29 years old. He does a wonderful job playing his character, but it makes the romance between him and Tris really uncomfortable. My favorite scene in the film is when Tris and the rest of the new members of Dauntless are heading back from playing a capture the flag like war game. They each strap up to a high-speed full body zip line that goes rocketing through the empty city. I think this scene is visually appealing even though it is very short and has really no importance to the film. The CGI and landscape in this scene is just well done. Since I have not read this trilogy, I was a little let down with certain aspects of the film. In ""Divergent"" the film, the whole movie is mainly Tris training in Dauntless and it feels like the plot takes far too long to develop. The last 15-20 minutes of the film is where the action and the conflict begin to happen and then the movie is over. I found out that this is how the first book is written as well, but as someone who has very little prior knowledge of the series, it seems a bit odd. The second thing that threw me off was that it seems as if quite a bit of the dialogue is taken directly from the book. This is something that fans of the book will love since the films stays so true to the novel. However, from my point of view, a lot of the dialogue does not translate very well to the screen and appears a bit cheesy and forced at times. Like I said, this is really only an issue for me since I have not read the series nor was I a fan prior to watching the film. Overall, I was entertained despite these points. I recommend this film for ages 12 to 18 or for anyone who has read the novel. The movie gets a bit violent during training scenes and towards the end but is nothing too bad and if you've read the books you know what to expect. Overall I give Divergent 4 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining and I'm already eager for the next installment in the series. Plus I and all my friends that saw the film have been quoting the movie non-stop and making ""Divergent"" references in almost every conversation, so it clearly left its mark on us!

From what I had seen, it was one of those films that I didn't mind if I didn't get to see it right away. But my sister asked me to go see it so I did. Surprisingly I really liked this one. Coming from someone who didn't read the book and wasn't really wanting the see the movie, it's really not as bad as people say. I managed to sit through it for two hours and enjoy the whole thing. I also don't like how people bash things and fans of things just because they didn't like it and with people nowadays that's exactly what I've seen from reactions to this series. To the point where people were calling people that liked it ""stupid"", really let's grow up now. As for the film it's not a bad story, I actually enjoyed the plot and they seemed to explain the story well for a novel-to-film translation. They characters weren't nearly as poorly conceived as I thought they would be and the acting was actually good. The cinematography was great as well. The ending was OK, but it didn't feel as though it left any room for a sequel, at least I couldn't tell that there would be another just by the ending to the film itself. I'm actually hoping that this series gets the other two translated onto the big screen as well. I think I might be a fan of these now.","

"Divergent","a236570","23 March 2014","This book to movie adaptation wasn't terrible, especially if your only knowledge of Divergent was from the trailer. However, faithful readers of the book will be sorrily disappointed. The movie follows our young soon to be hero Beatrice Prior as she tries to decide which faction to choose to live in for the rest of her life. In her world, society is broken up into five factions: Abnegation, Erudite, Amity, Candor, and Dauntless. Once an individual turns 16, a test is administered that lets you know which faction you should choose. Beatrice ends up choosing Dauntless after being told her testing results were inconclusive because she's divergent, and that's the biggest problem I have with this movie.In the book, this information is conveyed with the utmost importance. Divergence is serious, deadly serious. If anyone were to find out her secret, Beatrice would be dead on the spot. In the movie however, the divergent reveal is casual in comparison. In fact, everyone seems to know that divergents are being hunted, and the leader of this man-hunt, who also happens to be the head of Erudite, Jeanine, is all over the Dauntless compound. In the book Erudite's shocking involvement isn't discovered until much later, which allows all the other clues laid throughout the book to fall into place. In the movie, it's a given.I can understand that some changes need to be made for book to movie adaptations, but the changes made here add nothing to the story. In fact, they greatly diminish it. There is no longer the constant threat of being discovered a divergent, because the severity of being a divergent is so down played. Erudite's betrayal to Abnegation isn't a real surprise the way it's laid out in the movie, and Beatrice's Dauntless training doesn't show the harshness, cut-throat, and violent way situations were handled.There are many other finer points to be made surrounding topics like Four and Beatrice's relationship, Beatrice's relationship with her family, and much more, but they're too long to list. All in all if you haven't read the book, the only drawback to this movie is its length, coming in at just under 3 hours. If you're a fan of the book however, prepare to be disappointed, as this is a greatly watered down version of Veronica Roth's thriller.","

"Divergent","NicholasWSnyder","10 April 2014","If you see this because of Shailene Woodley, you have chosen the wrong film. She's a better actor than this. You have to give her credit for stepping outside of her comfort zone, but she's not Jennifer Lawrence here. I believe she has the acting chops to get there, but this film might have been attempting too soon for her. The movie tries to do a lot. Too much. An adaption of a huge dystopian world, a social commentary on class structures, a coming-of-age ""I'm different than most people but that's OK""-type story, and a boot-camp movie. There are some moments that are done very confidently and others that are not. The confident moments are the feel-good little victories, the action set pieces are excellent, the combat, the special FX, dystopian Chicago is very cool, and some of the acting is very good. Although I will say, the casting is better than the acting. The writing and acting are probably the least confident elements to this filmAs with many sci-fi and fantasy movies, the directors often focus on the cool or epic before performance and character. Or there's just too many things to think about and too little time to shoot that you have no choice. Either way, these characters were not as deep as they could have been. But you want them to be and that's what was frustrating.Divergent also suffers from the classic case of adapting but forgetting the essence of the book. It wasn't quite sure what it was, where it lies, who it is, why it exists. It feels like a producer's movie - let's buy the rights to a book, throw some up-and-coming stars on-board, and market it like the Hunger Games sorta, but not fully. But in the producer's book, it was a minor success, as it is making money. So success there. At any rate, I love this genre and I love original stories and adaptations. I wanted this to be good, but it just doesn't go there. I'm glad it's doing OK because that means more original-ish content will continue to be made. And to Shailene Woodley, props for trying something new. But for now, stick to the Fault in Our Stars.","

Obviously based on the Hunger Games (factions, teenagers fighting) this film takes all the good aspects of that film and copies them very badly. The heroine, Tris is totally unbelievable. Unlike Katniss I couldn't see her winning a game of tiddlywinks let alone a knife fight. The evil government is a one dimensional stereotype that seems to exist in all this type of film and the inevitable romance between her and Four(??) might as well have been announced in the opening, it was so obvious. I will admit that the book is a thousand times more interesting than this drivel and the main reason it fails is because unlike Maze Runner, which has solid characters, and Hunger games, which has the brilliant Jennifer Lawrence, Divergent is just a mass of clichés and bland performances. Do yourself a favour and give this a miss.","

Besides, I am already hooked on Katniss. To use an old phrase, 'If you snooze, you lose.' And if there are future cinematographic plans for this couple, try something new and turn it into a TV show. I am sure, for kids, this story is fun and excitingand what child does not need another superhero? Of course, always ready to step-up, I want to help and make things better. So, what was missing in this battle of hopelessness against, 'The Man', 'The Collective', 'Lord Business'or whatever it was? Maybe a catchy tune? How about,'Everything is Awesome' – oops – already used in a similar flick. And that would also mean plastic Batman is out too? How about a unique plot? Really - why? This plot needs to be copied a thousand more times, just so we can say there is an even two-thousand similar movies wandering around. Oh and the main character is a girl - who is snatched away from her family - and thrown into an insurmountable situationand this time she doesn't even have her bow and arrow? How crappy is that? Oh booger – I did it again, I mixed Tris up with Katniss. And while I am on this soapboxdid 'Divergent Girl' have a cape on, I wasn't looking? You would have expected it since she's got them powerful, mysterious and fantastic abilities. You know what they are. Yes, they are called Divergence so you best remember that! Knowing that, she should have had a cape – and maybe a giant 'D' splashed across her chest (I know, I am going for realism herejust go with it.) OK – OK, I am being way too hard on this movie it was actually fun and pretty enjoyable. Once again – I did not read the book, so casting did a fantastic job, the storyline was accurate (I guess) and the acting was superb (maybe?). I sat through the entire movie without nodding off (I consider that an honest assessment of the entertainment value of a movie). Bottom linegood movie, and I was entertained.","

A lot of things about this movie made me unable to watch it any longer, mainly I just felt bored by the performances of the main characters. the main guy and girl I felt I had no interest to watch at all. When compared to other big movies at this time like smaug or Robocop, I found this does not even compare to those movies. This movie is about rebelling against a system put into place for whatever reason, but it sounds like an attempt to control and enforce subjugation, and a few people have the fore sight to attempt to break out, the idea itself is not too bad it's the way that the movie goes about to implement this idea, through dream scenarios where you attempt to react according to a dream, but give me a break. How can you actually believe your even in a dream in the first place? The movie wants you to attempt this is possible by injecting you with a needle, I just found that to be absolutely absurb and silly. This movie fails to teach anything it uses a lame character build up and pointless romance to enforce this and i'm not buying it. I recommend don't waste your time on this one , unless your really really bored and are easily impressed with lame fight sequences and a cheesy story that has no back story and no explanation to enforce how any of this could ever be feasible. bbbbooorinnnggg.","

"Divergent","caseymoviemania","29 March 2014","Riding on the phenomenally successful adaptations of the first two HUNGER GAMES movies, it's simply a matter of time before Veronica Roth's best-selling novel trilogy (Divergent, Insurgent and Allegiant) is finally riped for big screen adventure. Out of the gate this year is the highly-anticipated first movie in a trilogy, DIVERGENT, which already positioned as the next HUNGER GAMES.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Set in a dystopian Chicago where society is divided into five factions based on five different personalities: Erudite (smart), Candor (honest), Amity (peaceful), Dauntless (brave) and Abnegation (selfless). Those who doesn't fit to any of the five personalities are declared factionless and they are equivalent of homeless peoples.However, Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior (Shailene Woodley), who belongs to an Abnegation family with parents Natalie (Ashley Judd) and Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) and brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort), discovers that she is a Divergent after being tested by a tester named Tori (Maggie Q). Apparently Divergent is classified as someone who fit into more than one personality, and could not be discovered by anyone or risk terrible consequences.When the day has arrived for a new group of teens to choose their own factions, Beatrice picks Dauntless. After the choice has been made, she has to undergo an extensive training period to become a qualified brave warrior within given time period. If fail, she will be kicked out of the faction and becomes homeless. As the training takes place, she slowly becomes friends with one of her drill instructors named Four (Theo James) and eventually falls for each other. Then one day she learns about Erudite, led by Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), is planning to overthrow Abnegation, the humble faction which currently rules the government.THE GOOD STUFFThe cast here is overall solid, with Shailene Woodley being the particular standout. As Tris, she manages to handle her first leading role with her engaging and soulful performance. Equally good is Theo James, who brings an unexpected warmth beneath his cool-looking exterior. In fact, both he and Woodley display believable chemistry together as eventual lovers.As for the supporting actors, Jai Courtney is perfectly typecast as the no-nonsense Dauntless leader Eric, while Zoe Kravitz is likable as Tris' closest friend, Christina. Maggie Q, who plays compassionate tester Tori, manages to make full use of her limited screen time to give a worthwhile performance. Last but not least is Kate Winslet, in her rare villainous role as the power-hungry Jeanine Matthews. Although her role doesn't flesh out well, she remains plausible enough to pull off her role with her steely-eyed expression.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The engaging knife-throwing scene (which is heavily promoted in the internet) where Tris is daring enough to step in front of the knife boards and tries her best not to flinch when Four starts throwing knives at her.THE BAD STUFFAt 139 minutes, DIVERGENT suffers badly from glacial pacing while the story -- adapted by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor -- feels bland and noticeably lack of sheer urgency needed for this kind of dystopian-thriller genre. Then there's the drab vision of dystopian Chicago which feels like a cheap-looking, B-grade movie. Overall technical credits here are disappointingly mediocre, while all the action sequences here (from fistfights to extended shootouts during the climactic finale) falls flat on the surface. It doesn't help either when the action is mostly ruined by shaky camera-work.To top that off, it's a surprise that Neil Burger's previous directing credits, such as the magic-themed period drama THE ILLUSIONIST (2006) and mystery thriller LIMITLESS (2011), who has a knack for showing versatility when tackling different genres, seems to be clueless directing DIVERGENT. I was shocked to see his direction here is terribly pedestrian and dare I say, lifeless as well.FINAL WORDSOverall, DIVERGENT is a waste of opportunity and a weak start to a potentially exciting new movie franchise. Hopefully, the subsequent two sequels (INSURGENT and ALLEGIANT) will show some improvements in the future.","

"Divergent","Hhkimes","20 March 2014","I have never walked out of a movie so mad at the cast and writers of a movie in my life. Divergent is my favorite book and I hate to see the plot literally slaughtered as I observed at the Thursday night premier. I cannot believe this is the book I love so much. Entire chunks of the plots were missing- and not subtle ones either. Very KEY EVENTS ARE NO WHERE TO BE FOUNS WITHIN THIS FILM. it is a waste of time to go see it in theaters. If you must watch it, I suggest just going to redbox or another rental place when it comes time for the movie to be released. And I am not trying to be that negative person that leaves bad reviews on anything and everything. Usually it is very easy for me to find the good in something but not in this. The mood of the movie was entirely different than it was in the book which disturbed me. The relationship between Tris and Tobias is very different than it is in the book which was something I could not get over. Along with the fact that the ending was completely changed. So basically, they spent a year on this movie to get the title and some of the characters names right. And everything else is wrong.","

"Divergent","drfinchsince1977","2 February 2015","This movie was terrible. Now I'll admit I didn't have high hopes for it when I saw the trailer but it was TV so I figured what the hell, I'll try it. That was stupid of me. If you liked the sparkling vampires of Twilight you will probably like this snoozefest, but if you are like me, and not a 15 year old girl, take my advice and pass.It's a bad story that's poorly acted. There is no chemistry between the leads, and no connection with them to the audience. It's just hard to care about them. The plot is thin and easy to figure out in the first twenty minutes or so, and the twist, if it deserves that description, will catch no one by surprise. I actually feel a little dumber after watching this movie. I've also lost a little more faith in hollywoods ability to make original and entertaining movies. I see this movie was based on a book. I would hope the book isn't as bad as the movie. If so, whoever read the book and thought ""What a great book! This should be a movie!"" and actually followed through on that thought needs to find a new line of work. This ain't for you.","

"Divergent","evanlyn","6 April 2014","Divergent is about Tris Prior, a teenage girl portrayed by Shailene Woodley, who lives in a futuristic dystopia that has been divided into five groups. These so-called factions are based on five values, such as bravery and selflessness, and are supposed to maintain peace in the society. Teenagers have to decide in which faction they belong and Tris is struggling with this decision. This struggle is later explained as divergence and happens to be a threat to the peaceful system of five factions – and so they have to be removed. Fortunately, Tris chose the warrior-faction Dauntless and so she has learned a few tips and tricks to fight those who hunt divergents. During her initiating-process, Tris meets Four, a mysterious Dauntless-leader who also seems to know about divergence and helps her hiding it from those who want to eliminate them.Shailene Woodley really captivates Tris's personality and she is inspirational. She portrays the lead character as a not-so typical heroine of the story. Woodley's Tris is relatable and she struggles with problems that teenagers today also struggle with. For example, they struggle with questions such as: Who am I? Where do I belong? What do other people think of me? In Divergent, Tris tries to find answers to these very realistic questions in a fictional world. This means that Divergent is both entertaining and it sets a example for teenagers who struggle with the same things as Tris.Also, Theo James' Four is very surprising. He too, portrays the male lead as the not-so typical male lead. Four has a solid character and James is not afraid to show the guy's flaws and difficulties. I find this so refreshing in comparison to other teenage movies that have perfect and very much unrealistic male leads (Edward, you still there?).Divergent is really consistent in its suspense. Although I have read the book and I knew what was going to happen, I still sat on the edge of my chair. For example, when Eric hangs Christina over the chasm because she gave up in a fight, the suspense was really killing me. What I also liked about Divergent, is the soundtrack and again, it is really different from other adaptations, because it is not cheesy and it is not based on semi-popular R&B-kind of songs. The soundtrack is well composed and really fits the atmosphere and the setting of the film.Unlike many, many other young adult adaptations, the romance in Divergent is mature and realistic. It is not mature in the way that Tris and Four have a lot of sexual scenes (one kissing scene and a lot of lingering stares, actually) but their relationship is mature, because it is based on mutual respect and trust – like relationships should be.Then, what did I not like about Divergent? Call me a nitpicker, but think that adaptations should stay as true as possible to the book and although Divergent succeeded in this more than expected, I was kind of annoyed by the way the Abnegation were portrayed. They are supposed to be selfless and vanity is absolutely not done, so can someone please explain to me why Tris and her mother wear that much make-up?!I also think that Four's divergence should have been explained better, because it was not explained in the film, at all. I am a big fan of the book and I am pretty sure that Four was divergent, but after seeing the film, I am not sure anymore. Okay, Four does not respond to the simulation serums at the end of the film, like a divergent should, and he explains how Tris can hide her divergence, but Tris and Four never really talk about the fact that they are both divergent and this really got me confused. I can imagine that someone who has not read the book, could be very confused about this.Divergent's biggest disappointment is Peter: he is pure evil in the book, but in the film, he just seems like this scary bully that pulls a big mouth when he thinks he is being ignored. I was so disappointed in Peter's storyline, because the film has this amazing actor, Miles Teller, who could have portrayed Peter so much better. For example, in the book, Peter stabs a fellow-initiate in the eye with a butter knife because he was ranked above him. This really shows how far Peter would go to defend his ranking and that Tris really has to watch her back. Unfortunately, this whole butter-knife-plot-line is not in the film and so Peter is nothing more then your neighbor- bully and that is such a shame, because Teller could made Peter so much more.Divergent is original the ever-flourishing pool of young adult adaptations and sets itself apart, because of two incredibly strong leading actors, a relatable story and mature and realistic romance. It is, however, not a true adaptation, in my opinion. Little details make or break a story and in the case of Divergent, the filmmakers could have paid a bit more attention to the details and important plot-lines.","

"Divergent","capone666","1 August 2014","DivergentIn most dystopian scenarios the human race is divided into two groups: meat and not meat.However, the futuristic civilization in this sci-fi film is split into five.Abnegation (altruistic) from birth, Tris (Shailene Woodley) was raised in a post-apocalyptic Chicago.On her 16th birthday, she gets to decide if she would rather be Amity (passive), Erudite (academic), Candor (truthful) or Dauntless (fearless).While she chooses the latter, her State aptitude test revels she is all five, and thus Divergent.Meanwhile, the head of Erudite (Kate Winslet) is using mind-control on Dauntless soldiers to eradicate the Abnegation. Based on the popular YA novel, Divergent mimics others of its ilk in terms of it hierarchical society and puerile romance; however, it deviates from the pack when it comes to its higher caliber of acting and directing.Incidentally, allotment in any setting - apocalyptic or not - is usually by someone's race.

"Divergent","samishoward","23 March 2014","Go see Divergent. See it if you have read the book or if you haven't. But especially if you've read the book. As a fan of the book I really loved it, and the friends I saw it with who hadn't read it also enjoyed it.I really feel that the Neil Burger directed film did Veronica Roth's book justice. It just felt authentic in bringing that story world to life, from actually being shot in Chicago, to many of the actors doing their own stunts, to the fact that it was perfectly cast. The changes they did make from the source material only improved upon some quibbles I had with Roth's characterization and plotting as a first time author, and made sense cinematically. Fans can also rest easy, because Roth was a producer, so she had a big hand in shaping this film. Shailene Woodley was a great Tris. She is a great actress capable of conveying a wide range of emotions, and she totally embodies the toughness but relatability that is Tris. As a heroine, I found that she's a very good feminist role model for girls. She holds her own the way a male lead in an action movie is expected to, and she defies gender stereotypes. Theo James is Four. He exudes masculinity, mystery, and fierceness. He and Shailene played opposite each other very well, and their chemistry was palpable. So if you're a fan of The Hunger Games, action movies, or the Divergent book series, definitely go to see Divergent in theaters. It's an action packed thrill ride filled with great performances!","

There are some pretty comments in this section that will tell you exactly why.I had some vegetable rice and watermelon for dinner, and I literally vomited in my mouth through the entire picture. This movie is sooooooooo bad I woke up with herpes zoster.How can this movie have a better note than Cloud Atlas for example?.....Do the people that casts this roles don't see that these actors CAN'T ACT? Do they not see that they have no facial expressions what so ever. Has no one read the script before they started filming this crap? I wonder who invested money in this flick, seriously dudes, get your money back, hire an attorney or something, because your investment was thrown away on a D series movie.Finally the soundtrack of this movie is THE WORST SOUNDTRACK of all times. I really think they googled ""free soundtrack"" and downloaded the result from page 32.If decent people exist out there please rate this movie with 1 star, and lets not allow flicks like this to pose as amazing movies.","

"Divergent","tegan-rayne23","4 July 2014","I am normally a movie person, but the book to this changed my mind. I couldn't put it down, I found myself getting lost in the story as if it was happening around me. I half wanted to see the movie and half did not, because I knew it would not be exactly the same as book. I was hoping that there wouldn't be a lot of significant changes to the story line. I felt that the casting was not thought out, a 30 year old Theo James playing an 18 year old, who is in a relationship with 22 year old Shailene playing an 18 year old Tris. Just looking at the two you can see that there is a large age difference but what makes the casting worse is that they don't have any on-screen chemistry. Many parts of the book that I thought were important were left out, starting with parts like the Aptitude test. Tori had to alter the simulation to put Tris in the bus because of her actions in the first part of the simulation she had only ruled out Amity. In the movie, she only goes through the knife choice and dog simulation. If the full part was in the movie it would explain a lot more.Tori's attitude in the movie seems quite hostile where as the way that I read the scene was that she was concerned for Beatrice's wellbeing. Many scenes were completely different from the book. In the book during initiation there is a Family day where family members have the choice of visiting their children if they have transferred factions. In the movie this does not happen. Tris' mum sneaks in and speaks to her in secret. Through-out the movie Tris has to encounter Jeanine first at the choosing ceremony and then in the Dauntless compound, while she's walking through the halls and other times like when she is doing her final assessment. This does not happen in the book. Most of the movies attack simulation scenes differ from the book. When the Dauntless soldiers take Tris and Tobias to Jeanine in her office, they argue about the need to create a new serum to control the Divergent. Tobias lunges at Jeanine. The Dauntless soldiers stop Tobias while Jeanine injects him with the new serum. The new serum is created to manipulate minds, and it does, Tobias reaches for Tris and strangles her. After the guards separated them, Jeanine sends Tobias off to guard the control room and sends Tris for her execution. Tris wakes up in a glass tank, after being hit over the head, which is where her mum saves her from just before she drowns. In the movie they take the couple to Jeanine but it doesn't seem like they are in her office, more like a filing room. There is a struggle and Tobias does lunge at Jeanine but he Jeanine just says to the guards to bring Tobias with them and to get rid of Tris. Tris is taken outside and made to kneel, which is when her mum saves her. In the book when Tris gets to the control room she finds Tobias on his own. She battles him, it takes her a while but she realises that she needs to fight the simulation because she will not win against him. By surrendering to him something in his brain clicked and he could see Tris. They stop the simulation and remove the simulation data. In the movie Tris finds Tobias tied to a seat, watching the screens which show the attack on the city, Erudite walking around, Dauntless soldiers on guard. He had been injected with the new serum, so when Tris set him free he attacked her. This is when they begin to battle, she does come to the same conclusion as the book, but in the movie Jeanine is in the control room amongst the other Erudite. Once Tobias came out of his manipulated state, he and Tris fight the soldiers in the room together. Jeanine runs to the computers to make sure the simulation is running accordingly, and Tris throws her knife into Jeanine's hand pinning it to the computer. Tris demands that Jeanine stop the simulation, but Jeanine refused. Tris thinking as fast as she can to stop Jeanine, see's a syringe and a vile of the simulation serum. Tobias grabs it and chucks it to Tris, which she uses to inject Jeanine. Once injected, Tris ordered her to shut the simulation down, which she did. The book contained a lot of dialogue which haven't been transferred to the movie, which removes context. In the book Four shouts at Tris while he is throwing knives at her head, the dialogue is simple but effective. This frustrates Tris and makes her more determined. As everyone else leaves the room Four tries to ask if Tris is OK, but she just shouts at him about the taunting, he tries to hint to Tris that he is being tough on her because he cares for her. In the movie, there's not a lot of conversation. Four doesn't say much to Tris while doing this, but he does ask Eric a question. When everyone leaves, Tris yells at him but unlike the book Tobias turns the conversation around to say that Eric wouldn't have let him stop if he hadn't have hurt her. In the book when Peter is being beaten in the initiation rankings by Edward, Peter stabs Edward in the eye with a butter knife. In the movie there is no mention of this, which I think is a mistake because he returns in the next movie. I wish I could re-write, re-cast this entire movie so that it was more like the book.","

"Divergent","grahambthomson-761-860939","13 April 2014","Having saw the film yesterday, it not great, it is not good, it is average. Some will say it's better some will say it's worse. The story is a little unbelievable but is packed full of action and drama. The problem is the action isn't great, and the drama isn't that exciting. Even the props had a feel of low budget or just not enough thought had gone into them. The actors were not great. The male lead was increasingly wooden and just seemed unable to dominate the screen the way his character should. The female lead was at times very good but she just didn't do enough for it to be better than that. Kate Winslet was good also but she was not involve nearly enough.Even with some good performances the film seemed a bit dull and obvious. Divergent is an OK film it's just OK, and that is its biggest problem it is a very safe very middle of the road sci fi film.","

Maybe if I thought the ""Twilight"" franchise was the pinnacle of cinema, I would think more of this film. In an apparent attempt to be ""Hip"" with the kids, the writers insert an inexplicable scene with a big Zip Line run which adds nothing to the plot. This sojourn is just before they all get their first tattoos. At this point I was waiting for all the principles to start uploading ""selfies"" to their Facebook pages. You get the idea.

"Divergent","gaussgoat","23 March 2014","As a parent who has been taken into some fairly painful movies, I wasn't sure what to expect with Divergent. I absolutely loved Neil Burger's Limitless, so I was really hoping that he was going to not inflict too much pain on me here. Fortunately for me, and very happily for my daughter, Mr Burger has delivered a solid film that, while it doesn't shatter any expectations, does a nice job of bringing the material to life.Divergent's strongest elements are the wonderfully actualized setting of post-apocalyptic Chicago, and the strength of the varied cast, particularly our young leads. Woodley and James do admirable work as the Heroine and Hero of the film, and I think there is some legitimate chemistry between these two. Burger does a nice job of understating things early on, but showcasing a growing bond between the two as the film progresses.There are some truly great moments on screen throughout. Divergent could have been an utter bomb with the amount of personal soul-searching that goes on, but through an admirable combination of pacing, character development, and fine detailed world building, Divergent never gets too preachy for its own good.There are a few weak moments here and there. The film definitely has a bit of bad-guy monologuing, and you have to wonder where the hell the scene that defined some nefarious back room dealings was, particularly with the star power in this movie. Some exposition at the end is a little uninspiring, and some of the plot is not what one would call a twist.Rough spots aside, the great moments well outweigh the bad. The movie also really steers away from any kind of brutal violence of any kind, as this is easily one of the best PG-13 movies I could recommend for parents in ages. In addition, Woodley's Tris is a wonderful heroine for girls. Tough, complicated, smart, and she doesn't give up.Go ahead and take the family to this one, you won't be disappointed. It may not win best picture in 2014, but Divergent delivers where it needs to and is definitely entertaining.","

If you watch the trailer, it looks like a science fiction movie set in a dystopian future, where humans created an organized society to protect themselves against an unknown threat. I was hooked !I went to see the movie, and well. It's another Twilight, really. The pace is really slow, it all centers around an uninteresting love story, 100% predictable. The dystopian society don't make sense, and is pretty ridiculous : like hell people would live in 5 groups, mingle everyday, and be satisfied with the situation for 100 years.WARNING : SPOILER ALERT And come on, who says ""I don't want to go too fast"" after their first kiss ?Anyway, if you want a predictable movie, with cheesy dialog, really slow pace, boring love story and such, this movie is for you.I still rated it 3 stars, because to be honest, I laughed a lot trying to predict was what gonna happen next, and succeeding all the time.(Some people will probably say ""but, it's an adaptation from a book, so it's normal"", but then I'd replay : ""there are thousands of books around here that deserve a movie adaptation, why pick this one?""","

And then I went to theater to watch the movie. From the beginning, I have doubt about the cast. Based on the book, Tris' body should not be that big. And after the movie played, everything was falling into ashes. The casts are awful. I expect that peter would be someone who have an arrogant face, but instead.. Jainine, Kate winslet is an awful choice. Jainine should be played by Charlize Teron, or someone who have a typical face like that. And I felt that the casts are lack of chemistry. The story. Yeah I get it that it's impossible for a based-on-book-movie to have exactly same story like the book. I didn't expect that it would be this different. They ruined the whole story. Everything is changed. Its like I was watching a different movie with the same title. I came with some expectation that the movie wouldn't be as good as the book, because it always happened, but I shocked that they could for god's sake made it that awful.

"Divergent","muhammadalinajfi","19 March 2014","In my opinion, Divergent was fantastic and a must see-movie. Divergent is the most pure and honest movie based on a book I have ever seen. It does not remove almost any important scenes from the book and yet it still stitches the whole thing together to fit perfectly, and beautifully. It does this so well, that companions who haven't read the book still understand everything. It also made my friends want to read it; and though some of them did not want to start from the first book since they saw the movie, they started from the second and have not encountered parts which they did not understand. This is because the movie is so well made that they did not leave out anything in production, like most big production companies do. Divergent has action, adventure, romance, comedy, mystery, etc. It is the perfect movie to me. The actors are fantastic, and Shailene Woodley and Theo James rock the roles of Tris and Four in perfect unison. Divergent brings fans wildest imaginations to life, and flies the words of the book of it's pages.","

Divergent. I have not been this annoyed at a movie since...I guess Sucker Punch? 1. Most people would be ""Divergent"". a. Most people have multiple skills b. Most people have different thought processes (there are 16 outcomes on Myers-Briggs, not 5...and even 16 doesn't truly cover every person: and often people get different results at different times) c. Δperson/Δtime !=0 (people change) d. Additional reasons are an exercise for the reader 2. Drug touted to be little more than truth serum makes remote control people puppets. 3. ASSUMING most people were not divergent, there would be no reason not to want them. a. Divergents clearly are willing to follow the rules of society - their multiple talents do not prevent them from accepting this path. b. Divergents bring unique skillsets to their particular jobs that would otherwise be unavailable to a given Faction. c. etc. 4. Assuming most people were not divergent, what could have caused such a dramatic psychological shift? I _really wanted to like this movie, it was perfect in many ways, but the core concept was so flawed I could only hate it. Syfy originals have more meat to them than this garbage.","

"Divergent","lostonthehighway","11 April 2021","Divergent is another one of those movies which is trying to be what the Hunger Games was. And whilst the Hunger Games was a profound commentary on the media's treatment of humanity and touched upon important themes in society such as capitalism and profit, this was pretty much a shiny, plotless mess.Please note that this review contains spoilers. Additionally, what I'm about to say largely applies to all three movies, but I'm just going to talk about this one because I can't really be bothered to write the same thing three times.Alongside many others like it like The Maze Runner, The Giver, Ender's Game, Neuromancer, Gone, I am Number Four and Uglies (and their respective series & equally doomed movie adaptations, most of which I myself read and watched in their entirety as a pre-teen along with this), Divergent and its sequels was part of a literature movement dubbed as the YA dystopia boom. Most of the novels I mentioned above were pretty hit-or-miss (although the Giver will always have a special place in my heart for reasons I don't really have time to go into right now but you can read in my separate review), but the thing with Divergent is that it accidentally managed to spark the downfall of the entire YA dystopia genre.Right off the bat, you have what's pretty much the most ridiculous and pointless set-up imagined. Everyone apparently only has one personality trait, and having MORE THAN ONE PERSONALITY TRAIT made you tHe ChOsEn OnE. Wow, it's like Harry Potter crossed with the Matrix. Hell, I didn't get past halfway through the second book because I got so bored. You have the classic thing of Teenagers vs The Government™, and what's got to be the most boring, personality less protagonist who I've ever heard about (because she's GOT to be slightly determined, pretty and completely clueless so that all of our young female audience can relate since girls clearly don't have personalities).Unlike Katniss of THG, who had motivations and reasons to hate the government, who grew up in a difficult lifestyle, hunting because she was give no other choice, and who was repeatedly exploited for entertainment, Tris has, as I mentioned, no personality or motivations whatsoever apart from 'I hate my submissive family and those Dauntless guys are cool'. It's predictable, boring, has absolutely no romantic chemistry between Tris and Four, and nothing makes any sense.The reason I didn't rate this lower is that I did, at one point, love this series as well as everyone else in my school, and I've got to admit some of the action sequences are pretty cool. And it will retain my very generous 4/10 on a sentimental basis only.Anyway, don't watch this. Watch the Hunger Games instead.-Sasha.","

This could be another series we could look forward to"" and this would be like the other successful series that have past. But I do not think so.Me and my siblings have a lot of side comments while we are watching the movie. I know this is in a dystopian era and we don't actually get the movie until the half of it. We don't understand why there should be factions and this looked a lot like Hunger Games. The blood thingy, where they choose the faction where they are going to be, another familiar scene... like in Harry Potter The Dauntless faction... they say they are not rebels and such... and this ""Dauntless faction"" reminds us of the Fire Nation in the Last Airbender.I mean, it is easy to get tired of these kinds of movies because they are very common now.And, Tris and Four?? Why the hell did we kissed? I mean, they just kissed and the romance went on... I mean, how did it happened so fast? There seemed to have no development between them through the course of the movie. Four is like this bully-turned-mentor guy who helped Tris throughout her stay in the Dauntless faction. And that's just it, I think I would like to see them as just mentor-student as for now. They should've skipped the ""love story"" for the next installment.I liked the whole concept really, but I think it is just redundant. Like we've already seen and heard this kind of story.I am really intrigued with this story and wanted to read the whole book series... but after seeing this movie. I just don't think that I would want to read it anymore.","

"Divergent","dariana-ro","23 March 2014","Unlike the first Hunger Games this one managed to make me get emotionally involved . My major complain is that the other initiates are just invisible , no time was spent to develop those characters and their relationship with Tris. If the other books are made into movies this will be a problem because some of those people have important roles to play . I sow other people complain that there is no sense of urgency and that may make the movie a bore . I think that this is caused by the fact that they wanted to get a good rating so there is a lot less death, violence and injury in the movie then in the book . In the book kids fall jumping from the train and a boy is mutilated to get him out of the competition.I agree they could have done a better job showing the pressure the character has to endure but it wasn't boring. If she fails to be accepted in Dauntless she will be thrown out on the streets and on top of that her life is in danger since divergents are killed .","

I found the movie kept my attention from beginning to end, with some light moments, a bit of romance, and lots of excitement throughout. I'm a big Hunger Games fan and thought Divergent was every bit as good, and in some ways better.Based on our advice, my wife and 9-year old son went to see Divergent this weekend and both loved the movie equally as much.

My guess is they read the back of the book and thought that was good enough.How this made it to the theater like this is beyond me. They took out the visitation day and REPLACED IT with her mom sneaking into the Dauntless compound. Not only that, she never mentioned anything about going to visit Caleb or the serum. Little things that had a huge impact on these characters were missed. We never saw Peter stab Edward. Wait, did we even see Edward? Oh yes, we did for a brief moment during capture the flag. Speaking of capture the flag, according to the book I read Christina was the one who held the flag. Chances are you won't see me at the second or third movie if they make them.","

"Divergent","sarahxpiano97","6 May 2014","The movie was so bad. It was a good concept from the beginning, so on its own it may have seemed great to those who haven't read the book. If you have read the book, however, you would have noticed that more things were left out than kept in, things happened at way different times than originally, important and thrilling scenes where twisted resulting in unimportant and boring parts, and many characters, thoughts, and important phrases were almost completely left out. This is the first movie that I have ever despised. However, whether you believe the movie is good or bad, and you haven't read the book, please read it for your own good. It is honestly one of the best I have read. Things you missed in the movie: The hardcore ship you will have for Christina and Will and, obviously Tris and Tobias, so many intimate moments, the fact that Four is not called Four by Tris once she knows his name, how Molly, Peter, and Drew are complete and utter butt holes and you will want them dead as much as Tris does, and many more that I can't list because of the word limit. Honestly, just read the book, or listen to it.","

"Divergent","deadwitchflying","27 February 2015","I have incredibly low expectations when it comes to young adult movies, and yet, I'm still disappointed. Many of you claimed that it is really similar to the hunger games. Well... yes and no. Divergent is stupider.First of all : the credits are still rolling and I don't know why there was a war and why dividing people into five district... I mean factions is gonna help maintaining peace. This is BS. No explanations, nothing. And we meet our lead character Kat... I mean Tris (notice how Katniss and Tris sound similar) played by Shailene Woodley. And for me, this is the first mistake they made in this movie. Woodley... I just don't like her. Her voice, her face, everything.But the crap really hits the fan when you learn that not only is she divergent but that this is something rare... How ? I mean, have you ever been 16 and not knowing what you wanted to be when you grow up or is everybody in this lousy version of Chicago conditioned or something ? I call BS on this part. Being divergent is not something rare especially at the age the characters are. It's not, and this is why the movie makes little sense.2nd problem : the factions. How does it maintain peace to restraint people to one single way of living for the rest of their lives ? And what about the faction-less (or homeless. It's literally the same thing) people ? They don't care about their fate ? They don't want abundant food and a home ? I mean, they can build a giant wall but can't feed the poor ? How perfect is that ?3rd problem : choosing a faction is nonsense. They don't even get to ""try"" them. If factions really have to fit who they are, they should be able to walk in their shoes for at least 48h each. Instead, they are giving a false choice : either you stay home safe or you explore the unknown with the risk of being kicked out. Concretely : it would not maintain peace IRL.Final major problem : The chemistry between Tris and Four is fake. In one of the early scenes of the movie, Four gives her the most beautiful, powerful middle finger ever : ""What makes you think you can talk to me ?"" And she doesn't seem to remember it afterwards, and worst of all, they don't share that much special moments in the movie. Their love seems forced by the circumstances.So, the plot is nonsense, the character development is poor, and so is the acting. I haven't talked about the action sequences at all, but trust me, it's not worth mentioning. Finally, the climax is... unexpectedly bad and makes little sense. I'm trying to keep the review spoiler-free so go watch it for yourself and you'll know what I'm talking about.","

"Divergent","g-bodyl","4 March 2015","To be quite frank, I enjoyed Divergent. I tried to read the book, but I was never able to finish reading the book. The movie is a better movie than I thought. I honestly don't get the comparisons between this and the Hunger Games other than the dystopian futures and a strong, female protagonist. They are both different stories and I enjoy each movie for different reasons. This movie doesn't feature strong romance and I like the fact how there are factions based off virtues, which I find intriguing. There are some cool action scenes and I also enjoyed the pretty effective visuals. Neil Burger's film is about a girl named Tris Prior who was assigned to the Dauntless faction, or pretty much the army of the city. She has a dark secret in which she is divergent, or the ability to have all virtues. The government has a plan to wipe out all Divergents and Tris, along with the mysterious Four, must figure out why and how to stop them. I believe that the cast did an excellent job. Shailene Woodley is a good, young actress and she played her role very well. Theo James actually made for a good Four and of course all the girls would be all over him. Jai Courtney, whom was bad in the last adaptation of Die Hard, delivers a stronger performance as the leader of Dauntless. Kate Winslet gives a malicious performance as the head government leader. Other standouts include Miles Teller and Ashley Judd. Overall, Divergent is the beginning of what seems to be another profitable, young-adult franchise. I love the nature of the film and it is a better movie than book, which is often very rare. I was able to understand the concepts, thus making me more appreciative of them. Is this the best young-adult movie? Of course not, but I regard highly the value of it being fun and entertaining. I cannot way to see this story continue. My Grade: A-","

I watched this movie just because of a great review that was saying that the movie exceeded the expectations etc, but believe me, this film is full of clichés, don't recommend to watch it on the theater, maybe is better to wait to arrive on blue-ray, I think the movie was made for the teenage public, because of that you are going to see all the peaces that worked in other teen movies on this one, I am just doing this review to alert the people that really likes a well constructed film, with a good script and not intended just to win money.However there is a good part about this movie, if want to see something with your girlfriend, something that you don't need to pay much attention or something that you can take a nap and wake up, this a good movie to do so, I don't need to say much about it, just watch the trailers, if I had watched and just didn't believe in just one review of one person I would really chosen another film, bye and good luck!","

However, my one complaint would be that Tris and Tobias were a bit awkward on screen together they always seemed so sure of themselves within the relationship and they meshed perfectly, but in the movie it just seems awkward and like they are trying too hard to be together.","

"Divergent","sandyrfarmer","22 March 2014","*Spoilers for people who haven't read the books.* You guys...Divergent has easily been the best book to movie adaptation that I've seen in a really, really long time. Let me just put that out there immediately.The actors: Shailene Woodley (Tris), Theo James (Four), Kate Winslet (Jeanine), Ashley Judd (Natalie, aka Tris's mom), Jai Courtney (Eric), Zoe Kravitz (Christina), Maggie Q (Tori), and Tony Goldwyn (Andrew, aka Tris's dad) all did magnificent jobs. I felt like Shailene and Theo especially were perfect for these roles. They were both how I pictured Tris and Four while I was reading Divergent, and they never once acted out of character. Truthfully, that's hard to find. I loved the chemistry that Shailene and Theo had while Theo also maintained Four's standoffish feel through the beginning of the movie. They're relationship felt legit. Shailene's best acting scene was when Tris lost her mother during the Dauntless attack on Abnegation. I teared up during that scene because her grief felt so real. You guys know I'm not a crier, so that's a small victory in and of itself.As always there are differences between any book and movie made based upon a book. The biggest differences that I noticed involved the widespread knowledge that Divergents exist at all. In the book, the only people who seem to know about Divergents are those who are Divergent themselves, ones who have family members who are (or were) Divergents, and Jeanine. It was slightly confusing to me as a viewer why Tris didn't know any details about what being Divergent meant when the knowledge that Divergents exist at all was fairly widespread. I feel like the movie makers made this decision in order to help along the viewers who may not have read the books.I was almost sad to see how little screen time Al was given. I don't know that we'd even been told his name when the major events involving him took place. I figure his scenes were probably cut for budget and timing purposes, but I was sad that we didn't see move of him and his struggle to become Dauntless. Four tells us that he was failing, but even if they'd simply told us his name and flashed to his ranking on the scoreboard we could have figured that out. Similarly, Molly is shown and there are a couple of scenes with her, but I don't think we were ever told her name in the movie.Probably for me, the most deviations revolve around Jeanine. She was a lot more present than I remember her being in Divergent, but I'm assuming that's because you don't hire an actress like Kate Winslet and not give her any screen time. PLUS I imagine the bigger reason being that because Jeanine's so present in Insurgent, she needed to be firmly established as ""public enemy number 1."" Another addition the movie makers made but that I actually think made more sense involved the mirrors in Tris's simulations. It seemed to me like Tris being able to look at her own reflection for any length of time is what usually woke her up to the fact that the simulations weren't real. And I liked how the movie makers pulled that in from the first scene of the book and made Tris's relationship with her own reflection have a deeper meaning and purpose.However many deviations there were between the book and this movie, I wasn't upset with any of them. Everything felt so much better with Divergent than with the other book the movie adaptations I've seen recently. The actors. The locations. The special effects. The smart decisions on what should be changed and what should remain the same. The marketing strategy. The overall feel of the movie. They just did so much right with this adaptation, and I can't thank the director and producers enough for doing a worthy job of this book.I wanted to spend some time addressing other specific scenes that I enjoyed so much, but when I started naming them in my head I felt like I was essentially naming all the scenes. HA! This is definitely one that I'll pay to see in the theater twice, and I can't wait to see them make Insurgent since there's not a doubt in my mind that they will. Divergent gets 9/10 Stars from me. Have you seen it? What did you think? Let me know!","

"Divergent","TyRawrrnosaurus","20 March 2014","In a very quick introduction voice over by Tris we are told that after a massive war society was broken into five factions to ensure it never happens again. Why the war happened, who it was with, and how it ended is never discussed, but at least Chicago has a large security fence as tall as a skyscraper surrounding the city to protect against a giant T-Rex or something. Planes must not be an issue either because they could easily fly over the fence, but we never see any flown; technology in this world is used for guns, digital display panels, seeing into a person's dreams, and instant tattoos, not for rebuilding a more suitable world to live in - that would be silly.Tris was born within the Abnegation faction aka the just and loyal Hufflepuffs. Abegnation are the leading figures of government because of their selflessness. She lives with her mother Natalie, father Andrew, and brother Caleb who is also taking the aptitude test despite being older, which makes no sense per the rules stating 16-year-olds must take the test and choose a faction.Now that Tris is 16-years-old, she must partake in a process where she is told to drink an unknown liquid to determine which clique she belongs to. Based on her results, she may find herself fitting in with Dauntless aka the courageous Gryffindors; Candor aka the ready-minded Ravenclaws; Erudite aka the cunning Slytherins; or the last group known as Amity who just farm and have no real stakes or voice in the entire film.Tris' results of her aptitude test are inconclusive and discovers she is a rare breed known as Divergent. Those labeled Divergent can fit into any faction because they are capable of having more than one personality trait – explanation as to why everyone else cannot achieve the same level of basic human nature is not provided. Through a sorting hat-like process, after wasting time with an aptitude test that tells each teen which faction they should belong to, everyone is able to choose a faction, via a blood sacrifice, they'd like to shack up with for the rest of their lives.Luckily for Tris, her aptitude test proctor Tori allowed her to walk away despite one line of dialogue telling us Divergents are a threat to the system. Evidence to prove Divergents are dangerous to the way of life is never explained well enough to truly justify as a threat. So Tris hides her little secret anyway and chooses Dauntless because she would not want to become factionless, a nomadic people without a home who are not accepted into any of the five factions – doesn't that make them Divergent? While spending almost an hour through a rigorous training regime to prove to us she is the one, we are introduced to a love interest named Four (Theo James). Four is the eye candy until the main conflict presents itself almost two-thirds of the way into the movie; the Erudites want to overthrow Abnegation as the leaders because selflessness is too weak and not logical. Heaven forbid anyone should be able to think beyond their means.With a taxing two hour and twenty minute run time, Divergent is a complete clunker. The real grit of the story doesn't begin until well over an hour in and it isn't until the last thirty minutes that some kind of resolve needs to happen. Since I haven't read the book, I'm not sure if it is Roth's lack of imagination or the screenwriters Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor's failure to bring the book to life, but Divergent is absolutely devoid of any kind of world building to make this film stand out besides its loony way of assigning factions to its citizens. They even use the Chicago's L transit system to ride into Hogwarts, I mean Dauntless.Strangely, there seems to be no adults anywhere unless they play a small role in the plot, and yet there are so many kids running around. The bulk of the movie is focused on these kids and their plight to fit into Dauntless. Tris and Four's parents become a convoluted piece of the puzzle near the final act, adding little relevance, clarity, emotional depth, or importance. Janine, an Erudite and President Snow rip-off, is one of the few adults we get to know and acts as the main antagonist, posing as a faceless, unmotivated, and irrational villain.Thankfully, Woodley and James are able to have enough chemistry on screen to provide some redeeming qualities. Another case of beautiful people falling for beautiful people. Without Woodley, Divergent could not stand a chance. There is also a Ron Weasley-esque sidekick for Tris named Christina as well as a Neville-esque boy named Will.Visually unimpressive with an uninspiring score that does nothing to better the film's lack of a personality, Divergent struggles even on a superficial level. Even a larger budget than most YA adaptations can't set it apart from the rest. Sets do not feel lived in and the different factions are hardly explored, making the world even more unbelievable than it already is.Themes of discovering who you are, understanding your place in the world, and standing up for yourself are practically force fed, but in the final third of the film the moral teachings diminish and Divergent transforms into a popcorn action flick. Burger tries to materialize high concepts of freewill, totalitarianism, and the human condition, but misses the mark by focusing more on the romance and action than answering the bigger questions.Divergent is simple fan service at its best; it even ends so abruptly that no ramifications of Erudite's actions, Tris' Rebellion, or Dauntless' coup d'etat are mentioned. Anyone going into this movie without having read the books is going to end up confused or annoyed by the sheer lack of coherence.","

"Divergent","misha1998","11 April 2014","I will tell you something; I have not read the book, so therefore I cannot really compare much to the source material (my friends have stated that the source material is far better than the movie).This movies starts bad with an unoriginal explanation of a Utopian scenario, which we have seen before in The Hunger Games and read before in The Giver. I mean, when can we have a YA movie without dystopia?!After that we are given factions (which serves as a plot element) and then we find Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) as a stereotypical girl who has absolutely NO character (besides being obviously raised by her mother and father, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE) and then while she is in one of the factions (Dauntless) she starts to suspect from Four (Theo James) that some sort of coup'de etat was happening...I mean this is another case of ripping off Deus Ex! (the game)Another thing I would like to criticize is the tendency that you have to put music with extremely annoying singing in the movie that has absolutely NO relevance to the plot. I mean, I think the songs that were put in the movie were supposed to make one of those ""intended audience members"" happy because the executives knew that this film was not well made and forced the editor to put in this absolutely unnecessary music!Now, if you dare me to say something good about this, I shall in the following. The fight scenes remind me lots of Fight Club, the romance is actually built up lots, and the whole cinematography reminded me of Terrence Malick. And I did like one scene after Prior is ambushed by some thugs and then when one of them apologizes, she not only declines but she actually tells them to never talk to her ever again. That moment, for me was a huge show stealer. Unfortunately, for me, I cannot really like this film and I do not recommend it, but the film cannot be bad when a scene like the one I just mentioned plays perfectly.","

"Divergent","IliasManos","17 August 2014","Before start with the analysis, just to give a quick opinion for those who don't wanna spend much time reading: If you older than 13-14, don't waste your time. I am not quite sure how long has it been since I've seen such a bad film, and by bad, I mean bad. This movie has nothing. No photography, no costumes, no soundtrack, the direction is at best mediocre, and the storyline does not even exist. 1h45m of static, stuck and non- progressing plot, with the saving part at the end, saving the city in 10 minutes and that's it. First of all, whoever wrote this should be at least ashamed. A boring, blunt, cliché and repetitive classic storyline about a little girl that can not fit the society and wants to be different and not in types?? I mean, what is the target group here? 13 years old teenagers? Furthermore, the whole film has absolutely no sense. The main problem of the character is that she is not clearly oriented into a faction because she is intelligent, brave, has compassion and she's kind. What a nonsense. Further more into this, the acting is just terrible, like if someone would pick a random person and ask him/her to say these lines. Only exception is the death scene with the mother of the heroine where the acting is bad/mediocre. All the rest is not even acting. No dialogs, no strong scenes, not even one monologue, nothing. 2 stars only for the fact that this was not shot in a camcorder, and for casting Winslet (what was she thinking...)","

"Divergent","afiffifa89","22 July 2014","I have no idea how any sensible person can call this a good movie. What they actually depicted in this movie was a society following a Military Code of Conduct. Funny part was nobody had any idea what a military code of conduct was. It could have been a great comedy. But they had to make one absolute rubbish action movie. The whole concept of the depicted society is flawed. Our fear has nothing to do with our virtues. Testing someone's fear has nothing to do with what that person is capable of. People react differently in different kind of situations. Our motives drives us, not our fears.When 'Tris' started training, at the first day the trainees started questioning their superiors. They were like kids thrown into a pit with guns. Their superiors were also ridiculous, as even though they were trying really hard to keep the kids in line, they had no idea how. They forgot the thousands years of military rules that were created to keep soldiers in line and they were never really marching other than when they all became cyborgs like thingy. They were running around like kids in a playground, just this time the kids had guns with them and the normal civilian people was completely okay with it. Now let's come to 'Tris and her hypocrisy. First of all, she's the last person to b ever handling a gun. Simplest reason is she was supposed to b dead(like surely, as she was also running without cover and stuff a lot) three times in total in this movie. First, before killing her friend, who missed a shot at point blank range. second, when she was crying about her mother being dead. she dropped her gun, started crying and holding her mom and then asked the people who was shooting at them to stop. And those cyborg like humans were still holding their position and shooting at the wall, instead of making any attempt to go near them. I would expect cyborg humans(who are supposed to be fearless) to be a bit more daring if i might say so. And the third time, she got caught trying to free her boyfriend. They didn't had any use of her. And even if they did why not just shoot her. All those people were supposed to be goal oriented. Killing her with a simple bullet would've been it. But none of those people even tried to subdue her. So bravo for being the luckiest person on that whole place. About her hypocrisy, she was the one wasting time with her mother with lines like ""I killed him :'("". If she hadn't, her mother could have lived. Yet, after all she's the one who says to the other people that there's no time to waste. And then she had to get into the cool white room all alone, and had to try to do everything to get her boyfriend back again. Instead of just simply killing the people who were on their way towards a mass genocide. Which wasted more time? These are just some of of the major things i noticed. But there were many others too. So please broaden your mind and think how people can become so naive?","

"Divergent","zkonedog","28 February 2017","Whenever most books or films are made for the young adult audience, there are certain ""benchmarks"" that need to be hit in order to appeal to the target audience (e.g. attractive actors, romance, angst, simple concepts). While those benchmarks make those works extraordinarily popular for that target audience, they also limit the book or film's appeal to a broader population. That is why, at least for me (28-year old male), ""Divergent"" was just an ""okay"" movie.For a basic plot summary, ""Divergent"" tells the story of Tris (Shailene Woodley), a teenage girl living in a future society where each person must choose from a prescribed list of professions upon a certain date. There is an aptitude test that helps determine which profession one should tend towards. The trouble with Tris, however, is that her test comes up ""divergent"", meaning that her brain doesn't focus on just one of the areas. This is something that must be hidden, as it is looked down upon and may make her a danger to government officials like Jeanine (Kate Winslet). Choosing a profession that is somewhat surprising, Tris makes the transition to a soldier-type life, where she meets Four (Theo James), a superior who is tough on her but also shows an interest in her well-being.I liked the framework upon which the plot of this movie is built (I've never read the book, so I really can't make comparisons). Every high school student has taken a ""which career should I choose?"" test, so the concept is very relate-able. The whole ""what to do next in life"" is something we can all relate to, young adults probably more than anyone.The problem, though, is that ""Divergent"" tries to cram a lot of things into a relatively small (2 hours, 15 minutes) package. There's drama, action, romance, political intrigue, big ideas...a little too much to focus on making one or two areas really, really good. For example (minor spoiler ahead), there is one character death in the movie that is supposed to be a very sad, emotive moment. However, because the relationships hadn't been developed well enough up until that point, it just kind of falls flat.Contemporary films like ""Hunger Games"" and ""The Giver"" (both films that I enjoyed) do a better job of ""camouflaging"" the young adult aspects (though not omitting them, obviously) in order to appeal to a broader audience. ""Giver"" pulls not punches that it is a concept-driven film first and foremost, while ""Hunger Games"" (like the book series) doesn't get into the real angst-y, drama stuff until later on in the series. Thus, I felt like ""Divergent"" takes the action of the Hunger Games and the concepts of The Giver and combines them to produce...an inferior product of that melding.""Divergent"" isn't a bad movie but any stretch of the imagination. It has a decent plot, the action always moves forward, and drama is present. It just won't captivate audiences beyond its target range of teenagers.","

"Divergent","ChristianDrey","27 July 2014","Divergent. I have read the series already and I should say, this movie is one of those that actually exceeded my expectation. Exceeded in the sense that the movie's depiction of Chicago is better than what my brain told me. I just had a bit of a different take on Four and Eric but other than that, this is a great movie for the novel. I cannot wait for Insurgent.It could have gotten a higher rating from me if the story on the movie was more ""following the book"". Also, what I noticed on the story in the movie is that a lot of things, important things, are shortened and were not given enough attention. One example of this is the end part starting from the moment she shot Wil. I know things have to be changed in order for the movie to be not too lengthy that is understandable.Lastly, Kate Winslet is AWESOME! This, I believe, is the first movie I saw that she is in as a villain and my oh my she did Jeanine's character well. Exactly how I imagined her to be even better, I think.","

"Divergent","kluseba","25 April 2014","Dystopian teenie movies are all the rage these days. In my opinion, ""The Hunger Games"" and Company can't catch up with classics like ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""Rollerball"", ""Soylent Green"" and so on. ""The Hunger Games"" was already almost just a rip-off of the famous Japanese book and movie ""Battle Royale"". At least, ""The Hunger Games"" had a few great actors, stunning costumes and settings and loads of action. ""Divergent"" is now a rip-off of ""The Hunger Games"" series. My advice for you is to watch the originals instead of what Hollywood wants to be the next blockbusters.So basically, this is a rip-off of a rip-off. But ""Divergent"" features less impressive actors and actresses that portray more or less convincing characters. I could not connect with any of them but maybe the target audience of teenage girls would see things differently. The costumes and settings are much duller than those in ""The Hunger Games"". The action scenes are a lot less urgent. Even the story is rather frustrating in here, feels rather random and is even a little bit hard to follow at some points. The movie's villain has not much charisma either.The film wants to introduce the female main character Tris as somebody special. She passes a mental test that should indicate one of the five factions she would best fit with. People in dystopian Chicago are either brave, intelligent, peaceful, selfless or truthful in an isolated and precisely structured society after a great war that is not further explained. Tris doesn't fit to any of these factions in particular and is divergent. This is already rather strange. The so-called test lasted for maybe one minute and the main character acted in a completely normal way where I would have taken the same decisions if this test was for real. One doesn't really believe the movie that Tris is so different and special. She is an ordinary looking girl with ordinary skills who is about to go through an ordinary bad meets evil plot and to fall in love with an ordinary good-looking young man. The base of this story is already rather odd.The entire story is not much better. The so-called divergents are considered being a danger for the elite and are chased down by governmental forces. Tris joins the brave faction and tries to hide her secret. One day, the intelligent faction tries to overthrow the leading selfless faction with the the help of the mentally manipulated brave faction. Tris and her boyfriend who turns out to be the son of the leader of the selfless faction (what a surprise) will obviously save the world in a few minutes.Between the initial test and the final battle scenes, this movie is filled with endless mental and physical games and simulations that portray the main characters everyday life among the brave faction. The fighting scenes vary between being visually stunning and being ordinary. The supporting characters in the brave faction are superficial and don't add anything to the plot line. The failed assassination attempt of the main character feels completely random and out-of-place. Basically, the first and maybe the last thirty minutes of this movie are addicting while the rest tries to kick off some character development and dystopian world exploration that is mostly uninteresting because both characters and the dystopian world are rather ordinary. This all sounds rather negative and it is. So you might ask why I still gave this movie half of the points. The reasons are simple. I'm a big fan of dystopian books and movies and even the worst examples still attract my attention. The special effects are well done and worth to be seen in the cinema. The capture-the-flag game at some point in the movie is my personal highlight set in an interesting atmosphere and location. As I said, the first thirty minutes of the movie are rather entertaining and promising. The final thirty minutes are filled with action and tension. Even though the outcome of the story is highly predictable, the last thirty minutes will get you on the edge of your seats. There are even a few emotional moments in there when some characters need to do some important sacrifices. Not everything is bad in here. Half of the movie is well done, the other half really ordinary.In the end, it's up to you to decide whether you would like to watch the rip-off (""The Hunger Games"") of a rip-off (""Battle Royale""). If you liked the rip-off, you might also appreciate most parts of ""Divergent"". If you thought the rip-off was of an average quality or below, let me tell you that this movie here is clearly below the rip-off's quality. Don't waste your time on it then. As a fan of the genre, I had a little bit more than two and a half mostly entertaining hours. The movie was made to watch it in the cinemas because of its solid sound and visual effects. On the other side, I would certainly not watch it again and I wouldn't buy or rent this film either. If there was a sequel in a few years, I would probably feel like watching it for the sake of having already watched the first part but I would feel hesitating. Don't get yourself into the same situation. I would rather suggest you to avoid this movie and watch something more original which basically means that you should look for the original dystopian movies.","

"Divergent","Expat-in-America","28 April 2021","I can see how it tries to fit into the YA 'dystopia' genre but this series has nothing original and is full of silly plot holes. It tries to rework tropes we have seen done so much better in other films with higher stakes, and with better more well rounded created worlds.People can only have one personality trait? You can't be smart, brave, and kind? That makes zero sense, considering the story doesn't clarify if they have somehow modified human behaviour and emotions etc to make people so unimaginably one dimensional. The idea that 'people who have complex emotions are a threat' is so simplistic that it's kind of insulting to viewers.I watched because Theo James is a fantastic actor, but the lead actress in this is just so terrible, even he can't save it.","

"Divergent","hannahray123","15 February 2015","I am not very into the trilogy that this movie is based on, but I really liked the first book. I was quite excited to see it as a movie, entering the theater with high hopes. The clothing design was sexist. Seriously, it's the future, and women are still accustomed to body-revealing ""serious"" clothes; ranging from sexy skin-tight Erudite mini-skirts to Tris's sexy black tank top. The book was nothing like this; women wore pants.Excuse me for being a feminist, but that was a small part of the movie that had bugged me. The acting was bland, the character designs were bland, and the whole movie was rushed. Each scene just... breezed by, like the whole movie was saying ""okay, okay, yeah, yeah, you saw this scene already, let's just get this story over and done with because, apparently, the writers just don't care about our personal entertainment.""the length had made it seem like a kid's movie, along with the fact that even the romance scenes with Tris and Four were small and sped up, and the violence scenes! There was hardly any violence. For example at the scene where Tris was almost pushed over the chasm, there was literally a few pushing and shoving and then DONE. And where are the guns? The book had included real guns with bullets, but in the movie everyone was using these weird, ""futuristic"" guns that shot spike- like bullets and didn't even show blood... no one told me this was a freaking PG movie.What a waste of money. The book had unforgettable characters, great dialogue, and creative, heart-shattering scenes. This movie felt more like a joke; I wouldn't be surprised to find out, one day, that this had actually been made as a parody of sci-fi/action/romance movies. It would have done better as a parody than as a movie.","

We are told that forming of factions was the only solution for peace... If the conflict was in the city between city residents, what is the point of the wall around? If it was some outside threat, what is the point in inner city social structure? Wouldn't defense be stronger if defenders were everybody that can, instead just brave/reckless volunteers in black-shirt faction?Nobody cared to explain how can this system even begin to help bring peace. Nobody cared to explain how people became robots capable of only one trait. We have those guys with guns, and we don't know how they work? Are they independent? Are they enforcing some laws? Who make the laws? Why do they leave hobos to stay in city, what do they have to lose if they rebel? Isn't that threat to peace? Doesn't the smart ones see that? But the smart ones would realize that faction system is stupid... Wait, of course, the smart are only capable of being smart, they are incapable of saying the truth... Other ones are the ones which tell the truth. But they are too stupid to know anything... Uhhh, what a conundrum!What happens to police/military faction members when they grow too old to run everywhere while screaming like little girls, and to jump on rooftops out of moving trains? We know they can't change their mind and become smart, or go farming, so do they conveniently die, or just go to hobo nation? I smell another threat to peace, disgruntled veterans left with nothing...And the ending... After exposing major conspiracy, and after stupid system should collapse like house of cards, we have our heroes running away just so there could be couple of pointless sequels.

"Divergent","oscarxp25","30 March 2014","Since the release of the juggernaut ""Twilight"" back in 2008, Hollywood has been searching for any film, based on a young adult novel, that would spark the same craze those movies did. While some are successes, such as ""The Hunger Games"", there are countless others that just fall to the waste side. Does the new film ""Divergent"" rise to occasion or just fall into the same league as the other failures? The plots of ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" are very similar but different in their own ways. Both take place in a futuristic society that has become a wasteland. The people in these societies have been split into different factions that serve their own purpose to the high power of the government. These governments try to play it off as if they are one of the people but, of course, stand for everything these societies are built on, which is freedom.In ""Divergent"", which takes place in a post-war Chicago, people are split into five factions: the selfless Abgenations, the peaceful Amitys, the honest Candors, the brave Dauntless, and the intelligent Edrudites. When children are sixteen they are given a test to see where they would fit in. After the results are given, they are must choose to go with what their results were or choose their own path. Our young heroine, Beatrice or Tris as she later refers to herself as, is urged by her family and faction in Abnegation to stay, but becomes part of the Dauntless. She wants to be part of the group who protects the city and lives a more wild lifestyle than the other four.The first half of the film is a bit slow paced. It is a very stereotypical journey of a fragile young woman slowly being transforming into a strong woman. As Tris, the film's star Shailene Woodley does just fine. Tris isn't as powerful of a character as Katniss from ""The Hunger Games"" but also isn't a complete bore like Bella Swan. She falls nicely in the middle. Though Woodley, at times, does play it bland at times she does own the role and makes you care about this young girl and her journey.Director Neil Burger does the future well. It is a very sterile future that seems too clean and pure for its own good. As far as the look of everything it echoes science fiction films like ""Logan's Run"". Burger does have some pacing issues with a run time that went a bit too long. It is close to 150 minutes. Some of it, especially the beginning, could have been trimmed a bit. The only other fault I would give the director would be the waste of the role that Winslet has. What is with Hollywood casting great actresses to fill roles that aren't good enough for their talents? It happened in ""Elysium"" with Jodie Foster and it does in this film with Winslet. It isn't a terrible performance but one that just requires them to go through the motions of being a typical female baddie, right down to the wardrobe.Those things that don't work are overshadowed by what does work. The film is quite smart in the way it handles what it has to say. The title of the film comes from those select people in society who have all the qualities of the five factions. They have the ability to have empathy and see situations as whole instead of just through their own factions beliefs. Of course, the higher ups, who are the Edrudities, don't want this because this would inspire hope in people through ideas. They are creating soldiers through brain washing their citizens into doing their dirty work. It is a an interesting way to communicate to younger people, who read these novels, the power of influence and the even greater power of fear of non-acceptance. Even though she can kick ass, which she does to her costar Milles Teller, who plays a sleaze bag here, who also starred with in the the terrific ""The Spectacular Now"", Tris' true power is her ability to influence others and show that they don't have to succumb to others beliefs. Woodley does have the pureness to sell this ideal. One of her initiation processes is facing her fears head on in a dream like sequence. Burger captures the insanity that goes through a young teenage girl's mind perfectly. Especially one in the wasted world where Beatrice grew up in. There are other surprisingly wise decisions made in this film to communicate the down falls of a controlled society which you should see for yourself.While ""The Hunger Games"" shows its points through a grand and epic scale, ""Divergent"" is more cerebral in the way it lays out its evidence. ""Divergent"" maybe the answer to people who like a less flashy way of telling them the downfalls of the ""perfect society","

"Divergent","Winchester_United","25 March 2014","I understand not keeping things 100% the same in book to film adaptations, especially if they're not integral parts to the plot or if they don't translate well to screen, but many of the things that were suspenseful in the book were completely removed or trimmed away to help get that pg 13 rating and while sometimes less can be more, it certainly wasn't in this case as much of the gravitas and suspense being removed and trimmed away as well, there was not even any lack of urgency until the film was partly in it's second half.I also feel like somethings should have been explained better for those who hadn't read the books. For instance in the film and even the trailer we see the character Tori tell Beatrice that ""you're divergent, the test didn't work on you"" but in no point of the film do they really explain why the initial test didn't pan out, I mean we see how Beatrice manipulates the tests later on even in the trailer (""this isn't real""/breaks the glass) but we never get the reasoning why she tested for multiple factions thus being divergent","

"Divergent","chrispybacon123","5 June 2014","(My spoiler isn't until the very end) I don't just dislike this movie because I read the book- I really wanted to like it and was looking forward to seeing it. But yes the book was incredibly good and the movie did not do it justice at all. Even if I hadn't read the book, my opinion wouldn't change. There was no character development- leaving the audience detached from the characters. They also didn't develop any of the characters relationships - not Tris' with her fiends Christina, Will, and Al, and especially not with Four. There should have been good, emotional moments in the movie but there just weren't. Normally I can get pretty emotional when it comes to movies but I am sure that if Tris and Four had just died at any point, I would not have been upset because there was no attachment thanks to the TOTAL LACK of character development. I understand that they can't fit everything that happened it the book the way it happened because movies have time limits, but I think they very poorly chose what moments to include. All the parts I was looking forward to were either not included or were completely devoid of emotion and intensity. SPOILER: The moment when Tris has to shoot her best fiend Peter should be sad because he's her best friend- but it's not because their relationship never developed so the audience can hardly know how good of friends they were. If I hadn't read the book I'm not sure I would've even recognized who he was- even if I did it wouldn't have been an emotional moment because the audience didn't really get a chance to know his character, or any of the others for that matter.","

Turned out it wasn't like that. Many around me compared it to the Hunger Games and I suppose that in some ways it resembles it, but personally I think Divergent is so much better. I honestly don't care that much about small movie mistakes, such as the wound at her ear or stuff like that. It's not those details that give the quality of a movie. The acting does and I was very pleased with the acting. It suited the subject and the atmosphere the movie tried to create. So I'm looking forward for the sequels. My only hope is that the sequels won't be boring or exaggerated, like man sequels are. This is why sequels usually suck compared to the first movie.

What ticked me off about this movie is that it was pretty different from the book, (enough to make me annoyed) and that the entire relatively new cast (besides Winslet) cannot act. Theo James is sexy and he knows it in the movie, and Shailene Woodley is just ugh I can't explain it but she cannot act!

If you have any self-respect don't repeat my mistake. On the bright side it won't be very difficult to forget this one. The story line was like one written by an overenthusiastic 13 year old with aspirations to be a writer and a sycophantic audience pushing him/her along with mindless enthusiasm.

"Divergent","TheMarwood","23 July 2014","This boneheaded blunt force allegorical tale about a teen with the ability to think with free will, which is dangerous in this dystopian society, is too derivative to swallow. Divergent is tailor made for the least discerning teen viewer, who likes their characters a bit less than one dimensional and their romances telegraphed with all the artistry of a daytime soap. The attempt to class up these proceedings with what amounts to an extended cameo by Kate Winslet backfires with her villainous role, that even she can't transcend with this cornball material. Shailene Woodley barely registers as a presence, has no charisma and can't carry this film. She brings nothing to her role and you have to demolish suspension of disbelief to accept her as a young woman who can handle herself in action. The effects are adequate, with the exception of a zip line sequence through some run down skyscrapers, that serves no narrative purpose but to show off some effects they didn't have the money to do correctly. Running at about two hours and twenty minutes, Divergent begins with our main character having to make the most important decision of her life by choosing her faction - but there's no suspense or compelling material watching an undeveloped character go through this. The narrative then becomes an endless series of training sequences, before rushing into a last act that feels like an entire sequel condensed into a climax. With so little substance, it's going to be an insurmountable task to make this a running series of films that won't be instantly crushed under the weight of its own flimsy premise.","

"Divergent","leather-turtle","16 April 2014","I was willing to take a risk on watching this movie late at night because it sounded like something bold and daring and I trusted Kate Winslet's name on the credits.Kate Winslet's character is actually in charge of the conformist government and her acting skills seemed entirely negated in this role, like she plays a zombie for the entire film, and there's nothing interesting about the character she plays.I've never seen Twilight or any movie in the series, but this movie got me in the mood to give them a shot. I think they'd be an improvement.What starts off as a bright and hopeful movie with the central character, Beatrice Prior (Tris in the cast listing), giving an attractive assessment of the factions, especially Dauntless, turns into something dark and... stupid. She enters Dauntless and finds that it's run by jerks. We get the predictable scenes and scenarios of her almost getting kicked out of Dauntless to become factionless but she barely makes it in. She befriends one of the jerks who helps her and with whom she's destined to fall in love, just as in every other mainstream, teenage romance.One of the parts that made me groan was when Beatrice Prior climbed the ferris wheel to get a better view of their opponents and her romantic interest and co-leader of the group, ""Four"", didn't want to follow her any higher BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID OF HEIGHTS. He even said, ""We all have our weakness."" This, to me, was an overt attempt to appeal to every cowardly teenager who is also afraid of heights and a clear declaration of how spineless ""Divergent"" as a movie really is. There was a lot of this kind of follow-through.Beatrice Prior, in being ""Divergent"", is actually a pretty normal teenage girl/woman who doesn't so much fit into a category as wants to fulfill her potential. Everyone else pretty much chooses conformity. It's as if being ""Divergent"" reaches a ceiling of conformity in this movie and everyone's lives become predictable.I sincerely DO NOT recommend this movie unless you're in the mood to shove plastic brain pulp into your head. It sucked. I'm giving it 6 stars because it has Hollywood production quality, and I like to reserve much lower ratings for movies that don't even try to live up to mainstream expectations.Besides: This movie doesn't suck in any exceptional way other than calling itself ""Divergent"" when it's one of the most conformist, mainstream, and mediocre movies I've ever seen. It deserves a mediocre rating....It makes me a bit sad that this movie is classified as Sci-Fi... and Action to a lesser degree. At least when Twilight is called Fantasy, one may readily add ""delusional teenage"", which seems possibly more appropriate here when the same kind of movie is titled ""Divergent"". I don't think many Sci-Fi or Action movie fans will enjoy this movie. It looks like quality, but it's really schlock.The least disappointing parts of this movie involved the excellent acting of Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn, who play Beatrice Prior's parents. They play the roles so well, convincingly, and genuinely, that I could forget for that time that the rest of the movie lacked any depth, meaning, or sincerity. For their screen time, I didn't feel I had to hold a great big load of crap at the back of my mouth to entertain the premise of the movie while all meaning of that premise was repeatedly violated by flat, spineless characters. Judd and Goldwyn deserve significant praise for pulling that off, and fortunately their characters were both killed during the movie so they probably won't have to endure any sequels to come :-)This is another movie suitable for the decadent, self-deceived, spoiled teenagers who have yet to actually deal with reality on their own and discover the real consequences of being ""Divergent"", but good and bad.","

"Divergent","zaraleejensen","13 April 2014","Good screenplay and all - but the actors where stiff, and the trailer gave off the idea of some amazing action / sci-fi movie - which turned out to be some teenage love story / empowerment to teenage girls. I went in expecting to be kept on the edge of my seat with all the exciting things, but when the people started jumping off trains, i seriously wanted to start cracking up laughing. I lasted about 20 minutes into this, then couldn't handle it anymore. I've heard people compare it to hunger games - WRONG. I love hunger games, this was just terrible! If i had of honestly known what this movie was going to be like - i wouldn't have even bothered to download it.","

"Divergent","kristofen","14 September 2014","What did you expect? The Godfather? Granted I don't think its perfect but reading all these 1/10 negative reviews made me up my rating. You're a bunch of Erudites! Seriously, though, you can't watch Frozen and expect it to have Quentin Tarantino quality. Its like humor, not everyone has the same taste. Satire might not be your crucifix, that doesn't make a joke ""low quality"". The plot is pretty solid if you ask me, a post-apocalyptic society where the survivors developed a communistic system to avoid future chaos considering human nature drove the past civilization to destruction. Divergents have multiple aptitudes making them a threat to linear society. l admit I have above average intelligence, but even my 12 year old cousin understood the premise. The casting was splendid, Oscar nominee Shailene Woodley especially the scene where shes crying (no spoiler here) and Theo James' character develops well and opens up progressively and we were all genuinely terrified of Jai ""Eric""'s ruthlessness. Also Kate Winslet played a fine bitchy dame. The dialogue was believable and appropriate for the story (they were teens and this isn't a witty comedy). Overall, the story was thought-provoking. To those missing the bigger picture, there's actually a connection between this universe and ours. Our society also categorizes people either by race, religion, politics, culture, education, sexuality, school cliques (in a small range), etc. There's always expectations in each group, a social code that must be followed. I actually enjoy the way Divergent depicts authority in such a menacing way, showing how ridiculous these bigots can be. Why are there laws against gay marriage or against innocent children who were forced into the US and can't get an education/driver's license/job when they're adults? Ignorance, that's why. I hope this movie inspired its targeted young audience to rebel and fight for what is right in their judgment.","

"Divergent","steadrick1","24 July 2014","Let's put aside the preposterous dystopian future that only a child of privilege could envisage i.e. one that has not even a fleeting knowledge of the human condition because she's never suffered.So you have the requisite shallows to suspend disbelief and you settle down to watch essentially a C movie rip off of the Hunger Games. Don't get me wrong I'm not a massive fan of the hunger games films but at least there was some originality, great casting and performances.So our heroine (aka Katniss lite) finds she is a divergent ie she can do more that one thing - and the overwhelming feeling is one of 'so what'. These two words echoed inside my head for the entire remainder of the film.And that's it folks. Our heroine's struggle is one big 'so what'. Her training 'so what'. Her escape 'so what', the revelations 'so what', the tattoos 'so what', the fight back 'so what' etc etc. All the way to the end when it just becomes one big 'so what'. So what was the point. As an auteurs vision it is non existent. You could hot swap a whole host of middle of the road jobbing Hollywood directors and the end result would be this. This is not an auteurs film. Watch a Michael Mann, Scorsese or Christopher Nolan film and you know you are watching a singular directors vision. Whilst even their films may have their flaws they are compelling narratives delivered with visual and artistic flair.So if it's not that then what is it.It is a commercial venture designed to separate the viewing public from their money. It's a cynical exploitation of the hunger games films. That fact that is not very good and is an insult to the intelligence of anyone with even moderate intelligence is irrelevant ultimately. It's a money grabbing turd. Exactly the kind of film Hollywood wants. So next time when you go to the theatre and you notice an odd smell when you hand over your twelve bucks you're probably in the queue for Divergent 2.I'd tell you to avoid it but it's probably too late.",NA
"Divergent","magnuslhad","12 September 2014","I'm a fan of near-future films set in dystopian worlds, but this 'Hunger Games' rip-off never tries to reach beyond its obvious 16-24-year old demographic. Young adults are assigned to clan-like groups based on their personality type. Those who do not fit any profile, Divergents, are seen as a threat. This flimsy premise is the basis for an incoherent narrative that neither entertains not provokes thought. The sole purpose seems to be to show the young, fit cast running, jumping, climbing, punching, kicking ass and wielding big guns. Kate Winslet mugs it up and it would not be a surprise if she winked directly at camera. I wasn't expecting it to be 'Gattaca', but the fact that it is this flat and predictable is disappointing.",NA
"Divergent","chibitapy","21 December 2015","The concept of this movie is very unique although it still shows us how ""love"" is more important than any others. And I also like that it takes a whole movie to know such a simple thing. It's so interesting if human is divided into 4 kinds in the real world, but I'm afraid it can happen by people being more religious and getting authority in groups. I didn't know that this movie is so popular when I watched this, but I feel like it's going to be very popular in Japan as well if people get to have a chance to know about this movie. the review of this movies is not really good but I still recommend you to watch this movie because it's worth it.",NA
"Divergent","horseshrink","5 August 2014","After the really decent book to movie translations of Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and The Hunger Games, my hopes were up, but this left me disappointed.I've read the series. The books were engaging enough to pull me one into the next. This movie didn't engage me in the same manner. It didn't bother me to stop it and continue the next day. Something was missing. I didn't become emotionally invested in the screen characters. The movie skipped through critical book plot events and lingered on romantic interludes. I don't know. Not holding my breath for the next movie.",NA
