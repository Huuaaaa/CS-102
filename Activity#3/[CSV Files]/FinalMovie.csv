"Ready or Not","ThomDerd","5 January 2020","Grace is about to marry the youngest member of the very wealthy Le Domas family. But there's something sinister going on with this family... Well, the movie's central idea is not that new but the delivery of the idea, the pace and the performance of Samara Weaving really elevate this film. Entertaining and tense with comical moments that fit the genre, will make you follow almost all the characters in the film. Also kudos to the slow costume transformation of the bride and the juxtaposition of the prior wedding shots with what happens after, as this helps create a sense of relatability with Grace.One of the entertaining movies of 2019.8/10.","

"Ready or Not","kosmasp","8 February 2020","Or is it? Right from the start we do realize there is more to it than just a simple game. So with that overshadowing the next section of the movie (viewer being ahead of our main character/heroine), it is up to the actors and the dialog/script to keep us on our toes and make this entertaining nonetheless.And the movie succeeds in doing so. I guess it could have been even better in some respects, but overall this is really good. The characters make sense (in their own universe) and the story is coherent enough (even if you may disagree with that statement during the end - I think the joke works quite well ... but that's me). Not for the faint hearted for sure ...","

"Ready or Not","planktonrules","31 October 2020","""Ready of Not"" is a very, very violent, bloody and crude film. I am not necessarily criticizing it for this, but you must know this before you decide to watch. It clearly is an adult film...but even one most adults might have trouble watching because of all the gore. Be forewarned...you will see extreme violence, exploding people and more!!! Think twice before you watch!!This should be the best day of Grace's life. After all, she's just married a handsome guy from an incredibly wealthy family. But apparently, this marriage comes with a possible downside....the family are all Satan worshipers who owe their immense wealth to their demon master. And, as part of maintaining their wealth, they have a ritual for when new blood marries into the family...and if you pick the wrong card, the family hunts you and sacrifices you! What follows is this crazy family and their servants chasing Grace about in order to kill her and impress their lord and master!Despite the summary and TONS of blood and gore, the film is also a comedy. It's not a fall on the floor laughing sort of film but a darkly sick and twisted sort of comedy. The ending combines both...intense gore and the biggest laughs of the movie. Not everyone's taste...but funny and sick. And, it's also not for those who get motion sick, as the shaky cam is, unfortunately, overused in the movie.","

"Ready or Not","TreasureHunterGirl","31 October 2019","Yes, it is a horror. Yes, it is a comedy. Yes, it is a great watch.I laughed a lot watching this movie. I also cringed a few times from the gorey horror. I didn't know much about it going in. I honestly couldn't pick how it would end which means I was interested the whole way through.I liked all of the performances, especially those of Samara Weaving and Adam Brody. They had interesting characters. Andie MacDowell and Henry Czerny were great too. Everyone was. No one let the team down.I really enjoyed this movie. I honestly don't understand all the 1 and 2 ratings. Even if you didn't like it, it doesn't deserve that low of a rating. It was just a really fun movie to watch. Give it a chance.","

"Ready or Not","Leofwine_draca","20 October 2020","READY OR NOT is an interesting film but also a deeply flawed one that's never quite as funny or as entertaining as it tries to be. I liked the whole idea of the sinister rich family in their wonderful 'old dark house' inspired mansion and the idea of the heroine being hunted down, a little like the French flick FRONTIERS. Unfortunately what promises to be a TURKEY SHOOT-style cat and mouse story of human hunting turns into a largely aimless comedy with repetitive set-pieces and a sub-par script substituting bad language for wit. It's a pity, as the direction is solid and the performances are strong, but imagine this cast with proper dialogue to play with! I also found the climax a cop out as I was expecting this kind of over-obvious thing to happen. Not a bad film, just something I was expecting more from.","

"Ready or Not","Bertaut","14 October 2019","Written by Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy, and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, Ready or Not is a horror-comedy and social satire that comically exaggerates the anxieties attendant with marrying into a wealthy family and mocks the insular nature of such families, so obsessed with their wealth that they've become disconnected from the real world. In the tradition of Richard Connell's 1924 short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"", the film is about elites hunting common folk, but it tells its story with tongue firmly in cheek. And whilst it can be a tad episodic at times, and the manner in which it presents some of its violence is somewhat problematic, this is a very enjoyable and funny film that's well worth checking out.It is the wedding day of Grace (an exceptional Samara Weaving) and Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), whose family earned their fortune making board games, and are now decadently wealthy. Several years previously, Alex turned his back on the family, and it's only since he met Grace (a foster child eager to have a family to call her own) that he has started to rebuild bridges. His mother Becky (Andie MacDowell) and father Tony (a barely sane Henry Czerny) are thrilled to have him back, and credit Grace with his return. His aunt Helene (a hilariously acerbic Nicky Guadagni), however, makes no bones about the fact that she hates Grace. Elsewhere there's Alex's brother Daniel (Adam Brody), an alcoholic locked in a loveless marriage to Charity (Elyse Levesque), and their cocaine-addicted sister Emilie (a wonderfully hapless Melanie Scrofano) and her husband Fitch (a scene-stealing Kristian Bruun). Shortly after the ceremony, Alex explains a strange family tradition to Grace - whenever someone new marries into the clan, they must participate in a game, chosen at random by a mechanised box using a deck of cards (Charity gor checkers). At an austere ceremony, Grace is asked to operate the box and she receives the hide and seek card, with Tony explaining that the only way for her to win is to stay hidden until dawn. And so, Grace hides in the mansion, unaware that the family (sans Alex) are arming themselves with crossbows, axes, hunting rifles, and assorted antique weaponry.The film's various psychoanalytical/satirical subtexts are fairly obvious - a lampooning of blue blood families clueless as to how the real world works, a savage deconstruction of the institution of marriage, and a gynocentric celebration of a woman fighting back against old-world patriarchy. In relation to these last two themes, nowhere are they more apparent than in Grace's wedding dress, that most classic symbol of marriage, which becomes dirtier and more damaged as the film progresses, with costume designer Avery Plewes using the dress to show the stages of Grace's symbolic deconstruction of the institution of marriage (to survive the night, she must make the dress more conducive to running and hiding, which involves a lot of ripping and tearing).Concerning the film's engagement with wealth, essentially it suggests that, yes, as we all know, the rich are very different from you and I, but could it be that not only are they different, maybe they're actually evil? Of course, it's not suggesting this with anything even approaching realism, and much of the film's humour comes from the Le Domas family itself; they're wealthy, evil, violent, and powerful, but so too are they hilariously incompetent. For example, it's been so long since anyone has got the hide and seek card that everyone is a little fuzzy on the rules, and they spend a good chunk of the film arguing with one another about the hunt - Fitch and Charity want to use modern weapons, but Tony maintains they have to use antique weaponry, nor are they allowed to use the castle's security cameras to track Grace.This all goes back to a century-old deal made between the family's original patriarch Victor and a mysterious traveller named Mr Le Bail, who promised Victor that the family would become hugely wealthy, but only if they maintained the tradition of having new family members play a game on their wedding night, laying out the rules for what was to happen if they got the hide and seek card. Tony argues that the rules can be no different from those originally established by Le Bail, but, really, his argument never amounts to much more than ""tradition...reasons"". The film gets a lot of laughs out of showing characters trying to get to grips with their weapon - from Fitch taking time out from the hunt to look up ""how to use a crossbow"" videos on YouTube to Emilie accidentally dispatching several maids due to her inability to handle her weapon.Another theme, although one not developed to the extent of the above, is religion. Le Bail, for example, is believed by the family to be a demonic figure, and his name, obviously enough, is an anagram of Belial, the demon from the Tanakh who would later form the basis for the Christian and Jewish depictions of Satan. On the other hand, Grace's name most likely references the idea of Divine grace. Elsewhere, the film depicts a pit of slaughtered goats, alluding to ritual animal sacrifice, a pre-Christian practice. Goats are also important in Christianity, especially in the practice of scapegoating, whereby a goat takes upon it the sins of the community and is cast into the desert, symbolically removing the taint of those sins (as per Leviticus 16:8-10). Along the same lines, Grace injures her hand on a nail, in a veiled reference to the Stigmata. However, whether or not we're supposed to interpret her as a Christ figure is hard to say as, although these references are interesting in isolation, they never really coalesce into anything concrete.Looking at some other problems, the film is, generally speaking, very slight; it's short and it's silly, and it's not going to change your life or lead you down the road of esoteric revolution. The violence is also (somewhat) problematic. The film maintains the stance that the rich are insane and the violence they mete out is contemptible. However, some of the biggest laughs are reserved for Emilie's accidental killing of the maids. And I have to admit, I found the way she haplessly dispatches two of them exceptionally funny. Also funny is that after one of the kills, the family are trying to have a conversation, which is continually interrupted by the gurgling of a mortally wounded maid; until Helene takes an axe to her head. And again, I have to admit, I laughed a lot at that scene, even though I recognised that the film was essentially asking the audience to see this violence as funny but some of the violence elsewhere as not so much. In this sense, it kind of wants to have its cake and eat it, picking and choosing when the audience should laugh; it takes Grace's stakes seriously but also encourages us to laugh at some (and only some) of the violence elsewhere, which is problematically inconsistent.Nevertheless, as I said, these scenes did make me laugh, so make of that what you will. Although Ready or Not is slight, its satirical ire is focused, even if the tendency towards irreverence doesn't always chime with the tone of the socio-political agenda. Allegorically skewering inherited wealth, marriage, tradition, even religion, the film suggest that with their atavistic rules and sense of entitlement, the Le Domas family embody the concept that old-money can lead to insularity from modernity. Offering us a match, the film suggests that perhaps the only way to deal with such irrelevancies and their sense of self-importance is to burn them to the ground. And it has a blast showing us why.","

"Ready or Not","neil-476","12 November 2020","When Grace marries into the Le Domas family, whose great wealth is from the sales of games, it's not a huge surprise to find out that a family game features on her wedding night. The game is Hide and Seek, and it turns out that the object is not so much to avoid being found, it's more to avoid being found and killed.This simple idea is played for all it's worth between a varied crop of family members and the necessarily resourceful Grace. The cast is low profile but very good, the film is nicely staged, there is a decent story and script, and the combination of bloodshed and laughs works well. This is not laugh-out-loud, but the steady stream of black comedy is constantly amusing.I really liked this.","

"Ready or Not","kluseba","23 August 2019","Ready or Not tries to be a mixture of a comedy and a horror movie and fails at both. The movie is never atmospheric, intense or scary enough to be a great horror movie. The film is never clever, surprising or vibrant enough to be an entertaining comedy movie. Even by poor b-movie standards, the story of this film is completely ridiculous in a way that it's almost insulting.If you were wondering why this film still deserves four points, the movie isn't entirely bad. The settings look great and especially the mansion where the sinister hide and seek game takes place is really gorgeous, including hidden hallways and elegant gardens. The movie features a few intense action scenes that make you root for the desperate lead character. The film has a fast pace and doesn't overstay its welcome with plodding storytelling. Lead actress Samara Weaving does her best with a poor script and has enough charisma to be the only great actress in this film.Ready or Not should be ignored since it's neither a gripping horror film nor a clever comedy. It's a shallow action film with a few gore elements. Movies like You're Next are similar in style but executed much better. The overtly positive reviews for Ready or Not show that expectations for horror movies have significantly decreased in an era of prequels, remakes, sequels and overall rehashed ideas. Refer to European or Asian cinema to find some creative horror movies these days.","

"Ready or Not","tmpsvita","7 November 2020","Never seen a movie so dumb and so smart at te same time.
So dumb cause well just read the story it's almost ridiculously stupid but at the same time so smart cause it knows what it is: pure fun entertainment. It never takes itself too seriously, it often jokes about its nature and it plays with it constantly especially with over the top dialogs and grotesque characters that fit perfectly into every, absurd, situation.
Situations where the lead character, the spouse (that Samara Weaving plays with tons of charisma), acts exactly how we all would have done even with smart decisions that rarely in an horror a protagonist takes.
The intelligence of this movie is its awareness of how to work perfectly, with enough weirdness, enough absurdity, enough charisma, enough blood (so much blood) and this makes it a very fun, enjoyable experience.","

Whether she gets killed or whether the mumbo jumbo truly exists is the highlight which gets bogged down by the lack of suspense or tension.
Rightly stated by BA_Harrison that the secret doors, rooms n servant tunnels r not covered properly.
The film does get a bit monotonous. The side characters get killed while our scream queen gets to survive a hell lottuva ordeal.
The maids r hot babes but they dont have much to do. None of the kills r memorable.
Watch out for aunt Helene with her comical hairstyle n a never give up attitude who is always ready with an axe.","

In fact, it is almost too funny to be a ""horror"" film, and although it was certainly gory, it had nowhere near the gore of most horror films. It was just right IF you are looking for a film to satisfy the horror-seeking fan in you and which makes you laugh at the same time. In my book, the best of both worlds.As for the reviews which mention violence towards women: get over it. I'm a woman and I detest women like these reviewers who demand to be seen as something more, but then fail to live up to being able to 'take it'. Grow up. You give real women like me a bad name by association.In closing, this is one I highly suggest you watch for yourselves and make up your own mind about, but go in knowing that there is humor in it and hardly any scares.

This is the third best movie of the year - not kidding.The movie manage to deliver all the blood, guts, and gory darkness you can possibly wish for together with plenty of laughs. This is horror, comedy and great acting in a movie which surprises and have one of the greatest ending of any movie I have seen in a long time.I do think that the movie feels too short, it should have been dragged out a little bit more - especially for us to get to know everyone a bit more so we feel more when they go poff or get their heads chopped off or shot or strangled or...
I also think a few things do not make total sense, however it is a horror drama comedy so I suppose that is not completely needed.
And sure, yes, it has a bit of that B-movie feel to it, the production value is not bad but it is not great either.
A few choices I wish was made different, but overall those are the negatives as I see them.I give it a 8/10, and I highly recommend.","

It's been a while since I've seen a horror film as satisfying (and as much fun) as this one.From the trailer, I expected a slapstick comedy horror, but this was not the case - thankfully. Although the film contains humor (that are actually funny and not slapstick), this was a nerve wrecking, suspenseful film that crawled in under my skin.Samara Weaving is FANTASTIC as Grace, the unsuspecting bride. The film might not have worked so well with another lead. She's the perfect lead for this film. 'Ready or Not' is a very different and refreshing take on the slasher genre. I also loved the setting in the big mansion. The film is wonderfully mysterious in the beginning and keeps you guessing until the finale. There's a few unexpected twists, as well.

"Ready or Not","GusherPop","30 November 2022","Grace (Samara Weaving) loves Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien) so much that she's tolerated the hoops through which his family have made her jump: Alcoholic wastrel Daniel (Adam Brody) hitting on her, mother Becky (Andie MacDowell) being somewhat cagey about her approval, sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) not even showing up in time for the ceremony, father Tony (Henry Czerny) outright voicing his displeasure at the girl's status and aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni) staring daggers at her from the moment they met. They're a bizarre bunch but Grace sees the light at the end of the tunnel now that they've all congregated at the Le Domas manor for the nuptials. However, and it's a big however, the film is charismatic and thrilling enough to bypass its shortcomings. Weaving makes for a very likable hero, with a broad comedic appeal, an every-girl clumsiness and sarcastic rejoinder for everything. In a better world, she'd be headlining comedies already. She makes for a likable action hero precisely because she knows and shows that the clothes don't fit her. In her tattered wedding dress, she fights for her life against everyone from her young nephews to the butler. Every wound she receive shows her that the backwards morality by which the rich live is so deeply ingrained that no amount of pleading could right the course. It's also her first clue that not even her beloved Alex will be able to get her out of this jam. She's not just fighting people, she's fighting tradition and the idea of family. By the time the games come to an end, ""Ready or Not"" has ceased to be about the rich and the poor. It's about a girl trying to survive a violent ordeal, which is potent enough for the moment you're watching the film, but in a climate in which politics can pull a film from a release schedule, now is not the time to hide.","

"Ready or Not","Bibliophile100","8 February 2023","As Katniss Everdeen said in the final book (and film) of The Hunger Games: ""There are much worse games to play"". The game in the comedy horror film Ready or Not...is definitely one of those ""worse games""!When a bride-to-be is married into a lavish, rich, and weird family, she soon discovers that they really stick to tradition...and tradition in this house, is anything but fun and games! Each time someone is welcomed into the family, they must play a game. For the bride, the game is hide and seek. All she has to do, is avoid being caught by dawn. Sounds easy right? Well, not with the family armed with ancient weapons and planning to perform a ritual on you it isn't! With the bride's new husband being the only reluctant and helpful one, she must outwit, out hide, and out smart the deranged and insane clan, until a supposable curse threatens to, supposably kill the family!I made a brilliant choice to see this film! And you will too, if you decide to play the game! The direction of Mr. Matt Bettinelli Olpin, and Mr. Tyler Gillett is excellent! I loved how the camera follows and moves with those who are running for their lives, and the still shots on lots of stuffed animal heads and pictures on the walls; these shots made the film seem a bit like a 90's or 80's era film, which I appreciated. The dark humor was pretty good too, but I especially loved the acting. I adored all the cast members and their splendid talent, especially, Samara Weaving, who played the traumatized, and frightened bride! As for the supposable death that will befall the family if dawn arrives...well, even they aren't sure if it's true! And that's part of the curious mystery!To any brides-to-be-wedded-into-a-new-family, be careful whose family you're welcomed to join, for as the words on the movie poster say: ""In-laws can be murder!""","

"Ready or Not","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","29 January 2023","A bride's wedding night becomes a nightmare.This is about class warfare which is here made literal. Thankfully, much like in real life, the 1% are impressively incompetent. Many of them will spend their entire lives failing upwards, like for example Donald Trump, who was President when this hit theatres. This doesn't have anyone who's a direct analogue for him, although some of the more notable things about him are spread across multiple, like terrible hair, overconfidence, etc.This manages to be one of the most tense and hilarious films I have ever seen. Like Jordan Peele, directorial duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett understand that today, it is necessary to subvert some of the horror tropes because otherwise we know what's coming. However, others have to be played straight, otherwise it becomes a parody, which is not the desired outcome.This features some bloody, gory, violent, disturbing content, and a lot of swearing. I recommend this to any progressive with a tough stomach. 8/10.","

"Ready or Not","aidanratesmovies","23 February 2020","Surprisingly smart, nimble, and by far an absolute blast- Ready or Not truly makes the best of its absurd premise, by not taking itself too seriously and finding a sheer sense of energy and balance between the humor and the chaos ensued. Samara Weaving leads a surprisingly great cast, with a performance that was absolutely perfect for the role involved. All other characters gave quite good performances as well, and to my surprise, none of their acting seemed too forced or taken too far. The script at times can prove to be a bit messy, but it is all in good fun, and by the time it is over, you will almost be impressed with the lengths it covered in such a short runtime. The pacing is quite good, and the cinematography is quite brilliant. For such a small budgeted film, you can't help but be blown away by the amount of quality involved in such a film. It simply shouldn't be and feel as it good as it is, and yet, it is true. Ready or Not is easily one of the best surprises of 2019, and proves that an absurd concept can be quite a good film, if having the right people involved.

What makes this so great is the general get to spot each laugh easily, not just its specific target audience.For a slasher film, Ready or Not deserves an applaud for its remarkable acting performances by the cast. Everyone shows their distinct characters from behaviour to costume that they are so entertaining to watch similar to that feeling when you get dozens of characters to choose from in a game.The lead character, the one who you will be rooting for is created in such a way that she is not dumb like in most movies. However, she is not smart either but the circumstances make her character safe from the trap of being a daft person. In other words, the movie does not unravel her intelligence nor her ludicrous manner.Also, the lead character has little to no character development. The fundamental question of her historical context and background is extremely lacking that we as the audience fail to connect with her as humanely as possible.The biggest complaint has got to be the rushing third act (final 30 minutes). The first two acts peel its layer off one by one steadily but the third act however loses its balance and goes downhill. They tried to do something completely different but it fails to satisfy the audience because we want something more pleasurable than what they have given us.Verdict: Ready or Not is a phenomenal gem that breaks the stigma free of 'slasher genre is dead'. However, it is not considered a masterpiece although seems very close due to its disastrous third act nature that falls short compared to the other two acts.","

"Ready or Not","BA_Harrison","26 September 2019","After Grace (Samara Weaving) marries into a wealthy family who have made their fortune creating board games, she finds that she must participate in a game of hide and seek before she will be properly accepted as one of the clan. But as Grace hides in the sprawling family mansion, her new in-laws tool up with a variety of weapons and set out to find and kill the young woman as part of a Satanic ritual.After watching Mayhem and The Babysitter, I found that I had developed a strong aversion to Samara Weaving's scream, a horrible warbling sound that sets my teeth in edge, but I was willing to try and put my animosity to one side for Ready or Not, the trailer for which looked like a lot of fun. I failed: her scream still got on my nerves, but as it happens, Weaving's warbling was just one of many reasons why I didn't enjoy this film.All of the characters are unlikable (Grace included) and unbelievable (husband Alex does a 180-degree personality flip), the plot goes nowhere for most of the film, the intended dark comedy falls horribly flat, the ending is predictable (reminding me a little of Drag Me To Hell), the location is underused (the servants tunnels, in particular, are totally wasted), and for a film given an 18 certificate for 'bloody violence and strong scenes of gore', there's very little in the way of inventive or graphic kills. Also, try as hard as you can, but you'll never convince me that it is possible to saw through a solid piece of hardwood with the chain on a pair of handcuffs.Save your money, save your time and save the strain on your ear drums (that scream!!!).3.5/10, generously rounded up to 4 for the creepy Hide and Seek song.","

"Ready or Not","jtindahouse","9 September 2019","The first thing you'll notice when watching 'Ready or Not' is how good the dialogue is. Horror movies are notorious for having terrible, bland, uninteresting dialogue, but the lines written for this film (and it does help that there are some very good actors delivering them to be fair) are superb. That sets the tone, and then the story takes over. I love how mysterious this movie is. You're always on edge because you feel like the film has more up its sleep than its showing you. This is a really well made horror movie.The cast of characters is just so great. There isn't a bland one amongst them. They all add something to the film and collectively make it so great. I would be remiss not to mention Samara Weaving in the main role. She is incredible. She is the horror character filmmakers dream of creating, because you can't help but root for her.Even though this was a great movie throughout, I couldn't help feeling the ending was going to play a large part in how people were going to feel about it. So did it stick the landing? It did so and more. The ending was handled brilliantly and was the icing on the cake to an already great film. I can't recommend 'Ready or Not' highly enough. See this film.","

Not even close. The useless main character was the definition of a ""damsel in distress"" needing someone to save them.She stumbled through the entire film, only surviving because of another character protecting her, the fact that her attackers were ridiculously inept, and pure blind luck, even in the end. Very disappointing. Very unsatisfying. Great cast though, but totally wasted on a weak script and direction.","

The film had a number of light moments with an ending that made me laugh. Melanie Scrofano plays Emilie who loves her cocaine and can't shoot straight.

"Ready or Not","Reviews_of_the_Dead","23 August 2019","This was a film that I was excited to check out as I caught part of the trailer. When I saw that it starred Samara Weaving that was when I knew I was on-board. The concept was something that had me intrigued as well. I hadn't seen this since the theater and am now giving it a second viewing as part of the Summer Series for the Podcast Under the Stairs. The synopsis is a bride's wedding night takes a sinister turn when her eccentric new in-laws force her to take part in a terrifying game.We start this film off with two little kids running away from someone. They are Daniel and Alex. Daniel has his brother hide in a closet and when he turns, a man asks for his help. He yells for others to come and when they do, the man is shot with arrows. He's then taken away while a woman named Helene breaks down.The film then alerts us that we shifting 30 years into the present. It is the wedding day of Grace (Weaving) to Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien). The Le Domas are a rich family that made their fortune off of board games. Daniel (Adam Brody) is an alcoholic, but still fairly close to his brother.Grace is scared the family doesn't like her, because of how rich and snooty they are. We get to know them through the pictures before the ceremony. The father is Tony (Henry Czerny) and he's married to Becky (Andie MacDowell). Daniel is married to Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) and they really don't get along. There's also Aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni) who keeps giving Grace the evil eye.As the night progresses, Alex finally reveals to his new bride that at midnight they are required to play a game. It is family tradition. Showing up just in time is Alex's sister Charity (Elyse Levesque) and her husband, Fitch (Kristian Bruun) with their two kids. They go into a room reserved for family only. There's a box that will decide the game they have to play that night. You can guess what it is from the title of the film. Grace doesn't take it too seriously, but her in-laws do. She has to survive until dawn, but they have a lot riding on her not making it.That should be enough of a recap without spoiling anything. I want to start this off by stating that this is a fun film. I had a blast with this one and it is actually quite hilarious. To be honest though, as the film progresses, I did see some deeper things here that I really enjoyed as well. Regardless, this is a fun, popcorn horror movie that doesn't shy away from the violence and the gore.The first of which to cover is the symbolism of Grace vs. The Le Domas. She is wearing a white wedding dress and they're wearing mostly dark clothes. I took this as she is good and them being the evil. It is even more interesting in this idea as some things get revealed as to why they have to play this game and what they think will happen if they don't complete what they need to do. I also like that she is wounded and her dress gets dirtier, she becomes stronger in fighting back. It is showing that change that comes over her as she grows harder.As it went on, I also picked up the idea of old traditions against the new ways of life. The Le Domas are old money. I like the idea how they earned it and they are trying to adhere to the rules of the game. The problem is that as it goes on, they get scared. They want to break tradition for the sake of winning. I thought this is a fitting look at the rich, who tend to bend the laws for their own gain. Going from there though, Alex is torn between protecting his new wife and the life that they could be making for themselves and his duty to his family. It is funny how inept this family is at hunting her. It definitely sounds like it was much easier as the ancestors were actually hunters. The deeper the generations go, the less skilled they are due to their easier upbringing.I do have to admit there is something that happened late in the film I could have done without after my first viewing. After listening to others talk about it and now giving it a second viewing, I don't have my issues there. It makes sense for what the movie is building to and that fear of what could happen if they fail.The pacing of the film though is something that is good as well. The film really just gets right into introducing the characters and getting to the game within the first half hour or so. I do like that we see a gradual change in Grace as she has to go to greater and greater lengths of surviving. There wasn't anything in the film that really bogged it down for me and I had fun all the way through.Something that was really good here was the acting. On a podcast I heard them compare Weaving to the horror Margot Robbie and I love this comparison. She is such a beautiful woman, but she is an amazing actress as well. I love how quirky her character is and she gives off that vibe that she is down to Earth without realizing how good looking she is. I love the change in her character as things happen to her. Brody is good here as well. There is an issue I have after this viewing with decisions this character makes. It feels like it is there to push the movie and doesn't make sense. Much like O'Brien, who is fine in his role, they're dealing with keeping up with traditional or finally breaking it to move on. I thought the rest of the family and staff was fitting for what was needed, they definitely rounded out the film and they all kind of bring their own humor to their specific roles.As for the effects of the film, I think there was some CGI, but to be honest I was stoked to see that they went practical. This film can be quite brutal at times and there are some things that Grace goes through that had me cringing. The CGI that was used looked good to me and I didn't notice it. There was good amount of blood and gore for me, so no complaints. The film is also shot very well as it does do some interesting angles so credit to the cinematography.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film, which I have to admit didn't really stand out. It did fit the scenes for what was needed and it helped to build tension. The only time I remember it was when they play this 'Hide and Seek' song. It is an old timey one and was quite eerie if I'm honest. I might see if I can find it actually. Regardless, I like the vibe that song gives.Now with that said, this film is definitely a fun one. I heard that, but I like to check things out for myself and it didn't disappoint. I thought it had an interesting concept, by taking a children's game and turning it deadly. I like the social commentary we are getting here and how it is plausible a family like this could get away with it. It is paced well, it built tension and I never got bored. I thought the acting from Weaving was good while the rest definitely rounded out the film for what is needed. Even the comedy worked for me as it doesn't take anything away from the movie or the tension. The effects were great, both the practical and the CGI. The soundtrack didn't stand out aside from one song, but I don't have a lot of complaints either. I'm not always the biggest horror/comedy fan, but there was something about this one that I liked. I thought this was good, bordering on being great for me.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.","

"Ready or Not","ivanmessimilos","6 July 2023","A modern horror that tries to be original and in one way succeeded, I congratulate them for that. It does not rely on jump scare scenes, which is a big plus, and there is a lot of dark humor, which is why the film can find its audience. The atmosphere, setting and visuals are excellent. However, the script is very bad, the plot of the film is minimal, and the characters seem to not exist, which ultimately bothered me. In the end we have a horror movie that entertained me and that doesn't rely on a formula like the vast majority of (bad) horror movies and that's why the movie gets a thumbs up from me.","

"Ready or Not","ferguson-6","21 August 2019","Greetings again from the darkness. Rich people aren't like you and me (unless you happen to be rich, in which case you fall into the first category). Their houses are different. Their vacations are different. Their family traditions are different. And that's where this latest from co-directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillet (known collectively with Producer Matt Villella as Radio Silence) really kicks in. Yes, the Le Domas estate is a maze of dark wood, music rooms, and hidden passages, but it's the wedding day tradition of post nuptial game night that provides the thrills, chills, shocks and laughter for about an hour and a half.Former foster child Grace (a star-making performance from Samara Weaving, THE BABYSITTER, THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING MO), is nervous and excited just before her wedding ceremony begins. Her husband to be is Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), the black sheep of an ultra-rich family, and the ceremony is being held within the lush garden and fountain grounds of the Le Domas mansion. Grace loves Alex and seems to have come to grips with his family: alcoholic brother Daniel (Adam Brody) who is always hitting on her, Daniel's gold-digger wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), father and patriarch Tony (Henry Czerny) who is outspoken in his belief that Grace isn't good enough for the family, mother and matriarch Becky (Andie MacDowell) who seems confused about her feelings towards Grace, crazy-eyed Aunt Helene (Nicky Guardagni) who seems to hate all living creatures, and coke-head sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) who, along with her husband Fitch (Kristian Bruun) couldn't even get to the ceremony on time.The above lineup of players is crucial because of what happens next. For wedding day game night, Grace draws the ""Hide and Seek"" card, rather than the much preferred checkers or Old Maid. There is a nice set up for this tradition which includes a Faustian deal made by Great Grandfather Le Domas. It's that deal that turns 'hide and seek' into 'hunt and kill'. Oh yeah, Alex forgot to warn Grace about the stakes and it's a blast to watch her transition as she figures it out. A torn wedding gown and yellow Chucks make up the visual of a bride fighting back against the antique weapons of crossbow, pocket pistol, elephant gun and battle-axe. You got it right - this family tradition is absolutely bonkers ... and bloody ... and deadly.As has become the favorite pastime of Hollywood recently, the film torches the ultra-rich. But if you can overlook the political posturings, you'll find a devilishly fun irreverent farcical zinger that offers some similarities to CLUE and SLEUTH, as well as many other games and movies. It has some of the look of SAW, but with significantly more tongue-in-cheek. In fact, dark comedy thriller might be a proper description, but you'll likely find yourself laughing more often than jumping in your seat. It's a wonderfully crafted and paced film that understands exactly what it is ... an instant classic Midnight Movie (along with this year's SATANIC PANIC from director Chelsea Stardust).Co-writers Guy Busick and Ryan Murphy take full advantage of the ominous setting and the wicked set-up, however, a minor quibble would be that the dialogue could have been a bit wittier. Most of the laughs come courtesy of the moment or the actors, and the banter falls just a little short. The prologue provides a 30 year ago flashback that cautions us for the ride we are about to take, and even offers some insight into the characters as much younger versions of themselves. The opening credit sequence is a beautifully staged and filmed running shot of some classic board games, informing us of the industry closely associated with the Le Domas 'dominion'.It must be noted that a studio recently postponed the theatrical release of THE HUNT because of the political backlash to their premise - rich people hunting poor people. While the themes of these two films could be considered similar, only the most extreme hard-liners could view READY OR NOT as anything more than good demented fun. Much of the primary production was filmed on location at the Parkwood Estate in Ontario, and it's the perfect setting for a family that chooses murder and fortune over all else. Two standouts on the soundtrack include ""The Hide and Seek Song"" by Headquarters Music and ""Love Me Tender"" by Stereo Jane (definitely not Elvis). For those who enjoy the twisted comedy approach to in-law jokes and violence, there are plenty of macabre moments that will deliver a smile ... till death do us part.","

Although hilarious and horror is something you usually wouldn't think to put together it just worked, reminded me of the original nightmare on elm street.The lead actress was great (especially at the end which was one I did not see coming and boy was it great). I do have to say in my opinion the star of the movie was Adam Brody, he played his character perfectly and just as you'd expect delivered some of the best/most sarcastic lines.
I have recommended everyone I know to go see this movie. Glad I saw it in theatres and will definitely be buying it so I can watch it at home!","

Now, ""Ready or Not"" looks at class structure through the same format. Much like how ""Crazy Rich Asians"" showed how rich people expect their children only to marry within their ""respectable"" range, this one shows how anyone from outside the country club crows is immediately ""the other"" to these people. And if the bride is the other, you can do whatever you want to her. Mind you, there are some shocking scenes. But it's all well done. Definitely see it.","

"Ready or Not","peeedeee-94281","31 August 2019","I was intrigued by this one because of all the positive reviews, even though the trailer didn't quite sell it for me. It looked like a cross between The Purge and Eyes Wide Shut.
Anyway, the movie starts of alright, the set up for what is about to come first with a flashback of the childhood of the boys, who then we see in present day is getting married to a blonde outsider played by Samara Weaving.
I actually liked her initially. She seemed like someone we could root for and hope would kick some serious butt. Ultimately, I found her unlikable, just like all the other characters in the film. What was it about her I didn't like? Well, she just doesn't sell the role very well. Is she bad ass or is she just lucky, everything seems to work out too conveniently for her, considering she has several people hunting for her. She doesn't appear to have any fighting skills. But the worst part: Her scream. Ugh, every time she did that yodeling scream, I couldn't stop thinking about Adam Sandler in the waterboy. Or tarzan lol. I've never heard an annoying scream like that before lol.
The story's pacing and tone is just all over the place. Much of the killing is accidental, nothing happens due to skill. There were too many predictable moments, like that 'goat pit' or whatever they called it that scene was too obvious where it was going. And clearly the family didn't care about piling bodies out in the open?!
And the swearing was terrible. I'm no prude, and I look a good f word in the right place, but this movie was mainly filled with unfunny moments where the characters keep saying wtf over and over. The dialogue really needed improving.
The ending was kind of funny, but ultimately, unsatisfying. It really didn't make any sense either.
Overall, this movie was just okay, I'd recommend watching it on Netflix. I watched for a discount price so I can't complain. I give it 2 marks for the reasonably good CGI gore in a few places, but that's about it.","

"Ready or Not","abhijith-alpha","2 May 2020","READY OR NOT: A REVIEWThe movie is about a young woman marrying into a rich and eccentric family, who force her to play a deadly game on the wedding night to be accepted into it. Samara Weaving plays the poor bride who fell in love with a rich guy, who discovers, to her shock, that her in-laws want to kill her before the sun rises on her wedding night.The idea isn't exactly original. The direction is somewhat listless and tries to rely heavily on horror movie tropes. The actors try to make it convincing but this is a group collected on their good looks more than their abilities. Compounding the issue, the weak screenplay and weird lighting and colour grading saps the performance out of even a seasoned veteran like Andie MacDowell, the most well known among the cast. This movie has bits and parts that work for it, but overall it was a letdown. The twists and turns of the scripts were telegraphed miles before they arrived; the physical comedy and horror wasn't distinct enough to compensate for the unoriginality; the character motivations were predictable and overall falls flat.Weaving tries her best, one of the young actors with good screen presence. Her performance is caught between the unlucky young woman running from an unfair situation and the vengeful bride a la Kill Bill. But her strong screen presence is wasted here in script indecision as she shifts back and forth between these two personas too many times to weaken the arc. Surprisingly, Adam Brody, whose character started off as the stock irresponsible brother, is the most realized character in the movie, and was the only one who held my interest every time he was on screen. His inner turmoil, the wrestling between emotions of guilt and shame, and loyalty to the family, is a good example of an actor making the best out of the limited range his script originally allowed him to do.Most movie tropes are present in ""Ready or Not"", the lucky girl, the sensitive rich guy who hates his rich family, the sneering matriarch, the charismatic and scenery chewing dad, the practical and in-charge mom, perpetually drunk brother, in-laws varyingly ambitious to spoilt, professionally creepy family butler and the unfortunate maidservants. Unfortunately the director seems to have stopped halfway between making the film a truly great horror film that also provides scathing social commentary. The movie seems to have settled into a middle path between proper satire and shallow commentary on the state of the world. Considering how much the ideas of the callousness of the rich towards the less privileged have been expressed well in many horror movies, and the overall script had the wherewithal to deliver it, this movie falls short for me. Sometimes, fun and gore, packaged somewhat competently, isn't enough for me to rate a movie good. This movie is good, but only by a small margin. I wouldn't watch it again.FINAL THOUGHTS
What a waste of an opportunity. All the ingredients where there, just not in the right amounts.Andie MacDowell looks weird. I blame the editing and the lighting.Adam Brody is really good.Some of the cinematography is really good. The inside of the mansion, in many scenes, is simply beautiful.RATING 5.5/10","

"Ready or Not","HafizhMaulana21","5 March 2023","When a family wedding turns into a deadly game, a bride must survive before dawn.Ready or Not, a title that strongly describes how deadly the game is in this film. A game of hide and seek that is displayed is gruesome and brutal. And of course it is very bloody. Ready or Not gives quite a different sense of mystery thriller. With the combination of comedy, it certainly adds to the strength of this film, which indeed throughout the film does not provide much attention that is suspenseful continuously. Many scenes are filled with dark comedy stories. The plot of the story feels ups and downs with conflicts that do not come continuously. The film gives a lot of room to combine thriller, mystery and comedy so that the impression of conflict does not immediately strengthen in some acts. Moreover, Ready or Not leaves no sense of horror and sadism in the film. Some scenes feature an overly graphic depiction of the gruesome and deadly game.","

"Ready or Not","donttouchmeprimate","14 December 2019","-After eating one of those festive ""Halloween"" burgers that fast food establishments do every year.Very simple plot with a great cast. Of course this is a slasher flick so expect some intense moments mixed in with some equally awful writing when it comes to logical decisions, but it's full of story and some very funny moments.It's a film I can see myself putting on again at some point. So all in all. It's pretty good for what it is.

"Ready or Not","peterp-450-298716","17 December 2019","So, at midnight you have to play a game.
It's just something we do when someone new joins the family.I have to revise my opinion about the horror/comedy cross-over urgently after seeing ""Monster Party"" and ""The dead don't die"" this year. ""Ready or not"" is yet another film that pleasantly surprised me. Really. I had a great time watching this movie. And not only because the lead actress Samara Weaving looks appetizing, but also because of the entertaining content. I appreciated the morbid black humor as well. It's not such absurd humor as in ""The dead don't die"". But the slapstick-like events that were used in it, resulted in a spontaneous chuckle sometimes. There were also quite a few bloody scenes in it. In short, it was fun watching this horror flick.And all because of playing an innocent game of ""hide and seek"". Grace (Samara Weaving) chose that on her wedding night by pulling a card out of a wooden box. Apparently, the Le Domas family, who made their fortune in the board gaming world, has a recurring family tradition at weddings. So the moment Grace got a wedding ring from Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), her brand new husband, she unknowingly became part of this tradition. So instead of playing a game of hanky-panky and frolicking in the old-fashioned-looking four-poster bed, the wedding couple is requested to go to the family room to play an old-fashioned board game. What Grace doesn't realize is that there's one special card that can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the evening. Guess what. Yep indeed, she draws the card in question.It was not only the course of the story I found enormously fascinating and ingenious. Also, the setting where it all took place was beautiful to see. A huge Victorian house, full of dark corners and niches. Such a huge villa that suits a wealthy family like Le Domas perfectly. Full of wood paneling, majestic staircases, and richly decorated corridors. As a child, you could easily get lost there. And that's where the innocent ""hide and seek"" takes place. At the beginning Grace enthusiastically participates. Until she realizes that nobody from the Le Domas family starts the countdown and starts shouting ""Ready or Not, Here I come"" (hence the film title). Instead, this insane family has armed itself with old, primitive weapons and starts hunting her.The most hilarious thing about the film is the family members themselves. All of them are cartoonish, caricatural characters. From the authoritarian somewhat empty-headed paterfamilias Tony (Henry Czerny) and his wife Becky (Andie MacDowell) to the scary-looking, shrewish aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni). The latter is the most extreme character. She looks as if she's a member of a satanic cult with her purple suit, black nail polish and upright Cruella de Vil hairstyle. And when you see her running through the corridors, screaming frantically and waving with a huge lumberjack's ax, the picture is complete. Add a bunch of other family members to it, such as the alcoholic son Daniel (Adam Brody) and his cheeky wife Charity (Elyse Levesque). The coke-addicted daughter Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) and her cowardly husband Fitch (Kristian Bruun). And of course the butler should not be missing. Together they form a colorful ""Adam's Family"" -like collective.Finally something about the horror part. Even though the overall atmosphere is rather lighthearted and caricatural, the hardcore horror fanatic will enjoy certain moments. This gothic horror is filled with a few gory and bloody scenes while maintaining an exciting pace. I found the part in the barn particularly successful and at the same time extremely funny. You see the nail. You see the hole in a hand. And you immediately know how these two facts will be linked. Sublime. And even though you know where it's going, I was surprised by the denouement. A denouement that would make Quentin Tarantino jealous. And I suppose they wanted to show how huge the gap is between rich and poor. In the end, this was just a minor side issue. ""Ready or not"" is perhaps the cruel version of the Cinderella fairy tale. But ultimate entertainment was the main goal here. And they certainly have succeeded in that for me.More reviews here: movie-freak.be","

"Ready or Not","Carycomic","28 August 2019","I had a choice between two movies on this rainy afternoon. DORA THE EXPLORER...or READY OR NOT. D.T.E. started sooner, so I chose that one.Boy! Was that a mistake.After twenty-five minutes of listening to Dora breaking the Fourth Wall, like an adolescent poor's man version of Deadpool, I walked out of the theater and bought a ticket to R. O. N. A mixed blessing, to say the least. But, on the bright side I was able to sit through the entirety of it. And, even better, I was the only one in the audience during the matinee I chose! So, I was able to make slightly sarcastic comments, half out loud, without being shushed by other movie-goers.A good thing, too.The first half of this film is only mildly amusing...and definitely nowhere near as suspenseful as the second half. I mean, just the opening shot of all those board games (and one in particular) gives you a pretty good idea what the back story for this weirdo family is going to be!Then, there's all the swearing.Were the writers getting paid by the profanity? I haven't heard that many F-bombs dropped since the original CABIN FEVER! Which, if memory serves, I accused the cast thereof of trying to sound like vintage Robert Deniro...with none of his acting talent. Well, the same holds true for most of the cast of R.O.N. The only notable exceptions are Samara Weaving, who's totally new to me (and totally believable as the unexpectedly feisty Grace); and Andie McDowell, the only recognizably big name in the cast.In summary, then, I give this five stars (four stars better than JENNIFER'S BODY). As in; not bad! But, I've definitely seen comparatively scarier.","

"Ready or Not","Breumaster","15 February 2020","The Movies is not as comedic as the trailer makes believe into. But the movie sure has it's comedic moments. I expected a little more story, action or comedic fun, but after viewing the movie, I can say that it is pretty more bloody and gory than expected. The R-rating fits for today, 15 years ago it would have been a nc-17-rating. But I also noticed that most of the hunting scenes were somehow generic. The pure hunt had no fresh ideas or turns in it. There are many similar hunting stories like this on on the market. Just think on 'Surviving the Game' or 'The Collector', but this one has an occult background, which makes it interesting. The setting in the house looks worthy, the light and camera professional. The climax has some very funny moments, we had a bizarre laugh at. All in all, it's a kinky ending. I would consider it as a recommendation for people who like dark humor and sarcasm.","

"Ready or Not","jadepietro","4 September 2019","GRADE: D+THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: This newlywed game is an awful horror film that dispatches its dark comedy origins more quickly than its bloody victims.JIM'S REVIEW: Summer 2019 was the bleakest of times...hurricanes destroying the lives of many survivors, mass shootings with no gun regulation in sight, a roller-coaster of a economy due to unnecessary trade wars, an unhinged president...and one of the most disappointing movie roster to ever (dis)grace the tarnishing silver screen. Take your pick, which was the worst...all were bad news. Let us beg the gods above that September brings with it an autumnal bounty of good news.That said, my first fall film experience is Ready or Not, a slice-and dice horror send-up about the trials and tribulations of matrimonial bliss when one is confronted with in-laws whose sole purpose is to play a game I would like to called Kill the Bride. This wealthy family has a tradition of playing games like hide-and-seek on one's wedding night to welcome the newest member to the family. So let the games begin, of course, at the stroke of midnight.Yes, you might say that the premise is very far-fetched and ludicrous. You could say that I knew what I was about to see from the trailer. And I would wholeheartedly agree with your statements. But my hopes as a reviewer were still high, if a bit naive as our plucky heroine, that this strange little movie might have a sharp (literally) comic edge about its satirical subject, playing up the dark humor and downplaying the gore. No. Instead it was just a very bloody version of Clue with various killings and assorted weapons used by deranged members of this dysfunctional family in the conservatory or in the dining room. (Everyone, of course, has the poorest of aim, little vision, or any semblance of reality or character development. And now, I'm talking about the directors and its screenwriters. Let's place the blame directly at them: Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillert never find the right tone in this macabre mishmash and writers Guy Busick and Ryan Murphy only celebrate predictability with their contrived concept and just cannot create believable characters or clever dialog. The twist ending is more absurd than expected and a real letdown.)The actors range from deserving of better material to find another job ASAP. Samara Weaving (a Margot Robbie wannabe) plays Grace, the woeful bride. At least, this actress has some screen presence as does Mark O'Brien as Alex, the hapless groom. One actually pities this talented actors who deserve a better way to make a living, As Alex's brother, David, Adam Brody has his moments but is rather bland. From there, it gets worse: Henry Czerny, usually a fine character actor, is at his hammiest and has done far better work than this shlock suggests. That Andie MacDowell is part of this misfire only adds to the disappointment and confirms that what happens to actresses in their elder years does indeed qualify for elder abuse. Granted, the script is a mess and it is difficult to tell if it is the fault of the actors or the badly-written characters they play.The rest of the supporting cast is ghastly in their roles and they appear to come off as strictly amateurs in this movie. They all seem to be directed to perform like a live action Addams Family knock-offs without the make-up or wit, although Nicky Guadagni as Aunt Helene is cartoonish enough. (Some advice to all of the the ensemble: Your dedication to your craft is admirable. But, perhaps, your desperation to be a part of this biz we call show outweighs your better judgement. Ask yourself if you really want a film like this to be part of your legacy when doing your next venture. Plus, find a better agent.)For the record, Grace's white wedding gown turns a nice shade of deep crimson by the film's third act, if you care by then. (And those final scenes are unintentional laughable as the film veers into supernatural territory.) The body count continues to rise as servants and kin are dispatched with glee. The violence ranges from stabbings, impalements, beheadings, and gruesome shootings. The weapons include axes, cross-bows, rifles, pistols, and knives.How this movie merited some critical praise (and it did) is baffling! The suspense is nil, with nary a scare or a laugh, although the directors have an obsession for close-up gore and torture, believing that blood-drenched corpses gurgling their last gasps of life constitutes a horror film nowadays. Need I say more.Ready or Not is more not than ready. No RSVP is needed. Just avoid this wedding party at all costs.Ah, Autumn! Have you already forsaken me!","

"Ready or Not","edicionccq","24 November 2019","""Ready or Not"" it's a weird movie. The movie is full of strange choices from the writers.
At first the movie starts really good. Excellent pacing, the plot is simple but it works, the jokes are funny and the fear is present. But the second half of the movie is just weird; there are a lot of changes in the way things developed. Some moments are so good for the horror aspect but then a joke appears all of a sudden. If you ignore the pacing of that half and the weird choice for the ending this is a good movie.The best parts of this movie are the characters. Every single one of them is pretty well established and the way they act is coherent with their personalities. Most of the characters, that we could consider the villains, are funny and has their reasons to do what they do and it's kind of convincing. The leading character is pretty good. You want her to win but also you want to see her suffer and fighting for his life. And believe, she will really fight for her life.The conclusion is ""Ready or Not"" is a weird black comedy with slasher. It contains gore and funny characters. The twists are decent and if you are into dark humor in killing, this will be good for you.","

"Ready or Not","BandSAboutMovies","24 August 2019","Marriage - especially the ceremony itself - can be terrifying. The best horror movies take a frightening moment in our lives and show how ""what's the worst that can happen"" explodes outward into a spiraling miasma of sheer madness. In a year sadly bereft of many great - or even halfway decent - horror films, Ready Or Not has arrived to squarely punch you right in the face and spit blood in your eye.For generations, the wealthy Le Domas family has remained in power by conducting a ritual on the night that anyone new enters the family. Tonight, prodigal son Alex has returned home to marry Grace (the niece of Hugo Weaving, who also appeared in The Babysitter and Mayhem), an orphan who has been raised in foster homes.Years ago, the great-great-grandfather of the Le Domas family made a deal with Mr. Le Bail and the family must play one game - they're pretty much Hasbro in real life - at the end of the wedding ceremony. It could be something as simple as Old Maid. Yet it ends up being the worst card - Hide And Seek.Now, the entire Le Domas family is hunting down Grace, who only thinks that she's playing a game. Maid after maid gets caught in the crossfire and the entire extended family - children included - are armed, dangerous and after our heroine.Henry Czerny shines as Tony Le Domas, the crazed leader of the clan, and Andie McDowell is wonderful as his somewhat conflicted wife Becky. One of the relationships at the center of this film is between good brother Alex and bad sibling Daniel ((Adam Brody, Seth from The O.C.). Of course, this being horror, what is good and what is evil will change throughout this long night of the soul.There are parts of this film that aspire to be more than mere slasher or modern horror. That's a good thing. It may be me reading into things, but the scene where Grace escapes into the fields was reminiscent of the framing and pace of Suzy Kendall being chased in Sergio Martino's Torso. And without giving too much away, the close finally delivers on the levels of gore and supernatural menace that has been slowly hinted during the film's run time. Joyously, this feels like a movie with no dead spots, growing tighter and taunter as the slowly more blood-caked and torn wedding gown that Grace wears throughout.I have to single out Nicky Guadagni, who was in Cube, for her portrayal of Helena. The loss of her husband at the film's start has warped her into the twisted center of this family, despite what the male head would have you think. She's turned her loss into less than sacrifice and more of a reason for being. Drug addict sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano, the lead on SyFy's Wynonna Earp) is pretty great, too.So often, modern horror hasn't been certain how to combine humor and terror. Ready Or Not gets it right. Then again, I have a weird sense of humor, so I laughed joyously at moments that no one else found funny. Too bad - I would have preferred to see this in a much rougher theater than the comfortable place where it unspooled so that people would have been unafraid to scream and yell at the screen. After all, that's what movies are for.Ready Or Not was directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin (V/H/S) and Tyler Gillett (Devil's Due), who are part of the Radio Silence film collective. It was written by Guy Busick (Stan Against Evil) and Ryan Murphy (Minute's Until Midnight).I will spoil one part of the film. At the close, as Grace draws a drag of cigarette despite being covered in grime, gore, viscera and her own blood, there's an echo of a movie from the past, Heathers. That made me clap in the theater - despite the machinations of family, the man she loves and even fate, Grace is not going away without a fight. Her spirit is one that even the devil must sit up and take notice of - quite literally.","

"Ready or Not","cappiethadog","29 January 2020","The rich are different, Daniel(Adam Brody) admits as much to Grace(Samara Weaving), his sister-in-law for all of half a day. Daniel doesn't have what it takes to be a satanist, or a capitalist, for that matter. He lacks the killer instinct. ""Ready or Not"", directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, updates the ideology behind Ernest B. Schoedsack and Irving Pichel's ""The Most Dangerous Game"", in which Grace, the hunted, is clearly marked as the proletariat; not a relativistic object, an animal chosen by the hunter(Count Zaroff, played by Leslie Banks in the 1932 original), which happens to be human, because the normal rules of engagement need not be abided by if you're outside civilization's jurisdiction. The rich make their own moral universe. But Daniel is moral. He discovers his brother's wife in the pool room. The moral brother gives Grace a ten-second running start before he alerts the others, starting with Tony(Henry Czernas), his father, who is adamant about keeping the family's bloodline blue. The newlywed should have paid closer attention the underlying warning of her hubby's warning. Before Alex(Mark O'Brien) and Grace read their wedding vows, the groom says: ""I'm giving you an out,"" to his bride, who misreads the warning as being money-related. Grace misses the part where Alex never cracks a smile to reassure her that his apprehension is a joke. The family tradition is more sinister than she can imagine. As children, Daniel hid Alex in a closet the last time somebody had the misfortune to draw the dreaded ""Hide and Seek"" card. It was their Aunt Helene's husband, who died in a ritual sacrifice, but not before Becky(Andie McDowell), the boys' mother, let fly a strategically-placed arrow from her bow like an expert archer that kept Charles(Andrew Anthony) alive for the interim. The aunt(Nicky Guadagni), whose mien is suggestive of the proverbial woman with a grudge, has been waiting years for a night like this. Like Rosemary Woodhouse(Mia Farrow), wife of Guy(John Cassavetes), a struggling actor in Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"", Grace's unwavering belief that Alex will deliver her from evil leads to disillusionment. Although bad blood with his family led Alex to flee the LaDomas dominion, in the end, blood turns out to be thicker than water, as they say, because the gaming empire family's blood is bad, especially, the blood of the black sheep.Daniel was slightly taller than Alex on that fateful night. You could say that he was the ""high boy"", running interference between Alex and the destiny he'll learn of on his wedding night. A high boy, in the furniture sense of the word, in ""Rosemary's Baby"", has been moved. Mr. Nicklas(Elisha Cook), the Bramford apartment building landlord, stands aghast; he knows that a hall closet exists behind the hulking cabinet. Guy rubs his face, as if annoyed at the old man for being so observant. But isn't this the first time he laid eyes on this place? Rosemary points at the outline. This annoys Guy, too. Rosemary would never guess that her husband's exasperation pertains not just to the landlord, who enlists him as a furniture mover, but because her deducing skills make them collaborators against a conspiracy plot that will become self-evident in the near-future. Landlord and wife have no idea what they just stumbled upon. The question of whether Guy's association with the cultists began that night as dinner guests of their neighbors, the Castevets(Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon), or a long-standing one which resumed after a lengthy hiatus, was an open-ended one. Arguably, ""Ready or Not"" resolves this ambiguity, due to the film's resemblance in form and content. Guy knows Roman Castenet and his wife Minnie. He also knows about the ghastly history of that gothic piece of 19th century architecture. Hutch(Maurice Evans), their old landlord, is only wasting his breath. Like Grace's husband, Guy probably wanted a normal life. Slitting goat necks, a LaDomas family tradition since grandfather cut a deal with fellow traveler LeBail, the devil in disguise, chased Alex away, but relative poverty brought the prodigal son back to the fold, gambling that Grace wouldn't pull the bad card. Being one of the common people didn't suit him. Slitting goat necks notwithstanding, satanism is a necessary evil Alex willingly accepts as the cost of being a trustee to the family fortune. Faustian pacts are nefarious deals, naughty by nature, that are made to either procure money, or in the case of ""Rosemary's Baby"", fame; two drugs more potent than love, and worth killing over, for some. Guy, as well, ventured out on his own, wanting to prove himself as a stage actor with the right stuff, all the while knowing that if he couldn't establish himself legitimately, enlisting the help of Roman Castevet and his dark arts as a last resort was an option. An actor, the man who beat Guy out for the starring role in a play, goes blind suddenly, and the play's director calls his second choice to see if he'd be interested. As payment, the husband promises the cultists a baby, albeit with some acquiescence. A son, born stillborn, Rosemary is told, she refutes, not after the sound of crying comes emitting through those thin walls on a nightly basis. The dislocated high boy, refashioned into a barricade, Rosemary remembers, then quickly diagnoses, must block a secret passageway to her next-door satanists.Emilie LaDomas(Melanie Scrofano), already on the hook for two accidental kills; a governess and maid, makes it a trifecta of collateral damage when she shoots Daniel, her good brother. Without his ""tall boy"", Alex comes out of the closet, so to speak, and learns the truth about what sort of devilry he's up against, like Rosemary. She can tell by looking at her son's eyes that Guy isn't the father: Lucifer is. On the night of the impregnation ceremony, when that dessert with the chalky undertaste Minnie laced with drugs starts to have an effect on Rosemary's cognitive functions, Guy mocks his wife for added dissonance, relaying news from the black and white television about the pope's visit to Yankee Stadium. Rosemary is Catholic. His words are coded: Your god can't help you. The go-between can't help you. The Richard Connell short story ""The Hounds of Zaroff"", adapted into ""The Most Dangerous Game"" for the screen, is applicable. Guy could be a stand-in for the Count, who hunts her in baroque fashion. No bow and arrow, no gun: Guy depends on Rosemary's unconditional love for him as a weapon. The old men and women, nude throughout Adrian's conception, are the hounds. Does she fight back? No. Love is the most dangerous game. Rosemary joins the cult, agreeing with Roman that she should ""be a real mother"" to her half-humanoid son. God or Lucifer, Rosemary doesn't really choose either one. What ""Rosemary's Baby"" conveys is that she's possessed by her husband, choosing his obtuse convolutions to isolate her against the practical advice of cosmopolitan girlfriends, who all agree that Dr. Saperstein(Ralph Bellamy) is a quack. Go to Dr. Hill(Charles Grodin) they persist. But the internal physical pain, no matter how intense, because of her religiosity, the satanists know that Rosemary, their human game, will no doubt carry the little devil to full-term. Grace, on the other hand, despite her name, is a secularist; a position, guessed at, since the potty-mouthed young woman expresses no misgivings about her wedding being held outside the sanctity of a church. Since Becky, the groom's mother, gave birth to her husband, LeBail's heir apparent, the ""new me"", a moniker, previously though to have referenced the two women's shared experience of coming from humble stock, now means, the audience realizes, that the child she dams will carry the title of ""Grace's Baby"", second in succession to the LaDomas fortune and the throne of a fallen angel. With Daniel no longer alive to protect his younger brother, Alex learns that it was always his destiny to lead the family, which involves more than sitting goat necks. He has to sacrifice Grace. Does she fight back. Hell, yeah.Bob(Joel McCrea), the lone survivor of a yacht explosion at sea, makes it ashore on a small island overseen by a madman, in ""The Most Dangerous Game"", proving once again that the rich are different. Bob, a published author, who writes books about big game hunting, leads Count Zaroff to believe he has found a kindred spirit; a teammate instead of opponent. Zaroff, a Bolshevik, who owns the private island, dangles the proposition of hunting his two remaining guests: Martin(Robert Armstrong) and his sister Eve(Fay Wray). Bob flatly turns down the offer. Count Zaroff calls this game ""outdoor chess"" when it's Bob and Eve's turn to play. Bob gets a knife. Eve gets nothing to counter their common enemy. This outdoor chess Zaroff invented is a game meant for two human animals, mano a mano. The Count deeming Bob as a formidable opponent. With the woman, he's playing checkers.""I will play the ***t out of checkers,"" Grace declares before she goes downstairs. By the break of dawn, she gets to the other side of the board. The winner doesn't say: ""King me,"" but that's exactly what Grace does.","

This is the game each new member of the family has to play to insure its future prosperity. Usually the game is harmless, but Grace pulls out ""Hide and Seek"", which means her in-laws are supposed to hunt her down and murder her before sunrise...READY OR NOT Is a tongue in cheek horror movie, as satirical as it is terrifying. Playing with the concept of murderous in-laws it shows to what extreme one has to go through to belong to a new family. Samara Weaver fills the shoes of a fragile heroine who quickly learns survival skills in a labyrinthine gothic mansion, when like many newly weds she realises there's no happily ever after.The film has a perfect pacing and a great cast, each of them with some memorable idiosyncrasies that make them very much alive. Adam Brody, a divided brother of the groom is a show stealer, and Andy MacDowell shines as the family matriarch and a reluctant killer. Her character's transformation in the film is the most interesting one.The soundtrack by Bryan Tyler is incredible and is the heart and soul of the film. It also makes a great stand alone listen.READY OR NOT has enough suspense murders and gore to satisfy a seasoned horror movie lover and its cleverness is what makes you talk after the credits finish rolling.

I should say Ready Or Not is a best example of horror movie with violence and horrifiying tensed scenes and not without jump scares.are you READY OR NOT???","

The game picked this time is 'hide and seek', this is a wedding night initiation for the rich family.The game turns out to be a very violent and gory fight for survival, the bide must die before dawn or all the family will perish. It looks like they ran out of ideas as the ending is a very abrupt spray of blood and guts everywhere.A very simple plot, and not funny enough to be a comedy, don't bother - sorry!","

"Ready or Not","Anurag-Shetty","15 September 2019","Ready or Not tells the story of Grace(Samara Weaving). After getting married, Grace's wedding night takes a malevolent turn, when her in-laws force her to take part in a horrifying game.Ready or Not is a highly entertaining film. Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett have perfectly blended comedy with thriller & horror elements. The tense atmosphere has been maintained throughout, despite all the comedy. The performances are the highlight of the movie. Samara Weaving is the star of the show as Grace. Weaving gives us the performance of a lifetime, as the lead character. Adam Brody is spectacular as Daniel Le Domas. Mark O'Brien is outstanding as Alex Le Domas. Henry Czerny is brilliant as Tony Le Domas. Andie MacDowell is superb as Becky Le Domas. Melanie Scrofano is excellent as Emilie. Kristian Bruun is hilarious as Fitch Bradley. Nicky Guadagni is fantastic as Aunt Helene. Elyse Levesque is great as Charity Le Domas. The supporting cast is impressive. Ready or Not is worth a watch for horror/thriller/comedy fans. This film is definitely one of a kind, in many ways.","

"Ready or Not","ThomasDrufke","4 September 2019","A great trailer can really shape your expectations about a movie. What was initially thought of (and pitched) as merely a hide and seek horror film, there was no real reason to get excited about Ready or Not. But oh boy did that trailer (and the marketing campaign overall) completely shift my hopes for the film. And luckily, the film is exactly what the marketing presents, endlessly fun, at times hilarious, and a devilishly delightful thriller vibe throughout. Oh, and Samara Weaving is an absolute star in the making, and far better than Margot Robbie 1a, which is what I initially referred to her as. One of the best films of the year, and a great way to end the summer.9.0/10","

You think you're ready, but you're not, it's wild. Weaving does a great job as the main character, she's put through her paces and just keeps moving (and looks pretty badass doing it!). I really enjoyed the quirky nature of the dialogue and acting. You're laughing one minute, then gasping the next. They make no bones about the premise and each character plays their part beautifully. The ending is a bit weird, but in context it couldn't have ended any better. Really something.","

"Ready or Not","Groverdox","23 December 2019","""Ready or Not"" is one of those movies you don't need to watch. If you know what it's about, you can pretty much imagine the whole thing. You've probably got an imagination at least as good as the filmmakers'.I only really watched the movie for the beautiful Miss Weaving, and I'm not sure if her character really made it worth watching. It was also pretty cool seeing Andie McDowell as a villain.But other than that, I was just waiting for it to end. Even the movie's sub-par gore is predictable. What a surprise, for example, that the protagonist suffers a wound mid way, that would probably see her bleed to death within moments in real life... and then goes the rest of the movie with it without even fainting from loss of blood.The movie is born to be a thriller in the Agatha Christie mould but makes a final, misguided detour into horror movie territory in the final act, as though the filmmakers realised they needed to somehow justify the movie's ridiculous premise, and only the supernatural could really do that.It seems like it was made up as they went along, which makes it a waste of their time, as well as ours.","

"Ready or Not","JohnDeSando","4 September 2019","""Till death do us part.""I could have avoided one of my failed marriage if I had never married into her family in the first place. However, at that time, I never thought to look at the family to see the warning signs.In Ready or Not, young Grace (Samara Weaving) is ready to marry Alex (Mark O'Brien) not knowing the La Domas family, although their being super wealthy from board games might help her over the ignorance. As they are scheduled to play an initiation game of Hide and Seek for her, it becomes clear it's deadly enough to demand her life before dawn or they all die.Elements of Get Out, Clue, and Rosemary's Baby help make Ready or Not one of the best horror movies of the year with a little scare for everyone. If an audience is interested in blood and surprise, with a slight bit of the supernatural, then this macabre fest is for them.If, however, like me, an audience looks for social and cultural commentary in addition to the scares, then this nervous experience more than fulfills that requirement. The film shows two ways a bride should be on alert: 1. Wealth has a way of making the wealthy unpredictable, self-centered, and wicked. 2. Why a fiancé has estranged himself from his family is an important piece of information that may save a bride's life.The usual jump-scare tropes and malicious surprises make Ready or Not a delight for the normal horror fan. The cautionary-tale about knowing thy fiancé's family is universally true here. The over-the-top gore that induces laughs makes this film a joy to any filmgoer who can suspend disbelief and love this genre for its ability to teach about life's ironies and dark sides.","

"Ready or Not","kirbylee70-599-526179","17 December 2019","A number of movies that once qualified to be called thrillers now fall under the guise of horror films. These films have viewers on the edge of their seats waiting to see what will take place, filled with jumps and scares aplenty. What makes them horror films are the morbid things that take place in the film. READY OR NOT is such a film.Former foster child Grace (Samara Weaving) marries into the Le Domas family after a whirlwind 18 month romance with son Alex (Mark O'Brien). Alex has been estranged from his wealthy family for some time now. They return to the family home for their marriage and all seems to be going well. Until the evening of the wedding Grace learns of something unexpected.The Le Domas family has made their wealth from the gaming industry. Begun years ago by Victor le Domas, he was provided with funds to start the company by a mysterious benefactor named Le Bail. Victor left behind a mysterious box and a demand of his family. When someone marries into the family they must play a game, determined by a card that the draw from the box. After hearing the story Grace draws her card and the game chosen is hide and seek.Grace runs off to hide with no idea of what is actually about to transpire. The family believes that if they don't follow the game to its end something terrible will transpire. What they haven't bothered telling Grace is that this game of hide and seek involves hunting her with weapons, the object to kill her before sunrise. If she survives, things move forward.As Grace hides the family arm themselves with various weapons. For most of them this is something new they've never experienced. While some are skilled others have no clue how to use the weapons they've been given. This becomes apparent when one of the family members is killed by mistake.A change in the game takes place when Grace is located by her husband Alex. He tells her what is going on and explains to her the object of the game. With his help the pair are hoping to survive the night and move on to become a happy couple. But with the number of family members hunting the odds are not in their favor.The movie sounds like a simple plot but is filled with tons of things that make it worth watching, in particular the dark comedy that many of the sequences lend themselves to. In particular is Aunt Helene who has a scowl on her face from start to finish. She seems the most suited for the role of hunting and seems to take relish in what transpires. What she does to the help is guaranteed to provide a laugh for those with an offbeat sense of humor.Another funny moments has the family arguing about whether or not to use the security cameras seen throughout the house. The cameras are not to be used during the game but once the first person is killed they think twice about using them. Aunt Helene complains telling them they have no sense of tradition.The film has a wonderful look to it, a sort of brownish haze that adds to the atmosphere of the film. The sets are amazing with a fantastic looking old style mansion for the events to take place in. The cinematography is also extremely well done allowing scenes in the dark just enough light for things taking place to be seen, a problem with many movies that take place at night.The acting here is wonderful as well with each character turning in wonderful performances. To be able to play these roles with a straight face takes some acting chops. Perhaps outstanding among them is Henry Czerny as the head of the family. His ability to play his role as serious as he does while in the face of absurdity is hilarious. Samara Weaving as Grace is worthwhile too, showing the right amount of shock and resilience the role requires. And Andie McDowell is fantastic in the role of the mother here, a role that most would never expect her to play.READY OR NOT is not the type of movie that everyone will have fun with but if your sense of humor runs the dark side then this will be a movie not to miss. It's gruesome and funny at the same time and that for me is something that rarely works. This time it does.","

"Ready or Not","vengeance20","2 September 2019","Just seen this tonight at a Scream Unseen event at my local cinema & found it an epic watch!The films story-line is simple. A young woman, Grace, marry s into a rich family who have an annual tradition in which any new family member must play a game at midnight in order to seal the deal in a sense. But Grace picks that one game, Hide & Seek, she at first laughs & plays along but then soon realises its not the typical innocent game she thought it was. The rest of the film sees Grace in a fight for survival as she becomes caught in a deadly game of cat & mouse.I already knew what the film was going be like story-line wise, the trailer gives that away in the first 20 seconds alone. But what the twist of the film was going to be & how violent, was yet to be seen!It's rare in cinema now that you get an 18+ at all, never mind an 18+ horror! This film didn't disappoint & kept me locked from start to finish! The gore & kills were epic & didn't cease to amaze me! The humour was funny too, though I wouldn't say there was enough in it to justify the ""Black Comedy"" genre as it was mostly serious than anything else.The ending however though gory was a little half & half, but you'll have to see for yourself in order to know where I'm coming from with that one...!But overall this film was a nice 100 minute gory fest that reminds me of The Purge mixed with Downton Abbey! 9/10","

It's EXACTLY as described, but better. It doesn't make the mistake of lumbering on for 2 hours, but is a quick watch.A note for violence: some reviews comment that it is extremely gory. I did not find this to be the case. It is quite bloody, but for the most part, it's tame enough to allow folks who can't handle tons of gore to watch it, but meaty enough for gorehounds to enjoy it.

I laughed a hell of a lot, and all of the humor in it is kind of dark, but it works very well. There's a lot of scary moments, but not really any jump scares which is good. Scary films, at least recently, have relied way too much on jump scares. This one doesn't, and it's still scary. But the film balances the horror and humor very well.Why it all works is because of the actors. They're all amazing, actually, especially the main actress Samara Weaving. I don't think I've ever seen a performance as realistic as hers. She can really act like she's scared, and her screams are top-notch.Honestly, I would love to see a prequel, or a sequel that delves deeper into the mythology of it all. I would definitely recommend this to everyone who loves horror and/or dark humor. It's a refreshing horror film, so go watch it!","

"Ready or Not","tabuno","9 September 2019","In the same style as Kate Winslet's The Dressmaker (2016) and Nicole Kidman's Dogville (2004), this very dark comedy horror movie maintains the difficult balance between grotesque and weirdly appealing immorality of evil death. The script and director successfully maintain a difficult but nicely paced movie along with an amazing absence of overly imbued supernatural features. Instead Ready or Not holds the audience attention more for its humanness than monsterness. The lead character played by Samara Weaving is allowed to perform with a more realistic and Hitchcockian motif using scary elements of timing, audience expectation, well-deserved cinematography, and music to create a technically well-crafted scary movie. For the most part, the movie is well-tied together with a compelling sprinkle of twists and delicious sordidness. Except for perhaps a tinge of the loss of the fun balance of darkness and comedy towards the last half of the movie, it still ends with a nice sense of humor","

Grace (Samantha Weaving) is marrying into the wealthy Le Domas family. On her wedding night she participates in a family ritual, drawing a card from a box to decide on the game to be played. She chooses Hide & Seek. Soon she is fighting for her life. An ancestor of the Le Domas family had made a deal with Mr Le Bail (the Devil) which brought him great wealth- at a cost.A gruesome chase ensues with maid's being accidentally shot with crossbows and crushed in dumbwaiters. The resulting injuries are starkly displayed and it would have taken just a few changes in the script to transform this from comedy to outright horror. The family engage in Satan worship and sacrifice goats as well as those new family members who choose a fatal game. Even children participate in the hunt.Samantha Weaving delivers a tour de force performance as she faces an onslaught of knives, bullets arrows and axes. .Very dark humour and horror combine to create an entertaining film. Ably directed by Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin who were also at the helm of Southbound and Devil's Due. 8/10.","

For actors, off course, for supposition to be a solid horror with some Gothic touch.And, indeed, after its end, easy to define it as ""modest"" but far to be a dessapointment.Good premises and few serious fists of naive humor.Unrealistic situations and a final reminding classic B movies.And Samara Weaving offering a role of surviver who transforms the poor Rambo in simplistic sketch. But the real star is Nicky Guadagni in a role reminding some Addams family.So, pleasant, because it is just nice to see Adam Brody as the good brother, Andie McDowel as mother between so opposite feelings, Henry Czerny as a father of family preocuped by an old ritual, a lot of blood, a burned house and bodies becoming a sort of popcorn.The real god - good- good detail- the wedding dress for who the compassion is just fair. And, sure, an eccentric entry in husband family or a pure manifesto against marriage behind a serious investigation about relatives of beloved one.","

"Ready or Not","Abdulxoxo","14 January 2021","From the trailer I thought this film looked tedious, kinda B-ish with poor acting but gladly I was wrong. Ready or Not is a decent thriller flick, and it manages to cross genres to great effect. There are action sequences, horror sequences and even some black humour. I felt tense when I was meant to. I wriggled at all the gory scenes when I meant to. Hell, I was even laughing at the dark humour, which I'm sure will not appeal to everyone. The way the screenplay sets up how and why this family is trying to kill Grace is actually really well thought out. This is a bloody, violent movie with some hilarious swearing; and I like that they didn't hold anything back.
The production design on this movie is superb. The look of the mansion and all the old weaponry work really well. The lighting is also fantastic. In addition I like the score. it has that rhythm that helps add tension to a horror movie, but in a way it also sounds sort of playful, like the children's game they are playing. In terms of the acting, everyone across the board does a great job. Samara Weaving is excellent in the lead role. Pretty much every member of the Le Domas family has a distinct personality and give a fun performance. Adam Brody's lack of interest is a constant highlight. Scrofano is there for the slapstick humour. Guadagni is just plain old scary. Her look, as well as attitude to family tradition, is just terrifying. Overall, this film is very entertaining and thrilling, and I had a good time watching it.","

I also wasnt really expecting that ending, but I loved it and thought it was so over-the-top and perfect for this story. Also, I really liked Adam Brody in this, I did feel more for his character more than the main character played by Samara Weaving (and maybe thats a slight problem) but its still an overall plus in my book. But speaking of the main character or final girl as you will, as she wasnt as badass/capable as I was hoping her to be. Its not like shes dumb necessarily, but I feel like she only survives for so long because the family has stormtrooper aim. There was a couple of moments here and there where the comedy was a bit much but overall I did really enjoy this film.","

"Ready or Not","bowmanblue","12 July 2020","Sometimes a film is generally known as one thing, but - in reality - is totally something else. It would be easy to lump 'Ready or Not' in the 'horror' category and, yes, it does have numerous elements associated with the genre. However, it's so much more. And, by 'more' I mean better... and funny (in the darkest possible way!).I remember thinking that a lot of the best films (horror or otherwise) that seemed to be made in the eighties got going very early. They didn't waste any time with redundant plot details and allowed the audience to grow with the story and characters. 'Ready or Not' does this by kicking off with everything you need to know in the first ten minutes or so. A young woman has returned to her husband-to-be's luxurious family home in order to marry him in front of his - slightly aloof - family.All goes well until after the ceremony where he informs her that it's tradition that any newcomers to the bloodline must play 'a game.' She picks out the age old classic 'Hide and Seek.' A chance choice she soon learns to regret, as this involves the family hunting her down throughout the mansion with an assortment of weapons in order to slay her.'Ready or Not' could just have been some random horror-hunt film, but the main reason to watch isn't anything to do with viewing a film that will scare you, but simply to entertain. And it does this using 'black comedy' at every turn. Yes, the family are evil murderers, but they're just so damn funny that you can't help but enjoy their performance. Plus Samara Weaving is excellent as the main character, proving that strong female leads can still exist without turning them into some sort of 'Mary Sue' trope.It's not that long in length and the runtime flies by with a mix of gore (also played for laughs in many cases!) and an awesome script which is simply there to entertain the audience. If you like your gore mixed with very dark humour you really do have to watch this one. It's a modern classic and I hope they don't make a franchise out of this because it's perfect the way it is.","

"Ready or Not","I_Ailurophile","16 September 2022","One could wax poetically for many paragraphs about the fantastic filming locations, or the production design and art direction that enrich these spaces. We could go over the excellent hair and makeup work and costume design, delightful props and weapons, and fabulous blood and gore. It's worth reflecting on the terrific music of Brian Tyler that ranges from innocent nothings, to cheeky rearrangements, to fantastic, charged themes that lend to the tension, suspense, and scenes of action. Those action scenes are executed with outstanding vibrancy, and the stunts and effects look great. Cinematography, editing, lighting, and the production values generally are very sharp, and skilled directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett capably spotlight every little detail. The cast (what a cast!) is tremendous just for the names and faces, to say nothing of the phenomenal acting they all offer up. Samara Weaving stands out most of all, naturally, as protagonist Grace, showcasing exceptional range and physicality that makes her the perfect action-horror heroine. I'm also partial to Melanie Scrofano, who made such a big impression in 'Wynonna Earp,' and her turn here as Emilie is pure comedic joy. All this is to say nothing of Henry Czerny, Nicky Guadagni, Andie MacDowell, Mark O'Brien, Elyse Levesque, and all others on hand who bring the picture to life with incredible vitality.All this is well and good and true, and it's worth discussing every last element of the movie. But most importantly - 'Ready or not' is devilishly fun!Utmost commendations to screenwriters Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy, for their screenplay is utterly stupendous. It's strongly balanced and penned with extraordinary finesse. The action is tight and invigorating, the horror is gnarly and cringe-worthy, and the comedy is as consistently funny as it is dark. Yet beyond these there are also strong themes and emotional beats that provide earnest weight to the proceedings, not least of all persistent questions about Alex's feelings, the situation that the Le Domas family is trapped in, and their perspectives on it. All this leads to a delicious variety of moods in the scene writing and dialogue as every last strain is twisted together with marvelous fluidity. Characters are written with diverse personalities, and the narrative as a whole is wonderfully compelling, and satisfying. When horror gets blended with other genres sometimes the mix doesn't always turn out quite right, but this a shining example of how, when every facet is given its time and place, keen minds can bear superb fruit.Provided one has no objections to substantial graphic violence, I can't imagine anyone I wouldn't recommend this to. Each composite aspect is realized with gratifying care and intelligence - no part is given any less treatment than another - and the result is that 'Ready or not' is is an absolute blast. If you've already watched it, it's worth watching again; if you haven't had the chance yet - well, what are you waiting for?","

"Ready or Not","ccamp89","27 August 2019","I typically enjoy schlocky horror-comedies a la Drag Me To Hell or The Cabin in the Woods, but Ready or Not just didn't quite do it for me. It has a neat premise that toys with ideas of class, privilege, and entitlement all while, of course, reveling in comic absurdity and bloodshed. It doesn't have anything particularly insightful to say but hey, I'll take a novel premise over another Annabelle copy-and-paste job any day, regardless of how shallow the subtext. My issues, then, lie more in its execution: the cartoony and somewhat irritating quality of the characters, the limpness of the humor, and the lack of memorable set pieces. I walked away from the other two aforementioned films with a head full of stand-out gags and striking images. Here, the experience largely blended together and slipped by without truly shocking, scaring, or amusing me. Perhaps that's the fault of the direction, which is so crucial in translating a good premise into a kinetic, absorbing, and visually compelling film. Still, I can see why others may enjoy this and I do appreciate the original and playfully-executed concept. Perhaps it just wasn't my cup of tea.Strong 2.5/5","

"Ready or Not","Pumpkin_Man","5 September 2019","I really had fun with this dark horror comedy. It reminds me of the story 'The Most Dangerous Game' where the hunter is hunting down real people. Some could say it's also similar to Rob Zombie's 31. It wasn't until the last act that I started smiling and laughing like a psycho and fell in love with it because of it's sheer ridiculous over the top gore, violence, and blood. Lots of blood!!Alex Le Domas comes from a mega rich family, and he's set to marry the love of his life, Grace. After the Wedding, Grace must take part in an old family tradition. She must play a game with them. Unfortunately, she has to play 'hide and seek' She has to hide while his family finds her. She has until dawn. Soon enough, she realizes that it's not just a game, they all mean to kill her!Throughout the night, Grace tries to survive by any means necessary. She even turns the tables and starts fighting back. Will this bride be able to survive her bloody Wedding night? I highly recommend READY OR NOT!!!","

"Ready or Not","justinwfirestone","13 September 2019","At a parsimonious 91 minutes, Ready or Not is about half as much of a movie as It Chapter Two, which trundles in at an unceremonious 169 minutes. If you consider the ticket was purchased with a student ID for a discount and a free 44oz. popcorn with buttery topping, it's safe to say Ready or Not is the clear winner of this summer's Battle for Your Dark Comedy Hard-earned Bucks.What if you were dirt poor and wanted to become rich through marriage to a family so wealthy they could kill some people now and then and not have any repercussions, either moral, ethical, or legal? It might involve sacrificing some of your own morality or sense of ethics, perhaps even a deal with the devil, as you learn more about what it takes to become part of an elite ruling class, with little to worry about other than what bottle of wine to quaff next.It's a slight gore-fest, but nothing nasty like a Saw flick or a Hostel pic. It might even be a more feminist statement than Mad Max: Fury Road, and for a dark comedy, it has a relatively bright ending.","

The pace is good not running out of steam. Kept me interested till the end. It's also nice not to see monsters and zombies for a change.
Samara Weaving as the new daughter in law isn't stunningly beautiful which makes her right for the role. Adam Brody is likeable. Andie Macdowell suits the role of Mother in law in a Morticia like way.

'Ready or Not' is satirical, funny, and entertaining. I especially like the fact that the female protagonist is a smart, courageous, and daring fighter, and Weaving truly delivers all the characteristics with the right amount of comics and charisma. How the directors play with the timing of events in the process is genius. Finally, a MUSIC director definitely needs praise. Solely music changes the nuance from horror to thriller to comedy: the best element of the movie.","

"Ready or Not","BJG-Reviews","5 December 2019","The stage curtains open ...Well, that was different. ""Ready Or Not"" already gets high marks for originality. It is more than just a movie about survival, love, betrayal, family, tradition, or marriage. Actually, yeah it is - all of the above. It is surprisingly deep with characterization and plot. It is a gory, good time.It is Grace's wedding day. She found a good catch with Alex, who belongs to an extremely wealthy family - a family that abounds with eccentricities. Everyone is thrilled to have her joining them and the wedding is beautiful. There is just one small detail that her new husband failed to tell her. At the stroke of midnight, on their wedding night, she needs to play a game. It is, after all, family tradition! She agrees and she draws the game of Hide & Seek. Before she knows it, she is running for her life from the very family that welcomed her in with open arms.This movie grabs you pretty much from the get-go and doesn't let go. It is paced very well, moving along at a good clip, effectively holding your attention until the explosive ending (and I use that term liberally). The acting is right on the money, the special effects and cinematography well executed, and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you wondering what in the world is going on and why.I highly recommend ""Ready Or Not"". It delivers on all counts, albeit with some over-the-top moments, but still fitting to the story. It is fun, fast and furious in it's own right with plenty of gore and blood to keep even the most picky horror fans happy. I loved this one. 9 stars out of 10.","

"Ready or Not","gwnightscream","29 November 2019","This 2019 comedy-thriller stars Samara Weaving, Mark O'Brien and Adam Brody. Weaving (The babysitter) plays young woman, Grace who marries wealthy guy, Alex (O'Brien). After the wedding, Grace is invited to participate in a traditional yet lethal game for those who come into the family. She finds herself in a nightmare and discovers that her in-laws are unhinged.
Brody plays Alex's brother, Daniel and Andie MacDowell (Groundhog Day) and Henry Czerny (Mission: Impossible) are also featured. This is a pretty good flick that sort of resembles ""Clue"" with suspense, gore and humor. The beautiful, Weaving is not only good in here, but also reminds me a little of Margot Robbie.

"Ready or Not","CANpatbuck3664","7 October 2019","I didn't know what to expect from Ready or Not but while I ended up being very impressed by the end, I wasn't on board at the start. The movie has a serious open with another new addition to the family ""playing the game"" and while the movie gets a little lighter when they shift to present day, it still lacked fun elements. They don't establish as many rules or alternatives for the premise as they should (probably my biggest gripe) and the idea of the hunt for Grace seems half-baked. But with an unexpected death, the movie makes a decision and goes a different route. This was what pulled me back in, the shift to make it a comedy was the correct one. There are very dark moments in this movie (I liked how they set up the mythology of the Le Domas family) but you are never far away from something that will make you laugh. If you aren't easily shocked or you love horror movies, there's some really funny stuff in here and it's the reason to go see this movie.Samara Weaving is on the rise, she was the only good aspect of The Babysitter (which was an attempt at a horror/comedy that missed the mark completely) and she had a brief appearance in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. She's a great heroine here, she can elicit sympathy in the dramatic moments but she was also really funny in those darkly comedic bits. She's a great asset to this movie and she shines. I think this will be a stepping stone to bigger things for her and with how excellent she was in this movie, if they decide to shoot a sequel, they should definitely bring her back.With Samara Weaving giving such a strong performance as the lead, the supporting cast is left to fill in the blanks. The family makes for a decent group of antagonists, the biggest name in the supporting cast is either Adam Brody or Andie McDowell. Brody is a better actor than he's given credit for, his character is complicated and I think Brody does a solid job of selling that. Andie is fine, she's a little wooden but she does a better job than I expected her to. My favourite was Melanie Scrofano (who I know as Bonnie McMurray in the hilarious show Letterkenny) as family screwup Emilie, she's over-the-top but she got some good laughs from me. Ditto for Kristian Braun for play Fitch. Mark O'Brien, Elyse Levesque and Henry Czerny round out the rest of the main players and they all do a solid job.Ready or Not goes through plenty of twists and turns to get to the end, some work better than others but I didn't have any problem going along with it. The ending pulls a nice bait and switch and then the creative team pushes all of their chips into pot. The final 5 minutes features some big finishes that aren't revolutionary but they had me giggling with what they chose to do. It was an interesting call but minus it taking the edge off the previous couple of scenes, it largely works.Ready or Not represented a different type of experience for me. When I go see a movie, I usually have watched the trailer, read or listened to a couple of reviews and investigated what I'm committing a couple of hours to (give or take a couple of minutes). I had heard the basic premise (which I didn't think was spectacular) but when I went to see this with a friend, we went in cold. I had seen it was well reviewed but having that fresh perspective really helped me enjoy it. Ready or Not was such a pleasant surprise and if your sense of humour skews towards a darker sensibility, I think it will be your cup of tea too. Its really funny, Samara Weaving is a great heroine, she's funny yet I was invested in her making it to the end. The supporting cast hits the right notes in helping the movie remain entertaining and I liked that they went all out with the ending. They don't pull punches and while it was surprisingly wacky, I liked the direction they went. Ready or Not doesn't hit the high that comparable horror/comedy Happy Death Day but this is a good alternative that is worth a watch. If I wasn't so late getting the review up, I'd definitely recommend seeing it in theatres but considering the time that lapsed, check this out on your preferred streaming service when it becomes available.","

"Ready or Not","dfranzen70","5 December 2019","I realize that a lot of people have seen the more-recent Knives Out, which has a similar plot (rich people, big mansion, murder), but those similarities are superficial. Ready or Not is much more in the vein of You're Next, a family gathering gone awry, a horror movie with spots of comedic activity, and just as bloody. Here, Grace (Samara Weaving), having just married Alex (Mark O'Brien) at his super-rich family's super-big house, learns on her wedding night that she must play a game in order to be accepted into the family. The game is chosen through mystic randomness, and previous players have selected games like chess and Old Maid. Grace, though, gets Hide and Seek. Sounds like a fun game to play, especially in such a large building that's filled with tons of nooks, crannies, dumbwaiters, smart waiters, you name it. But it's not meant to be fun, as we soon find out - the family members, while Grace innocently hides, arm themselves with rifles, handguns, knives, and even a crossbow. How can she win? Grace wonders. Last until daylight, she's told. Good luck with that! The upsides of this movie far outweigh its main problem, that there's a real lack of chemistry between Weaving and O'Brien. The supporting cast is fine, but Andie McDowell, playing Alex's mother, is a real standout; it's a lot of fun to see the star of Groundhog Day and sex, lies, and videotape in a real horror movie, and she steals every scene with a commanding performance. And there's just enough humor to counteract some of the darker themes and scenes, particularly in the final act.","

"Ready or Not","kannibalcorpsegrinder","29 December 2019","Preparing to marry into a wealthy family, a bride learns of a tradition on the wedding night where they're going to play a game with the family, and upon learning they're to play hide-and-seek realizes there's a far deadlier secret motivation for the choice of games and tries to survive the family night.For the most part, this one was an absolute blast. Among the many positives here is the buy-in of such a ludicrous premise into being a believable part of the family's history. That the film is concerned early on with the secretive nature of the family tradition that they have to play in order to be accepted gives the film a deep backstory. The history lesson that tells of the history that explains how it all started as well as the continuous notions to stay on tradition hunting everyone with classic weapons and techniques speaks to the family's status and secret nature rather well. That leads into the titular game itself, which is an absolute high-energy blast that mixes together the ludicrous premise with fun action. That they're chasing her around the house as she's unaware of the true nature of what they're hunting her for gives the first few scenes a sense of crazy over-the-top work where they go around shooting at each other, wielding crossbows and trying to chop her to pieces provides some crazy visuals. The confrontations become quite fun as there are encounters in the secret catacombs of the house, in various game rooms and meeting parlors or outside on the estate grounds that showcase not only luck on her part to survive but also plenty of drive and determination to do so. In addition, there's a wicked sense of humor to come from these encounters and situations that gives the film a sense of fun. The general premise of hunting an oblivious woman in order to prepare her for a Satanic sacrifice allows this one to offer up some fun where they mistake each other for the target and get killed accidentally to where the reactions after-the-fact generate some funny moments. There are also the hysterical smart-aleck comebacks and quips that are featured here which provide this one with several fine chuckles as well, leaving this one to have enough to like here with the mixture of goofy comedy to alleviate the serious nature of the hunting. That leaves the finale as the main troublesome spot of the film which seems to be simply an individual basis. Due to the family's desire to capture her alive rather than outright killer her, the finale devolves into a series of scenes knocking her out only to drag her into the altar room for the ritual where she escapes and forcing the chase again. It feels repetitive and completely highlights the ending resolution which is a massive cheat and utter letdown. Taking a realistic but unsatisfactory course of action where she's completely passive and not responsible is a cop-out of the highest order, despite the wild action featured which might make some forgive this one. However, it's really the only area where this one approaches a flaw.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.","

"Ready or Not","Cinema-reviewer321","22 June 2023","I did not know what I was going to expect from a movie that is like a more deadly game of hide and seek that starred Samara Weaving, but since I like Samara Weaving, I wanted to check it out. I had a fun time Ready or Not (2019), and thought it was a good horror comedy, even though it had some small issues.I will start by saying that Samara Weaving was incredibly good in the movie. She starts out being scared once she finds out what is going on, but soon gets the upper hand against the family which was what I wanted to see happen because I wanted her to survive the game. She does this all while wearing a wedding dress that gets ripped, dirty, and bloody throughout the movie as she hides or fights back.The family who are forced to play this game and hunt for Grace do an excellent job in the movie; they seem nice but eventually become insane and psychotic. They will seem too over the top with some performances, but they are funny mostly because of the dark and violent humor that is in this movie that can be shocking at times. Each character is weird in their own way in this movie.The look of the big house or mansion the family has does look cool, and big when the game begins with a lot of rooms, secret compartments, and dumbwaiters for hiding places. The cinematography is nice, and the look and feel of the place is eerie, especially because of the past of this house and family. The chase scenes or any action scene between the characters.There are some scenes that can be slow or not needed, but the movie is a fun horror comedy for most of the movie that has dark humor that works well with the horror scenarios. Ready or Not (2019) was a fun horror comedy that had effective scares and funny comedy, but surprising moments that I did not expect especially in the third act climax along with the movie being investing to watch wanting the main character to survive the game. If you like horror comedies or interesting premises like this, then you will like this movie.","

"Ready or Not","gustheaffen","25 August 2019","People that say this is the worst horror movie ever clearly have not seen many horror movies. Well done, well cast and entertaining story even if some of it was somewhat predictable. Instead of just having the typical bash the rich they spun that to bash the rich but also all the greedy spouses that married into the family were forced to fight for their lives too. Just because they didn't get Hide & Seek when they had to play on their marriage night they were forced to play with the same consequence which was pretty ingenious and I thought the end was great. There were a lot of comical parts to the movie, many of the deaths were funny as was the YouTube video on how to us a weapon and it was also quite gory in parts. Overall I found it an entertaining 90 minutes and one of the better movies of this genre I've seen in years. I enjoyed it much more than Get Out and Halloween last year.
There could also probably be a sequel now that she is the survivor of the game.","

"Ready or Not","Stovepipe99","21 August 2019","Is an 8/10 a little generous?Maybe.But I just got back from seeing this one in the theater and it was the perfect summer horror film: bloody and funny and just plain FUN.I really have very few criticisms about this film. Was it maybe a little predictable? I guess. But knowing where the story was going didn't stop me from enjoying the ride.Samara Weaving did a great job in the title role. Unlike a lot of films of this type, she doesn't just go from wilting violet to gun-toting war machine in the blink of an eye. Her character really goes through a complicated series of emotions and encounters, and the film wisely gives her strong scenes with the characters of her husband, her brother-in-law, and her mother-in-law. Even the more secondary characters are given distinct personalities and motivations, and so despite the sprawling cast I knew exactly who each character was and it added some impact to the violent scenes when they arrived.Adam Brody is really good as Daniel, the brother who reluctantly participates in his family's cruel traditions. I didn't even recognize Melanie Scrofano (I know her from Wynonna Earp) as the coked up sister-in-law, but she was hilarious.Without venturing into spoiler territory, I found the film to be violent and bloody, but not cruel or depressing. A lot of the violence was darkly funny, and the actors are generously doused with blood and gore. It has some broad themes about what people will do to become rich or to stay rich--a criticism of both rich people and the non-rich people who are willing to do horrible things to climb the ladder. But the film isn't overly concerned with delivering a message, so the broadness of its themes didn't bug me.Movies are always better on the big screen, but I would highly recommend this film as a rental--especially for a movie night with a group of friends.","

"Ready or Not","robertemerald","20 October 2020","Ready or Not is thoroughly entertaining, with many, many shock deaths, all gory, a wicked script and wizard performances, particularly the dazzling lead. There's good colour and direction, some supremely dastardly characters, and a pretty big cast. I wouldn't say it's the most original horror I've ever seen, but there are some real touches of originality, particularly with the survival/fight sequences. Truly it gets a 10 though for the performance, character and casting of the lead.","

"Ready or Not","bhernandez2216","29 August 2019","""Ready or Not"" is a pretty good comedy/horror film, the movie is about a bride, who choses the wrong card game called 'Hide and Seek', and Hide and Seek is one the best game that all children should enjoy, but this is not one of the best Hide and Seek you've expected. The film reminded me of Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"", because this film added psycho family, just like this one, and Ready or Not, is one of the worst deadliest game of Hide and Seek, that you never even heard, seen, or played before. ""Ready or Not"" is now in Theaters. One of the best funny horror comedy of the summer. Get ready to play Hide and Seek, because Ready or Not... you'll never guess what's gonna happen, if they find you. Ready or Not! Here... They... Come!","

Horror? Suspenseful? Slasher? Black Comedy? If it is any of them then it fails miserably.The movie was like fat guy stripping down naked and flashing his bum and waving his belly and expecting you not just to laugh but also like him but it just back fires.I've seen over 20 films in the IMDB bottom 100 and Ready or Not makes them look like masterpieces.Pure garbage which is why I walked out of the cinema after 20 minutes of torture.It's a really sad world we live in where a lot of really good scripts don't get made into movies and other projects get cancelled or gets into development hell but trash like these get made.","

"Ready or Not","lluewhyn","13 September 2019","While the concept of The Most Dangerous Game involving a woman against her in-laws is somewhat original, the execution of this film is bad.Problems:
1. This is probably the most undeveloped main character I have ever seen. You learn almost nothing about her history or desires, which makes it really hard to care about her more than the fact she's being chased by murderers. Most of the characterization and time is spent with the family members, who are the villains, and almost all of them are pathetic.2. The profanity in this film is over the top. The characters probably swear twice as much as a Tarantino film, and with a lot less creativity or impact. It would be funnier to hear the ""blue-blood"" family start swearing once things start getting so bad for them, but all of them are swearing left and right from the beginning of the film so there's no escalation that makes the profanity interesting.3. The film teases out a class struggle at the very beginning, with the protagonist concerned about marrying into this upper crust family, but along with the swearing from #2 these family members really don't act very high class at all, the main character Grace has a posh accent that doesn't make her come off as lower class, so this plot/theme goes nowhere at all.4. It looks like the filmmakers were trying to make this more realistic at times (but not consistently so), so the main protagonist has no special combat skills, ingenuity, or athletic ability. As a result, too many of her ""successes"" are pure luck or someone doing something stupid. As a result, this film pits the Unremarkable vs. the Unintelligent. This isn't that exciting.5. There are really very few interesting set pieces, probably due to lack of imagination or funds. The action appears in short, boring bursts, and there's no visual wow factor. You get the feeling they didn't have much in the way of stunt coordinators.6. A related problem is that you never get a good perspective of the mansion or grounds, and with characters wandering in and out of the plot at random, you never get a really good perspective of how difficult it would be to ""seek"" Grace. The film just meanders from room to room, and the tension of the hunt just dissipates as a result. I'm guessing they just didn't have the funds to acquire a good interior location for the set.","

"Ready or Not","thekarmicnomad","20 December 2019","A woman who has just married into a rich, eccentric family discovers she has to play a game with the family on her wedding night.
No biggie.
Except as you have probably surmised from the movie poster it is not going to be a fun game.This has a lot of what you would expect: running around lofty corridors, sneaking through the spaces in the walls, hiding in kitchen cupboards and some gore that will make you wince.The film has a very witty dark humour running through it.
Inappropriate quips are made as the family members and servants are reduced to bloody pulp.What really makes this film is the lead character.
A very fine balance is maintained between her being a determined protagonist and a human being.
It is nice to see a lead character actually show a modicum of fear and distress when someone runs at them with an axe.
Samara Weaving has an awful lot piled on her shoulders and she carries it very well.
The rest of the family are also excellent and add comic relief and drama.Production and camera work is all top notch without being too extravagant.
This is not particularly scary but is quite a violent film in a slapstick kind of way.Great fun - don't take it too serious and you will have a ball.","

Comedies like this can too often land well wide of the mark and it's refreshing to see one that delivers.It isn't just a comedy though. There's a solid story and no shortage of bloody violence and gore too. Without being too deep or complex, it still steered away from the obvious outcomes in most of the scenes, which kept me guessing where exactly it would end up.Samara Weaving is great in the lead role and is supported excellently by the rest of the cast (some for longer than others).Stylish, fun and fast-paced. 8/10Also watch the Babysitter with Samara Weaving too.

"Ready or Not","RahulM007","16 November 2019","""Ready or Not"" is one of the best horror movies of 2019. It focuses on a bride whose welcomed in her husband's eccentric family. The movie is nor traditional or predictable. The twists and turns throughout the movie are all unexpected and shocking.The lead actress Samara Weaving who portrays Grace reminds me so much of Margot Robbie. The resemblance she has with her is uncanny. Grace had a quite open attitude to the family game/ritual, but that changed when she found out the true nature of it all.The levity in this movie was perfect and was not forced at all. It made some scenes more bearable to watch. I was at the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie and was not extremely fond of the gore and bloodiness depicted frequently in scenes. In hindsight, this movie is a horror movie and should feature these scenes.The twist at the end where Alex has a complete change in character and is on board with the whole family ritual was unexpected. I thought that Alex and Grace would escape together and never see the family again. In reality, Grace murdered Alex's mother and that drove Alex on a dark path and trying to fulfill the family ritual.The family failed to kill Grace by dawn, so they exploded. The house was haunted by the ghost of their grandfather. I thought that the family made all of this up. It was an interesting turn of events. It would have been quite anticlimactic if the whole family did not die.To conclude, ""Ready or Not"" is my favorite horror movie of 2019. It was a blast to watch this movie in the cinema. Strangely enough, the audience was not laughing at the scenes I found particularly funny. But everyone has different tastes.","

"Ready or Not","DarkVulcan29","22 August 2019","Think of a board game you get real into it, that is what Ready or Not kind of feels like. New Bride to be(Samara Weaving) feels like she does not fit in with the grooms rich family, on her wedding night is asked to play a game of hide and seek, what she believes is fun, turns into a night of getting out alive, when she realizes that the grooms family intends on hunting her down.This is not just a horror film, but very darkly humorous also. Samara Weaving(who is the niece of actor Hugo Weaving) really plays her part very well, you root for her all the way. All the characters are pretty good, you can see the actors all are having fun making this. But the other main stand out is Adam Brody, who plays the grooms brother, he plays his part with such conflict very well, you just really see it in his character. It feels like interesting story telling by Quentin Tarantino and M. Night Shyamalan, and an ending you'll talk about for a while.","

"Ready or Not","JohnRayPeterson","8 December 2019","I'm not usually interested in the comedy horror thriller, but when I caught the ratings on another site and read some of the reviews here, I decided to give it a go. I was absolutely delighted. Best if I control myself and spare you any sort of spoiler; also best if you avoid them too, as your viewing experience will be that more rewarding.The concept was original and every element worked well, from a cast of characters who all have an important part to play to how well they played their part. The script I would tend to believe was an easy sell to the producers. Samara Weaving who plays the main character, Grace, doesn't steal the show, she is the show. You will have your pick of delicious characters to root for, oh yes you will; and by 'root for' I mean wish you could beat the living daylight out of, but always in a fun way.The production and direction appear not to have missed any detail, important or small, which is why the story flows well. As for the visual, again, very pleasant and most importantly, effective. Lastly but not to be denied, the soundtrack and tune selection was right on the money; it enhanced it all superbly. If you understand what contrast in art, all forms of it, is about and how it works, then you'll get that the contrast the soundtrack delivered is what brings you to smile all along and without missing a beat to the very end.If this review didn't provide any clue of what the movie is about, except for the genre, but left you with a feeling that it is one you would want to see, then you can thank me later, after you've watched it.","

"Ready or Not","matthewssilverhammer","30 August 2019","Not since 2011's Cabin in the Woods has a horror comedy been this uniquely fun, cleverly written, and perfectly demented. And like Cabin..., it's not flawless; the direction certainly could use a defter touch, especially in the cinematography and scare controls (oddly, Wes Anderson came to mind as an interesting replacement). However, if the flaws are part of the package, a package that includes a wonderfully original script and pitch perfect performances, then like a good marriage, I'll take the better and the worse.
Like Get Out, it's a horror satire that presents one of our biggest fears: a worst-case-scenario for meeting the in-laws. On her wedding night, Grace (Weaving) is forced into a deadly game of hide-and-seek with her husband's family. The balance of tones and genres here is vital and difficult, but they hit the target at each turn, giving us a wonderfully absurd 70's grindhouse / Roger Corman picture for the modern day. Weaving is sensational and hilarious as the baddest bride since Uma Thurman hunted down Bill, and the cast of characters hunting her down are varied and often side-splittingly funny.
Underneath the entertainment heights, there is plenty of sharp satire bubbling up. The rich preying on the poor. Selling our souls for the almighty dollar. The trappings of our upbringing. The motivating power of all kinds of fear. The absurdity of religious certainty. Each of these elements packs a punch, but none of it would hit as hard if the movie weren't also an absolute blast. Ready or Not is easily one of my favorite films of the year, and I can't wait to watch it again and again.","

The game however hide and seek and when they find her she'll be sacrificed. This movie takes the cat and mouse aspect of your next and mixes it with the comedic charm of knives out. It's a fun over the top film. You can tell all these actors are having a good time and enjoying themselves, while giving memorable performances. The settings are very well this whole manor is just right for various situations that happen. It doesn't really beat around the bush the opening it gets to the game rather quick. The costume designs are nice. Grace is awesome she's very believable she doesn't come off as Op, which where she's just one shot it everyone and giving them the roundabout. She does get injured and she does good get bloodied and bruised ,but you really don't know anything about her the focus is primarily kept on the family. The duality between the two brothers Alex and Daniel you really get a general feel that Alex really does care for Grace and wants to see you're safe , where's Daniel you don't really know what to make of him he's more neutral and he honestly does not even care about this whole ordeal. You're left wondering what the outcome out it's going to be, this whole event that may happen with the whole family will die if Grace doesn't die before dawn. The thing is the family doesn't actually know what will happen so it does make you wonder is there actually something going on here are they just a bunch of psychotic rich people?","

"Ready or Not","Benslie","23 August 2019","First of all, I wish this film was a bit longer. The film is one hour and thirty-five minutes, with credits, and I feel like if it was longer it would have helped it out a bit more. This is a slight spoiler but it's the opening scene so either skip over this or read it but the film just jumps straight into the film. There is no lead up into it, it just jumps right in so not till later in the film do we learn why they are doing this. So, I feel like a couple of extra minutes in this film could have helped it out. The acting starts out cheesy and kind of annoying but as the film goes on and the stakes get higher it takes a sharp turn and becomes pretty good. As the movie progresses you get to see which family members are fully invested into this and which ones would rather not do it. I will say that Grace is one of the most badass characters in horror and I was always cheering her on. I will say the editing in the film is kind of award at times and makes no sense. I say sometimes because most of the time it's edited just fine but in a couple of scenes it just jumps to a scene that isn't connected and almost feels like the directors were like, ""Shoot we forgot that one scene well let's just throw it in between these two scenes even though it doesn't make any sense to."" This film is a horror-comedy and I will say they balance the two well and a couple of scenes had me chuckling. The last thing I want to mention is the score by Brian Tyler is great. In the end, I highly recommend checking out this film at least once because it's a unique and original story and we don't have a lot of that now a day.","

Fully delivered, and was clever, fun, and as stylish as trailer promised. Had a plot, an actual story, which is rare for a horror film, and good writing, acting, production value. I was into it from beginning to end. Kept good pacing, was not too long or too short, and everything was clear and well explained without overdoing it and feeding everything to the audience.Best horror film since Cabin in the Woods. Happy Death Day had a similar fun, but a bit more b-movie than this. A warm welcome since most horror films over the past 20 years have really sucked. They've been either the gore porn garbage of the 2000s, or found-footage with terrible quality and zero story, or shock-value indie directors with lack of actual substance, so, this was refreshing.It's made much more than it's budget, but I'm guessing it hasn't done better because there wasn't that much advertising for it, and given the news today, people are a bit turned off by the subject matter. It wasn't gratuitous, and relied much more on the story, which had a point and was not just random violence.Well worth it to see in the theatre, but renting it at home will probably be nearly as enjoyable.","

The rest of the family is convinced if they do not follow the game's rules they will end up with an unfavorable fate. Now this whole allegory wraps up nicely in the end. At first I didn't like the ending but now I see why it was that way. Don't take it too seriously, you'll laugh and have some thrills, give it a go!","

"Ready or Not","sini-200","9 July 2020","Literally. I watched this movie with not much of knowing it and i'd say that's the best. It did fall couple of usual horror cliches but the dark humour in this movie is great. Acting was on point too, especially Grace. It's not really scary movie but keeps you at the edge of your seat waiting for the end. The twists of the characters were nice and the ending was something I didn't see coming, I'm still kinda blown away (pun intended). Also don't watch if you have a weak stomach.","

The film rattles along at a great pace and you really never know what's coming next, right to the very end. The effects are great and characters are excellent.But it's the comedy element that makes this film so good, there are real laugh out loud moments which just keep popping up out of nowhere amid the scary elements.My horror film of the year so far.","

No back story, just out of the blue they have to kill a stranger. Pretty dumb premise and found myself not caring about any of them.
So tired of Hollywood having ideas that could have been good but through dumbing them down, or sexing them up, the idea is lost and they produce another piece of crap.

I, on the other hand, have yet to see a Saw (sorry about that, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or indeed anything remorely resembling 'horror' so I was happy to go along with this black comedy and bask in the laugh out loud moments that punctuated it. I doubt if it would claim to be another Some Like It Hot, or even Young Frankenstein but it's harmless and reasonably entertaining.","

"Ready or Not","joseph-brak","9 October 2020","Ready or Not pits a newly wed bride against the wealthy - and homicidal - in-laws on her wedding night. Samara Weaving does a great job at playing the victim while also remaining resilient, and brings a sense of sassy style to the character, aided by her cool and clever costume design (great cosplay potential!). The setting of an extravagant and slightly ominous mansion really adds to the flavour of the film as well. The subtle mystery element to the plot is also concluded with a near perfect ending, which matches the slightly bizarre nature of the film and leaves the film finishing on a high note.","

"Ready or Not","joshbarton15","29 September 2019","Marital bliss, achieved through the matrimony of two people very much in love and willing to spend the rest of their lives together in sickness and in health, until ""death do us part"". In the hands of Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, that death may come sooner than you'd expect into the marriage with Ready or Not, a thunderously entertaining black comedy horror.When Grace (Samara Weaving) and Alex (Mark O'Brien) become newlyweds, Grace doesn't get the wedding night she'd expect when Alex's family force her to take part in a murderous game of hide and seek in which she must survive the night to be officially welcomed to the family.If done right, films like Ready or Not can be absolute crowd-pleasers, as long as you go along with the lunacy served up by the filmmakers. Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy have conjured up a devilishly funny screenplay, full of put-downs as sharp as knives and plenty of gleeful violence. It's a film that wears its 18 certificate like a badge of honour, decorating the hallways with blood as the game of hide and seek ramps up in intensity, and it's really great to see a film not hold back in this sense.Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett do a slick job of directing the chaos, Brett Jutkiewicz's cinematography opening up hiding spaces amidst the glorious country house setting for the film while Brian Tyler's score possesses an energy that accompanies Grace's fight for survival so fittingly.Samara Weaving may well look like Margot Robbie however, she's well on her way to attaining star status on her own merits thanks to a fantastic lead performance in Ready or Not, the combination of sheer terror and comedy she brings to the film no doubt making her a future icon of the genre. The supporting cast really do make this such a treat as well, Henry Czerny and Nicky Guadagni in particular going all out in the insanity department for our entertainment.I had an absolute blast watching Ready or Not, a film that will most likely be experienced best with the biggest audience possible. Both my future wife and I came out thoroughly entertained however, if any of her family suggest playing hide and seek on our wedding day, I'm running for the hills.","

"Ready or Not","Pjtaylor-96-138044","29 September 2019","For me, the comedy in 'Ready Or Not (2019)' isn't all that successful. It's never particularly funny and its attempts at humour sometimes, but only sometimes, reduce immersion. Usually, however, this isn't an issue. The tone is pretty much spot-on for the knowingly absurd narrative, turning what could've been a self-serious and, therefore, seriously silly affair into a near inside joke with its tongue planted firmly in its cheek. The beauty of it all is that there's never an attempt to undercut the weight of the situation. It's a fight for survival, on both sides, and it's as messy as you'd expect. In fact, the comedic beats often serve more as character insights than anything else, allowing the piece to build an interesting and relatively realistic set of core players. Most characters react as you'd expect them to, which is rarer than you'd think. Also, the villainous family are given much more time and nuance than the trailers seemed to indicate. Everyone has an understandable mindset, even if it's violent and deranged, and a few key folk undergo some serious character arcs that are expertly established and surprisingly executed. Generally, the flick follows a predictable formula but it has more than enough charm to account for this. It becomes somewhat repetitive as it goes on but it's always compelling and its finale is subversively satisfying. There's not as much focus on 'fight-back revenge' as I anticipated, which actually makes for a more intriguing time. Where everything ends up is a shock, but it's built to so naturally that it feels inevitable. The whole thing is just so grounded, probably the most relatable version possible. It's entertaining throughout and it's always smiling alongside you. That doesn't mean that it misses out on the pain such a piece requires. There are several moments that should make you wince and the protagonist is certainly put through the wringer, both inside and out. The overall message is slightly muddled - though, to say why would be a spoiler - and the ending may just have been better if it went in another, hinted-at direction (mainly when it comes to clarifying what seems to be the movie's initial intent). Still, there are underlying themes which are interesting to explore retrospectively and the consistent focus on character is commendable. The experience, as it is, is both enjoyable and believable. Its story is purposefully silly, wonderfully so, and it's handled with a fantastic balance of humour and gravitas. I actually buy everything the affair is selling. I think I like it more now than I did just after the credits had rolled. There's never a dull moment, really. It's remarkably consistent entertainment. 7/10","

"Ready or Not","cherold","12 January 2020","After watching the first tedious half hour of Ready or Not I began to wonder if it was really the kick-ass comedy-horror movie of the trailer, so I took a look at the IMDB reviews. And I discovered, much to my confusion, that no one seemed to agree on whether the movie was a comedy or a horror movie. Some felt it was comedy-horror, but others felt it was a horror movie with a few comedy bits (that some liked and some didn't).Having watched the movie I now understand. The movie has scenes that are definitely comedic involving the ridiculous characters and some startling moments of comedic violence. And the movie has scenes of grim struggle and peril. But these scenes don't particularly feel like they're part of the same movie, and there's no integration of the two elements; no moments that are scary but funny or funny but scary.For me, the funny parts are quite good. But I found the horror elements intrusive in the way some reviewers here found the comedy elements intrusive. Which parts you find bothersome will be a matter, perhaps, or your expectations.By the halfway point I started fast forwarding through the horror bits just to see how it all turned out.There is a good comedy-horror movie trapped inside Ready or Not. There's also a decent B horror movie trapped in there. The two movies don't get along.The cast is quite good, particularly protagonist Samara Weaving, who has an intensity that makes her interesting even before things get crazy.To summarize: Boring first half hour, some really good comedy horror, some non-comedy horror that I guess is okay for that sort of thing, pretty good ending.Not recommended.","

"Ready or Not","CinemaClown","20 September 2019","Refreshingly original, riotously fun & ridiculously entertaining, Ready or Not is a slick, sly & subversive delight that packs a ridiculous premise yet implements it with such flair & finesse that it is one of the best surprises to surface in cinemas this year. Wild & wicked from start to finish, it is all the more bolstered by a star-making turn from Samara Weaving.Directed by a collective trio of filmmakers known as Radio Silence, the set-up is quick, the fundamentals are illustrated with clarity, and once the main plot kicks in, the directors steadily up the ante and cleverly balance the extreme with the grounded to make sure that the cinematic ride isn't just tense & thrilling but also fun & amusing throughout its runtime.Apart from the intelligently written script, this gnarly survival horror also benefits from its aptly processed colour grading, dark & delirious ambience, sumptuous set pieces, sharp editing, brisk pace, pulsating score, costume design and clever mix of dark humour & thrills. Coming to performances, Samara Weaving is a revelation in her role, and renders her character's overwhelming feelings with both authenticity & precision.On an overall scale, Ready or Not deftly merges horror, humour & cultural critique into one sharp, stylish & scintillating horror-comedy that scores high on all fronts. A vicious, vivid & vigorous blend of You're Next & Get Out that makes the most of available resources to deliver a cinematic experience that's an absolute blast from the first frame to the last, this indie horror-comedy is one of the most enjoyable & entertaining examples of its genre(s).","

"Ready or Not","quaseprovisorio","1 April 2020","This movie is not very different from some leisure activities of french or the portuguese royalty. They would release a pig in the woods, or another animal to eat and the first person getting it or killing it would be the winner. With another context this isn't very different: a bunch of powerful peope against someone from a foster family. The Man vs you.It is put in a very simple way yes - but the truth is: if this wasn't the main theme of the film, the killing order would be very different. Notice how the first ones to die are the maids and the driver? They are the weaker ones. The powerful die at the end. I would love to see the theme getting more developed, because it would be funnier to see the bride killing them, but they are humans too and the movie expresses that well.Besides that, the film has funny moments and some gory moments too, that are an appeal to the audience. But what makes this movie having dark humor is how unworried about the life of the ""peasants"" the rich family is. It's their indifference that makes the funny part of this movie, how normal they treat their employees getting killed. It's like they don't even realize they are human beings like them. Maybe they don't give them the same value they attribute to themselves.That's why this movie is a seven for me and not a six or even a five. Without the social commentary is not as good as other scary movies. But because that layer is important here, i think it elevates to most of scary movies out there.","

Ready or Not succeeds quite well tho, I was entertained. It's not that much of a horror, as it's not really scary, but rather depends on the gore. I bet real gore hounds would've liked even more, but a few scenes were a bit too much for me, not a huge gore fan here.My kind of ""horror"" comedy is the lighter kind, Joe Dante etc, not necessarily the Evil Dead etc kind that are more hard core.What I liked was the somewhat cliched crazy family mansion, candles, thunder, secret passages kind of old school ""gothic"" atmosphere, it made a lot for me.

"Ready or Not","Jackblyth8","27 December 2021","A film of extreme consequence, with a thrilling, fast pace allowing the vehicle that is a seemingly innocent game turn into a breathless horror of fatality.After the wedding ceremony of a young woman, her new in-laws force her to participate in a seemingly innocent game. Things soon turn bloody and sinister, revealing the sick rituals of the family.Star of Sex, Lies and Videotapes Andie MacDowell is the single 'big' name of the production, which is naturally an off-putting feature when deciding what to watch. Ready or Not is a title of ambiguity for the film presented, rather than the game, this idea of hiding in an attempt to not be found, or running away from the past, or maybe questioning the bride's ability to meet the standards of the family she is marrying into - Tyler Gillet and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin are the architects behind the horror which sets heads spinning from its violent uses of brutality, one could argue one too many shots fired and knives stabbing.The setting takes place in the radius of a gated area (albeit large), the historical mansion proving token to the film's background as well as the vast garden adding irony to the picture's core, despite playing Hide and Seek there is but limited room to hide and in-turn limited room to seek. Claustrophobia is a theme which drives the motives of the 95 minute watch, an elaborate, primitive concept well concealed in a sublimely finished script.Gaining a respectable 6.9/10 on IMDB along with an impressive 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, the film that amassed over $57 million in its Box Office proved a dark horse in the film game, and rightly so, with a narrow budget of $6 million, Ready or Not is a different kind of mystical, and most certainly worth a watch.","

"Ready or Not","mixymaxy","17 December 2020","I'm a big horror fan and my preferences are a little different from others. I like movies with sick and sinister games, movies with a variety of characters to choose from, movies that dont lose 'horror' while adding 'comedy', movies with a cheerworthy protagonist, or movies that are good till the end. Any of these traits make me like a movie. Thats the reason I hate movies like Hereditary.
Ready or Not, however, was an unexpected bomblast. At the time of its release, I felt like its a boring old fashioned horror (I'm a modern horror fan), so I didn't even research about it. An year later, when I was in quarantine, I found Ready or Not's sypnosis quite attracting. Finally, I decided to watch it and it is my favourite movie now. I would give it infinity stars if possible.
Ready or Not offers a range of characters from the funny, dumb Emilie to the Caring yet deadly Becky. Needless to say, Samara Weaving stole the show by a far margin. Her performance was uncomparable. Probably one of the best movie performances ever. After that, the rest of the crew was no less either. The problem I get with most movies that offer a varying personalities is that as characters die, the movie gets boring. But Ready or Not gives us a roller coaster ride with a satisfying ending, which makes me smile everytime I watch it.
The Hide and Seek Song is a very effective song as well.
Moreover, Ready or Not has a perfect dose of comedy and its protagonist is not stupid. Samara Weaving has always killed the roles she played no matter if it was The Babysitter's Bee or Bill or Ted Face the Music's Theodora.
The movie is worthy of a watch.
I recommend it 100%. I hope we get a sequel.","

The problem is that even with a very nice cast the movie jerks between the two themes never really transitioning smoothly. At times it feels like the direction was ""okay this time we are going to kill someone for laughs"" or ""in this one the murder is serious"". It's one of those movies that you find that you never heard of and after watching it you understand why. Not the worst thing available but in six months I doubt I remember anything about it other than Samara Weaving was in it. Knives Out works much better if you want to watch a messed up rich family murder movie, though not nearly as bloody.","

Well, it really was quite an enjoyable romp, but I beg to differ and oppose to those who praise ""Ready or Not"" for originality and are calling it refreshing or unique.""Ready or Not"" is without a doubt a solid one to add to the not-so-many great horror comedies of this century, but it's also far from flawless. An unsuspecting woman is getting married at her new husbands massively rich familys house, a bunch of dysfunctional and secretive family members get introduced, a silly and mysterious tradition turns into a violent, devious and satanic rollercoaster. The pacing's even, we get carried on smoothly by solid acting, quality cinematography, gruesome kills, dry humour and somewhat familiar characters. Personally, it was the violence, action, the overall aesthetic and some of the performances that did it for me. I laughed maybe once, the jokes are pretty dry and mostly far from original, but I do not think of it as much of a fault here. The twist/s (if you can call them that) are predictable, in fact, the whole movie is quite easy to predict. Most of the themes presented have been seen before, recent indies like ""Satanic Panic"" and ""Monster Party"" come to mind, of course, these specific ones are a lot cheaper and also worse examples of the same themes. The dysfunctional family farce and all the shticks that come with it have been enjoyed tens of times before, sadly, ""Ready or Not"" doesn't reinvent the ways of that.Don't get me wrong, it's a highly entertaining and satisfying romp of graphic horror, okay comedy and high budget sound & looks, it's just that it's not much of a memorable movie, and I couldn't call it unique under any duress.

There's a likable hero (Samara Weaving) facing off against an unlikable villain family of psychotic satanic kooks.Psychotic satanic kooks, you say? Right, so what happens is the hero marries into a rich family who has amassed its fortune in games (think Parker Brothers or Milton Bradley). When the family insists that the wedding night end with a game, the hero views it as a quirky but harmless escapade. Oh, how wrong she is. Because of her misfortune of randomly drawing the card to play Hide and Seek, the entire family now believes they must kill her before dawn or suffer the wrath of a gamesman spirit that is responsible for their family fortune, or something like that. The details of the plotdon't matter a great deal other than to understand that the family is trying to kill her, so she runs around in a wedding dress trying to survive.Tonally, the movie is much more funny and exciting than it is scary. Even if you frighten easily, you should be able to tolerate this one. Though, a fair warning is needed about the violence. There's a lot of that. Much of it is comic violence, but a queasy stomach might act up anyway. Again, I'm just giving a fair warning.In a world where everything is politicized, you might have seen some people doing so with this movie. To me, that's a bit of a reach. At most, I would admit there is some fairly obvious social commentary, as the rich family members ridicule and look down their noses at this woman who isn't wealthy and is marrying into their world. The groom's aunt takes particularly aim at the bride, attacking her with her eyes and then later on literally attacking her with an axe.The message is clear, but I didn't bother exploring it too deeply because the movie doesn't appear to be asking for that from viewers. What I would encourage viewers to do instead is to enjoy the marvelous work of Weaving as she fights for her life in the most charming way possible. She's an absolute star, and the movie does not succeed if she is not able to balance being equal parts tough, cunning, and amused by the absurdity of her situation.","

"Ready or Not","gortx","7 September 2019","This would be cheeky satire using a game of deadly Hide and Seek as a metaphor for the vanity of the upper class isn't as clever as it thinks it is, although it does have it's moments. Samara Weaving is Grace, who marries into the rich eccentric family of Alex (Mark O'Brian). Alex doesn't prepare his bride for her wedding night - a game of chance that must be played in order to keep the family tradition alive (conveniently, Grace doesn't bring along any family or friends of her own).
Turns out, this wedding's game mixes Hide & Seek with The Most Dangerous Game -- Grace isn't just to be 'found' but hunted down like prey (Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None is also name-checked). Alex's family are a ghoulish lot with Andie MacDowell and Henry Czerny as his parents, Nicky Guadagni as a nasty aunt along with others including new sister in laws played by Elyse Levesque and Melanie Scrofano. Adam Brody is Alex' close brother Daniel.
The plot doesn't get much more complicated than the set-up, but those with a sick sense of humor (guilty), will find some devilish delights in the gruesome goings on. Writers Gary Busick and Ryan Murphy (no, not THAT one) along with co-Directors Matt Bettini-Olpin and Tyler Gillett try to add a layer of social commentary about the rich and their lack of empathy, but, it's extremely weak tea. Any real bite is severely undermined by resorting to various versions of F-Bombs. Deep.
Weaving makes for a plucky heroine. The actors are game, and the Production Design (Andrew Stearn) is suitably creepy and garish. There are some genuine laughs and some scattered suspense, it's just unfortunate that more care wasn't give to creating a more cohesive tone and, most certainly, another polish of the screenplay. Ready or Not? Mainly: ""or"".","

"Ready or Not","sbob322","23 August 2019","Went and saw this with my dad since we both love horror and horror comedy is my favorite genre. The story is laid out for you in the trailers. Girl marries into a family trying to kill and she fights back. We both loved the dark humor it was on point maybe could have used a little more but still was a nice balance. The violence and gore was well used and not really over the top till the end but used for some good humor. Little dissapointed the writers didn't go for a different ending for some characters but talking with my dad he dissagrees and felt the it was great and I can see his point of view. Overall it was a great movie I highly recommend. I was sad we were the only people in the theater for this gem. Also been really digging the main actresses work recently look forward to seeing more from her.","

"Ready or Not","redroominparis","16 June 2020","Very poorly written, loaded with bad talent. I'm shocked Andie McDowell agreed to this. Adam Brody is ok, because he's doing the Adam Brody thing he does. The main character, Samara, spends way too much time growling and screaming in such a way that made pause it to watch you tube videos. It also seemed like the directors recycled scenes. I think they were going for shock value? I'm not sure. I guess the strengths could be set design, tough lighting job but pulled it off nicely. Worst, absolute worst performance by far was the Grandmother. You could tell the actor was extremely uncomfortable with the garbage script, cliche lines. She probably is classically trained and needed the paycheck. It was probably fun to shoot though.","

"Ready or Not","mgwmusic","30 January 2020","Fun movie (certainly not a waste of time), but it could have been way better. Dialogue sucked. Too much overuse of profanity to try and sound modern/hip/cool. How about actually writing with some intelligence and vocabulary (I know, I know, it's really hard to look up words in an online thesaurus).This movie had a great mood/feeling throughout, but it lacked in some areas that would really make it better:1. The whole, everybody gets CGI zapped at the end was entirely too convenient (and not scary by the way - how about some disturbing practical effects? Which 99% of modern horror lacks - which is why they suck by the way).2. It would have been much more fun if the bride went on a vengeance rampage (à la You're Next). Instead, she basically, avoided everybody until dawn - meh.3. Also, the lore was a very interesting start, but they didn't dive in nearly enough, and it could have been so much cooler had they gone into the history & ""why"" of it more. Again the ending was too convenient and ""wrap-up for time's sake."" It would have been much better if they actually had the spirit show up (i.e. more than a stupid shadow in a chair) and actually wreak some havoc.4. I get that a lot of the movie was meant to be funny (and it honestly was in some parts), but unfortunately, it would have been better to just use it as comic relief, rather than stretching too thin on both parts (i.e. horror and comedy) and creating a basically watered down horror movie with no real tension.","

"Ready or Not","Indyrod","5 April 2020","Last night I had the pleasure of watching one of the best horror comedies I have ever seen. I'm not all that much of a fan of most horror comedy movies, but ""Ready or Not"" completely knocked me out. Not only is it loaded with blood and gore in abundance, but the story or script is very very good, as is the acting. The movie is about a couple getting married, the male being from a very rich family and the couple is going to the family's estate to meet his family for a celebration. At midnight the bride has to participate in a game, depending on a card the bride picks that signifies what game it will be. this is a ritual the family does anytime a new member is introduced to the family. The only problem, a very big problem, is the card the bride draws is the worst one possible. The bride thinks it is just a hide and seek game, but it turns out, the family now has to kill her before the Sunrise. Then the fun starts, and so do the laughs. I just loved this movie, not only is it fun to watch this bumbling family trying to find and kill her, the blood and gore effects are top notch. If you haven't seen this jewel, I strongly suggest you do, I can almost guarantee you'll be totally entertained, unless the blood and gore is too much for you.","

"Ready or Not","richardwworkman","26 March 2021","At first glance this is an entertaining shoot 'em up, pursuit horror but the weird family incorporating an innocent to suit some dastardly plan echos Get Out.It's no surprise that the family in question are rich through inheritance, bloated with a sense of superiority and misguided exceptionalism. Remind you of any other powerful American family?The Trumpian sense of uselessness among the trappings of weirdly Edwardian opulence gave this film a brilliant comic edge. Each attempt to fulfil a bizarre prophecy is thwarted by slapstick levels of incompetence.The final girl inevitably comes good although, quite rightly given the plot of the film, this is more by accident than design.If you don't fancy the political commentary undertone to this it's easy enough to switch off and just enjoy the glorious bloody mess. There's some very realistic injury detail and gore for the horror aficionados.","

I also loved the cinematography, the character development, the acting, and the scenarios, the technical aspects are almost Oscar worthy.The weakest thing in my opinion was the rushed ending, I would give more 10 minutes instead to finish the movie in a bloody and fast way.Avoid the trailer (or try to forget it) because it shows a lot of important scenes and some funny jokes. Because Ready or Not is surely one of the most thrilling experiences of this year.","

"Ready or Not","bastos","16 March 2021","As an avid horror fest goer I usually like these gory, fun, gimmicky kind of movies, but here, some inconsistencies make it just a near hit for me. The main problem, in my opinion, is the main character, as she has an alarming lack of development in the script department and she's neither cool nor badass enough for the underdevelopment not to be an issue. She's just there, annoying and oblivious to almost everything, playing this game and you're supposed to root for her. The family is a bit better treated by the screenplay, as most of them are well established if a bit cliched, and you can understand more or less their motivations while being actually funny. Another minor thing I didn't like was the inconsistency of the game, as at first it was just a normal hide and seek game but later on there is this ritual you're supposed to do, which makes absolutely no sense at all, I really hated that. Other than that it is fun and entertaining with a very memorable ending that redeems most of the faults throughout.","

"Ready or Not","hamanoooo23","28 August 2019","Not gonna lie, the concept seemed interesting and original with potential. However, execution was terrible. It starts off well with proper horror vibes that kept me on the edge of my seat right until the first 'accidental' death of one of the maids. It was at this point that I knew it was going downhill. By the time they got to the third maid's death, I was ready to leave.The excessive comic relief scenes were completely unnecessary and made me cringe. I still don't get how/why movies try to incorporate comedy in horror films because they're two conflicting genres that defeat each other's purpose. What's worse is that the characters were extremely unfunny and the deaths were ridiculous, therefore taking away the fright factor (if it existed).But the worst part has got to be the ending. So they were right all along and as a result, they all died in a comical way? Ha ha? We barely got to see any kills in the movie. Why kill all these characters in one stupid scene instead of using them to make a good horror film with several separate deaths.Overall, the movie was absolute garbage. Seemed like a mix of Get Out and the Cabin in the Woods but A LOT worse. All the high ratings are probably from teenagers or people with low IQs that find comedic horror films 'entertaining'.","

Second, there is not an original story here, is quite boring. Same story in a house told a hundred times in a hundred different ways.
Third, the script is a joke. Weird decisions from the characters and stupid deaths.
Lastly, the ending is quite original, but the execution is pretty bad. No tension or something similiar. Predictable. So, overall just an OK movie.","

The plot is fantastic and original and the cast did a superb job portraying a twisted family. The main actress did also a great job, her stress and shock seemed so authentic. Only reason why I'm not giving this a 9/10 is because some of the plot twists didn't make sense to me. The characters wad sudden ""change-of-hearts"" which were illogical in my opinion. But other wise this is a solid horror-comedy with fun gore and great comedic moments. You have to watch this!","

"Ready or Not","paul-allaer","8 September 2019","""Ready Or Not"" (2019 release; 95 min.) brings the story of Grace and the Le Domas family. As the movie opens, we see two young boys running around in a large mansion, only to see a guy get shot by bow and arrow. Is it real? or just play? We then go to ""30 Years Later"", and we get to know Grace, who is rehearsing her wedding vows. She is set to marry Alex Le Domas, on of the boys we saw in the opening scene. After the wedding ceremony, Alex informs Grace that according to family tradition, they will play a game starting at midnight. By luck of the draw, Grace gets ""Hide and Seek""... At this point we are 10 min, into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by up-and-coming Matt Betinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, who previously brought us ""Devil's Due"". Here they bring what turns out to be a traditional ""horror"" movie, albeit with a slightly black comedy twist. From the get-go it all appears so straight-forward, and hence I expected a major plot twist or some other significant departure from this tried-and-true genre. Alas, it didn't happen and hence I felt a bit let down: was this supposed to be scary? or funny? Bottom line is that it is neither. The movie benefits significantly from Australian actress Samara Weaving's breakout role as Grace. Surely we have not seen the last of her. Check out Andie McDowell (in the role of Alex's mother), who remains as lovely as ever. But other than that, this movie just felt average to me: not really bad, but nowhere near as good as, say, the similarly themed ""Get Out"".""Ready Or Not"" was released wide a few weeks ago, and now in its third weekend, I finally went to see it here in Cincinnati. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was not attended well (6 people in total). This movie has been getting great reviews (it's currently rated 87% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), and I must admit that I am a bit dumbfounded by that as for me there really was nothing special about this movie. But if you like horror-with-comedy films, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on COD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","

This is The Most Dangerous Game if Tarantino got his hands on it. So in some ways the initial develpment is a bit predictable, and not always fully credible, but those would be the only weaknesses. You'll have a good laugh if you're into black humor. You'll have a jump or two from the edge of the seat. Bends a few genres in a similar way to movies like Cabin in the Woods, Get Out, or maybe even Mother!, but is probably a bit funnier than all of those","

You caught her n u could readily kill her right there. And that should be the end of the story. But then u brought her back for a time-consuming ritual? Hell yeah then u gave her plenty of time n chances to change her fate. I really can't come to a clue.But other than this big plot hole, I quite enjoy the dark comedy and the thriller atmosphere of the whole movie. It won't make my heart beats faster, and it won't stun my brain for even once, but I love the dark, strange and survival horror in a combination.I would recommend it if you have free Friday night for it.","

"Ready or Not","jboothmillard","6 October 2019","I saw the trailer at least four times before the film's release, it looked like a good concept for a scary movie, and I'm glad it received positive reviews, including from Mark Kermode, so I was really looking forward to it. Basically, the wealthy Le Domas family hosts a generations-long tradition of playing a game at midnight on the wedding night with each new addition to the family. In a flashback many years ago, young Alex Le Domas (Chase Churchill) and his brother Daniel (Etienne Kellici) witness the killing of a man named Charles (Andrew Anthony), who has just married their aunt Helene (Elana Dunkelman). Thirty years later, Grace (Samara Weaving, Hugo's niece) is the newest addition to the Le Domas family, having married Alex (Mark O'Brien), who has been estranged from the family for years. Alex is hesitant to be back at the family estate, but Grace reassures him and is eager to become part of his family. Following the wedding ceremony, Grace is informed of the family initiation custom and meets with the rest of the in-laws. Participating in the tradition with the happy couple are Alex's alcoholic brother Daniel (Adam Brody), father Tony (Henry Czerny), mother Becky (Andie MacDowell), Daniel's snobbish wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), Alex's drug-addicted sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano), Emilie's whiny husband Fitch Bradley (Kristian Bruun), and Tony's older sister, the sombre Helene (Nicky Guadagni). Tony is told that she must draw a card from a mysterious wooden box and play whatever game is written on the card with the family and become a member of the ""dominion"". Tony tells the story of his great-grandfather Victor Le Domas, who made a deal with a man named Mr. Le Bail, who helped to create the Le Domas fortune if the family established the tradition. Grace draws from the box a card that reads ""Hide and Seek."" Grace believes the game is harmless, she will be hiding while the other family members seek. While she leaves to hide in the estate, the Le Domas family, excluding Alex, arm themselves with antique weapons to hunt her down. Alex manages to find Grace before his family, they witness Emilie accidentally kill a maid, shooting her in the head with a shotgun. Alex didn't tell Grace about the Le Domas tradition, believing says the odds of Hide and Seek being chosen being unlikely, it is the only game that would prompt the family to try to kill Grace. The Le Domas family believes that if they fail to kill Grace before dawn, they will all die as part of the deal with Mr. Le Bail (whose name is an anagram of Belial, an alias for Satan), decades earlier. Grace is shocked and angry with Alex at not telling her about the ritual, but he feared she would leave him. Against his family's wishes, Alex promises Grace he will help her escape, he heads to the house's security room and tells Grace to go to the kitchen. While looking for the exit, Grace encounters a second maid, she accidentally activates the mechanical dumbwaiter elevator and kills the maid. Daniel, who is also against the family tradition, finds Grace in the study. She pleads with him for help, but he says he has no choice, but offers her a ten-second head start before he alerts the others. Alex deactivates the security cameras and unlocks the doors of the house. However, he is captured and restrained by the family when they discover his betrayal. Grace tears her wedding gown to free her legs for mobility and arms herself. She manages to escape the kitchen after eluding the family butler Stevens (John Ralston), scalding him with boiling water. The family members regroup and lament the difficulty in killing Grace but reiterate they must do so before sunrise. During this discussion, Emilie accidentally kills a third maid with a crossbow through the head. Stevens informs the family Grace has escaped outside but promises to capture her. Grace hides in the barn, there she is shot in the hand by Emilie's son Georgie (Liam MacDonald), falling into the ""goat pit"" where the family have hidden the remains of previous victims. Grace manages to climb out and escapes through a fence, injuring herself further, and fails to stop a passing motorist for help. On the road, Stevens chases after Grace in a car, but she manages to temporarily disable him and takes the car after gets out. She tries to call for help using the vehicle assistance company, but the car was reported stolen and the car is disable remotely, allowing Stevens to tranquilize and capture Grace. Stevens drives her back to the estate, but Grace wakes up and causes him to crash the car, killing him. Grace runs, but Daniel discovers her, knowing that Tony is secretly watching, he knocks her out again and recaptures her. The Le Domas family prepares to sacrifice Grace in a Satanic ritual. They each drink from a cup as part of the ritual, but vomit, besides Daniel who has poisoned them all, saying they deserve to die. While Alex escapes his captivity, Daniel frees Grace and they attempt to leave the house. But Daniel is shot and killed by Charity. Grace starts a fire, but the family members ignore it and continue to pursue her. She gets into a fight with Becky and manages to beat her to death with the box. Alex arrives and realises that, even if he lets Grace live, she won't want to be with him, he captures her and alerts the family. The family try again to sacrifice Grace, holding her down. Alex tries to stab her in the heart but misses and stabs her in shoulder. They then see that the sun has come up, meaning it is now too late. As they recoil in horror for their impending death, nothing happens. Helene plans to kill Grace anyway, but as she grabs the axe, she suddenly explodes into a bloody mess. One by one, the other family members look in horror and try to flee as each blow up. Tony pleads for a reprieve to Mr. Le Bail, but to no avail and dies. Last to go, Alex begs Grace for forgiveness, but explodes when Grace demands a divorce. As the house is engulfed in flames, Grace momentarily sees the figure of Mr. Le Bail sitting at the head of the table. He nods in approval and allows her to leave, covered in the blood of the exploded Le Domas family members. Outside the house, Grace sits on the steps as the fire blazes behind her and smokes a cigarette as emergency services arrive. When someone asks her what happened, Grace shrugs and replies: ""In-laws"". Also starring Kate Ziegler as Young Becky. Weaver gives a fantastic as the unsuspecting bride who inadvertently becomes the victim of a deadly game, the other cast members, including an against-type MacDowell, play the aristocratic family with a dark agenda very well. The twisted game of Hide and Seek is the main draw, and the deal with the devil element is clever, there are some thrilling moments, but it not just tense, it is also witty and very funny, with the madness and slaughter being the butt of the joke, a great fun black comedy horror. Very good!","

A woman (Samara) getting married into her husband family, who has crazy rituals - hide and seek and kill the one's hiding.But the suspense and horror and plots are well made.

It's watchable, that I'll admit, there is a bit of suspense, but other than that it's just not a movie I would keep in my collection. Horror and comedy can work but in this case I would just have skipped the comedy part. It was unnecessary and to be honest not that funny. The acting was good for some but bad for others, so even that was disappointing. I read somewhere reviewers comparing it to Get Out, really? If you never seen that one I recommend you that movie. Get Out has everything this movie doesn't have. That's a good movie and not this one.","

"Ready or Not","pjlb2008","9 September 2019","Nice use of a flashback to set up the mood of the story. Excellent setup as a horror/drama. Neat mansion with colorful characters. Likeable characters at first. Clueless bride slowly (understatement) begins to figure out something is amiss with her new inlaws. Fairly quickly turns into a nonstop chase that begins to bore. Interspersed with creepy humor. The ""humor"" involves the senseless killing of several employees of the family. Not very funny to repeatedly see the villains callously killing people and smirking about it. This movie would have been better without this type of humor. The person being chased must not have ever seen a horror movie before! If she ran like her life depended on it rather than as a soon-to-be dead teenager in a Friday the 13th movie. The pursuers were ineffectual. I was somewhat entertained. I would never watch the movie again and did not care what happened by the end of the movie. Just okay.

"Ready or Not","WasiReviews","24 January 2021","Ready or Not is a horror movie that is both unique and entertaining with the film feeling like Game Night meets the third act of Cabin in the Woods ( not a spoiler). Samara Weaving and Adam Brody were great. I loved how incompetent the family was shown to be, it implies that the only reason for their continued wealth and success was the deal. Her dress getting destroyed symbolizes her innocence slowly fading due to the stuff she had to endure throughout the night. I think the fact that Grace is ""good"" is directly correlated with her getting the hide and seek card. The family worships the devil, therefore the original patriarch wouldn't want such a good genuine person to join the family. Notice how the other two spouses of the siblings aren't very good people, therefore they got to join no problems. Melanie Scrofano as Emilie Le Domas-Bradley, Daniel and Alex's cocaine-addicted sister was flipping hilarious I loved her soo much in this she felt like a dumb blonde character (she has brown hair though) but she isn't overplayed or overtly stupid like Madison in Zombieland Doubletap who I hated with a vengeance. Overall this film wasn't that scary but I will say it was thoroughly entertaining and incredibly gory this is not something a 13-year-old should watch. This is very much a satanic film with worship and brutality. Trust me the gore and devil references are very strong. All the actors and some Canadians (GO CANADA) brought their best act in this film. I can't name them all but I truly thought all of them were great in this film.","

Some didn't even finish more than 10 minutes and yet feel adequate to trash it. Some don't like profanity in a movie where so many people die. Some find it unoriginal, as there is much room left for originality.
Let me just say this. The movie is not perfect. The main character is not always perfect in her decisions. Seeing ""normal"" people getting crazy because of the card is not that believable. The last minute and the paranormal touch is a bit of mess (they exploded? would be better if they burned or melted, not some quick death).
But the movie is still smart, fun, scary, funny, gory, and very well made. 7.5/10, but in spite of haters, 8/10!","

"Ready or Not","GavWaskett","12 September 2020","The Le Domas' have an interesting family history, their ancestor made a deal with a man named Le Bail(French for a Lease if you want a bit of trivia and Le Domas means thought - my Google translate is working overtime today), their family fortune developed from that moment, however, as with all dodgy deals with people you don't know who promise you riches, there is a catch! Every time one of the family marries, they all sit around and the new Le Domas, selects a card with a game on it.Now this card selection, often leads to fin and games and a wedding night to remember, however, ever so often someone pulls out the 'Hide and Seek' card and then what should be for the happy couple a night to remember, becomes a night one part will never forget and the other part, well they won't have the chance to forget!And to this warped family, comes Grace (Samara Weaving), the new wife of Alex (Mark O'Brien), poor Grace, selects the one card that causes problems and the fun and games begin. To be honest, most of the family take more than a little bit of enjoyment from hunting the poor woman and taking pot shots at her. However, she does have the occasional bit of help from some unlikely quarters.Samara Weaving is superb as Grace, portraying her fear, shock and ultimately her feck you attitude. She is the heroine you root for and you quickly turn against the family to support her. Adam Brody as alcoholic brother Daniel is fantastic and his vulnerability and torn relationships are a nice contrast to his bloodthirsty wife Charity (Elyse Levesque), who you cannot help but feel, if she pulled the Hide and Seek card, things would've been a whole lot bloodier, a whole lot quicker and brother in law Bradley (Kristian Bruun) who loves the family money but is a little bit more choosy and his instrument of death. Both Miss Levesque and Mr Bruun create very fun and watchable characters who add to the horror and fun. You also have Andie MacDowell, as the matriarch of the family who just wants to protect her brood.The film is fast, fun and bloody, you really wouldn't want to be a maid at this party - the tips you receive are on the end of a crossbow blot! There are a few queasy moments, a nail at the top of a ladder springs to mind and there's some awesome death scenes. A really fresh idea as well, which in the time of remakes and sequels is really refreshing, a hide behind your hands and count to 17/20.","

"Ready or Not","stevendbeard","22 August 2019","I saw ""Ready or Not"", starring Samara Weaving-Three Billboards Outside Ebbing,Missouri, Ash vs Evil_tv, Oh and if her name sounds familiar, it's because she is the niece of Hugo Weaving/Mr. Smith, from the Matrix movies; Adam Brody-Shazam!, The O.C._tv; Mark O'Brien-Bad Times at the El Royale, Arrival; Henry Czerny-Revenge_tv, Mission:Impossible and Andie MacDowell-Magic Mike XXL, Groundhog Day.
This is a bloody, funny tale about In_laws From Hell. Samara is a poor girl marrying Mark, a man that comes from a rich family-they made their fortune in games-but he forgets to tell her about a family tradition. At midnight, on their wedding night, his family welcomes a new person into their family by playing a game. They draw cards to see what they will play, it could be Checkers, Old Maid or in this case, Hide & Seek. Henry & Andie are Mark's parents and Adam is Mark's brother. Mark tells Samara that they should just elope-he can't tell her why because of his family and their rules-but Samara wants to be accepted by the family and decides to play the game. Henry tells Samara that the rules of the game are that she must stay hidden until dawn. Samara soon finds out that the game is being played seriously and they are really trying to kill her before dawn or there will be consequences for the seekers. Although it is violent and bloody, there are lots of humor in it, too. There aren't any scenes at the end but if you do stay, there is someone that says, 'Ready or not, here I come!' at the very end.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, bloody images, language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.","

People in the cinema were laughing out loud most of the way through, and not in a good way!I only went to see this as an Odeon 'screen unseen' in the U.K. and because I have a cinema pass. If I had paid my £14 for a ticket, I would have been very unhappy about it. As it was, my companions got in for £5 each, which is all this film is worth.If you've seen a genuinely scary film, you'll want to give this a miss.

"Ready or Not","Coventry","2 July 2020","They're going to find her. And make her suffer...Sorry, but when you see that title, how can you not automatically complete the lyrics of the 1996 smash-hit by The Fugees? Anyway, ""Ready or Not"" is a very entertaining and surprisingly competent action/horror ride with a strong feminine protagonist, a healthy dose of humor and a handful of inventively gory gimmicks. I state ""surprisingly"" competent, because thus far I only knew the directors Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Oplin from the anthologies ""Southbound"" and ""V/H/S"" and, well, I though they both sucked. This film blends two very familiar horror themes, namely hunting for humans and severely dysfunctional murder-families, but present them in a very fun and enjoyable format. Grace and Daniel celebrate their wedding's day at Daniel's parental estate. It's the first time the bride meets her in-laws, and basically only knows they are a bunch of eccentric rich people whose empire is built on generations of successful boardgames development. At midnight, and according to an ancient tradition, Grace must participate in a game of hide and seek before she's fully accepted into the family. Her wedding night will be wild and nasty, but probably not how she imagined it. If you look past some flaws and improbabilities (like some of the characters implausible behavioral changes) you'll find this an enjoyable movie. The grotesque and bloody finale is hilarious, the hide-and-seek nursery tune is creepy, and the performances are good. It's particularly fun to see Andie MacDowell is a highly unusual role for a change. I swear you'll never look at ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" in the same way again.","

"Ready or Not","rockman182","21 August 2019","Hide and seek gone terribly wrong. That's basically the premise for this film. It looked like it could be an extravagant little affair but at the same time looked like a film that could be awfully disappointing. By now, you know me and know that I don't turn down seeing any film and will watch pretty much anything. Ready or Not was no exception. I did enjoy the theme and gory cat and mouse for the most part in this film although the film does drag itself down when it tries to delve too much into its characters.The film is about a recently married couple, where the bride is spending the wedding night with her husbands mysterious but rich family. The family proposes to honor an age old tradition and play a game where the bride draws a card and they fulfill the game. She draws ""hide and seek"" which turns out to be a bloody, murderous game where the bride must hide as members of her in law family try to murder her before dawn to avoid a curse that will occur to them.The film delivers on its dark humor, gothic mansion setting, and humor here and there which is great because its what the film needs. Samara Weaving is a star in the making and I'm all for it. She is a character you back to escape and she really gets into the element that the role requires. The film brings a good amount of blood and violence which will satisfy those looking for an entertaining thriller. The film does spend too much time trying to have moments of ""emotion"" between characters and its winded and feels like it.The film becomes utterly ridiculous as it goes along but its hard to look away. Its a different type of film and I had a pretty good time with it which is all I could hope for from a B movie that only exists to be humorous, violent fun. If you want a fun tale of survival over the course of a night then this will do the trick. Just don't expect anything amazing. Side note, its nice to see Adam Brody from The O.C. all grown up.6.5/10","

So dull and boring, even the 'action scenes' were slow and dragged out. You know when you're watching a great film when the time flies by, but this film felt 6 hours long!People shouting and ranting at the top of their voices is what passes for comedy.It's just awful.","

"Ready or Not","Catocala","31 October 2022","Ready or Not is one of those movies that really knows what it is and doesn't pretend to be more than that. The plot is so ridiculous (in-laws force the bride to play a lethal version of hide and seek), but it makes no attempt to pretend to be deep or revolutionary. It just knows what it wants and does its job well.You get the jokes, you get the thrill, you get the over-the-top gore. A dark-comedy with great execution and pretty decent acting. Especially Samara Weaving as the leading lady, really is a leading lady and carries most of the movie when it comes to the acting.I was doubting to give this movie a 7 because it's good within its niche genre, but it is one of those movies that's fun to watch once and nothing really surprising happens. Good entertainment, what you see is what you get, but nothing more than that.","

Next I do know how 16k voters have rated this a 7 or higher. Are they going to do this for all the movies in the future we already had female reboots of Ghostbusters and one of the Oceans franchise and they were horrible. I wish that this movie was an original idea but it isn't nothing anymore is original it's all reboots,remakes, and stealing ideas of the past.I knew form reading the synopsis it made me think Get Out 2 and I see from other reviews others felt the same.

"Ready or Not","fntstcplnt","28 August 2019","Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpen & Tyler Gillett. Starring Samara Weaving, Mark O'Brien, Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, Andie MacDowell, Nicky Guadagni, Elyse Levesque, Melanie Scrofano, Kristian Bruun, John Ralston, Hanneke Talbot. (R)Weaving marries into the fabulously wealthy Le Domas clan, unaware of their unusual tradition of playing a game after each family wedding; the game this time is hide-or-seek, and these upper class rapscallions play for keeps. Delicious black comedy disguised as a horror movie has lots of devilish laughs and plentiful bloodletting; not quite as clever as one might hope, and the chase is more fitful than fluid (almost like one of the board games that made the family its fortune), but it's still good, grisly fun all the way with some sly potshots at class and heritage. The groom (O'Brien) has the personality of wallpaper (the absence of relationship chemistry between him and his new bride is unfortunate) and Brody's conflicted drunk can be a buzzkill as often as a laconic wag, but the rest of the sordid family each have their share of wicked (and wickedly funny) moments; the deadliest weapon brandished onscreen is Guadagni's hysterically withering glare. Weaving, however, steals the show as the most memorable bride-on-the-brink since Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill""; based on the evidence here, she's a star in the making. The audacious climax is a high-wire act that could have easily turned disastrous; it may not completely stick the landing, but one has to admire its macabre moxie.75/100","

"Ready or Not","cruise01","3 September 2019","Ready or Not (4 out of 5 stars).Ready or Not is a bloody fun time with a cheesy concept idea and plot and some suspense and thrills. Kind of like a cheesy horror movie like Cabin in the Woods. A simple and weird plot idea. But throw in some cheesy script and direction which does make it entertaining. Ready or Not worked with the idea.The plot follows Grace (Samara Weaving) who got married to Alex (Mark O'Brien) whose family is rich and have an empire in the gaming business. The family has a weird tradition on the wedding night. Grace has to play a game and this mystery box tells them they have to play hide and seek. With a twist. She has to hide and the family has their set of weapons and they have to go hunting for her.There is a little more to plot that reveals the family true reasoning with the game. Which has a family history of a tradition that they have to do. There is a twist that gets very bloody in the climax. Literally from the characters getting stabbed to fighting back. Even bodies exploding. Feels like Quentin Tarantino idea of a movie.The movie moves at a fast pace. Grace is on the run and avoiding the family until dawn. Every encounter has her fighting for her life and avoiding danger. While the family is slowly losing control of their hunting game. Which they are very desperate in trying to get her before dawn. Before something else happens.The script is a bit cheesy with the acting and funny. The direction also delivers some thrills and suspense. Not really scary at all. Samara Weaving delivered a great performance. Probably the most freaked out performance of the year. Love how her character is wearing the bride dress throughout. Until, she gets worn down and messy and bloody while trying to survive. Adam Brody also delivered playing Daniel, which he is the brother in law who is tired from the family tradition.Overall, Ready or Not is a good thriller of a film. It delivers plenty of thrilling moments and some cheesy humor. It can be a bit bloody. The story is cheesy with its set up but at least it is fun.","

"Ready or Not","rgkarim","21 August 2019","Robbie K back in the trenches for another movie review, this time looking at yet another horror movie to hopefully bring with a number of warped imaginations to life. Some of them bring us into the disturbing zone and leave us scarred, others manage to be quirky cult thrillers that lead to endless sequels, and others are so bad they somehow stay good. Tonight, the horror movie looks to be a hybrid of a thriller meeting said horror, with promise of being a romping good time. Yet, the trailers can certainly be a mask for something else. Read on to check out my thoughts on:Movie: Ready or Not (2019)Directors:
Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett

Guy Busick, Ryan Murphy
Stars:
Samara Weaving, Adam Brody, Mark O'Brien
LIKES:Good Acting

Funny
Lives Pretty Close To What The Trailer PromisesDISLIKES:Predictable
Not Scary
A Little Too Silly
The Ending Sort Of
Focus On Blood at timesSummary:We get that these types of movies often do not have the best acting, but in this film the cast actually brings some effort into making believable characters that aren't too annoying. My lead is Samara Weaving who has the comical role down, but Adam Brody is a solid second actor to craft the believable brother struggling to handle the situation before them. As the rest of the cast plays essentially sadistic players in the mad games of chance, these carbon copy roles are all about trying to bring the suspense factor to the movie. Ready Or Not achieves the suspense decently, keeping a nice pace to keep the action going and the horrors at least coming. Thus, the thriller aspect is very well achieved in this movie. Yet, another element that I liked was the quirkiness of this film, primarily in the form of the presentation. Ready or Not is one of those movies that manages to find a stride with the cheesy gimmicks, putting a comedic spin on things without being too forced in your face. Perhaps it's the subtle comedy of the overzealous aunt, the clumsiness of the sister, or maybe just the reactions of the main character Grace, but there is something in the writing and presentation that makes it just fun. As an added bonus, the film also manages to achieve pretty close what the trailer provides, leaving some surprises to enjoy, and yet still not diverging down the pathways it could have taken.In regards to dislikes, the predictability of the movie is okay, some parts due to the trailers and other parts laid out in writing with heavy foreshadowing. This predictability not only ruins some of the surprise, but it also diminished the horror element of the movie as well. Ready Or Not's thriller is the selling point, for the jump scares are few, the creep factor is low, and there are seldom any moments that had me on the edge of my seat. This could also be due to the comical side of things and the fact they focused so much on the ridiculousness of the plot to help tone down the creep and scare factor. Maybe taking things the silly route wasn't the best route for this one, especially giving the ending, which to me is a mixed like and dislike. On the one hand the ending falls in line with the silliness of the movie and sort of just naturally occurs leaving you satisfied. On the other hand, the movie's ending led to not quite getting the hunt fest I had thought I was going to see. Like the most dangerous game or a final destination I had kind of thought members of this household would have altercations that were do or die. Yet as you will see, this in not quite the case and there is little more I can say without ruining anything so onward we move. My final component is the gore factor of this movie. Certainly not the worst thing, Ready Or Not does sometimes get a little too fixated on the blood factor for my tastes. Those who aren't fans of seeing suffering, skin crawling spectacles of crimson colored chaos need to turn away, as there are some gut-wrenching moments that aren't for the faint hearted.Overall, the adventure of Ready Or Not is a fun little project that is campy, quirky, and still thrilling in the world of horror films. With an engaging cast and concept, it's a movie that will keep the audience hooked and perhaps make them laugh at the odd sense of comedy and justice that they brought in this film. And though it matches the tone of the trailers, at times the comedy may have diluted the thriller anticipation you might have though. For the hunt sort of gets caught up in the blood and comedy rather than delivering the full-on horror chills. Still, the film is a fun watch and probably good for a small group to hit the theaters with or watch at home.My scores are:Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0","

"Ready or Not","aciessi","25 August 2019","Ready or Not is exactly what the end of summer needed. A quietly released indie that comes alive on the screen as an old-fashioned horror bloodbath. Take Clue and The Most Dangerous Game, and mash them together. You'll get this. Olpin and Gillett are a directing duo to continue looking out for. Once the games begin, they make sure to keep the hits coming. In Samara Weaving, a star is born, again. She's horror's next big scream queen. No really, she's got an EPIC shriek. For a lack of better phrasing. Just as fun to watch is Henry Cherny as the wildly over-the-top Le Domas patriarch. Aside from some minor character issues, this film has a nice flow throughout, with increasing adrenaline and tension. While at the same time, teeming with self-awareness and gleeful fun.","

director: Tyler Gillet and Matt bettelini olpin
Starring: Samara Weaving,Adam Brody,Mark O brien,Henry Czerny,Andie Macdowell etcoverall rating 56/100
Ready or not is based on a loving couple called Grace ( Samara Weaving) and Alex ( Mark o brien) but in order to be accepted into into the family Grace must play a game with them with drastic and disturbing consequences for everyone. Ready or not had such a big potential to be good but largely fell flat for me the film was just mediocre. Lets talk about why.Lets start with a positive however. The plot was fairly unique and something i hadn't seen before. The whole plot was interesting to me. Having a family so adamant that they have to kill anyone who comes into the family was an interesting concept. And it made the film enjoyable for doing something different despite the poor execution.Next i thought the use of gore was fantastic. The gore really left an impact with each scene that it was in. It also really kept you on the edge of your seat as there was some admittedly uncomfortable scenes involving crushing of bones. But that just shows the director is achieving there desired reaction. And i thought the gore looked surprisingly realistic despite its very small budget.Next however i would like to say that the film was painfully predictable. Pretty much every character had the generic role within the film and hardly any of them stood out in a interesting way at all. You
could tell what was going to happen at the end because they told you what would happen so therefore most of the film was pretty pointless. It was a shame as the plot was different its just the ingredients within the plot everyone had seen before.Next despite in my opinion the film being tonally unsure about what genre it is the film was actually pretty funny. Despite some of the characters such as the loopy one who accidentally kills everyone was admittedly funny despite it maybe not supposed to be funny. It was a strange one as i felt that the film was more of a comedy but i don't know or think this was the movies goal. And it had moments with the acting and the script where it was so bad it was good/funny.Adding onto the previous point the script for this film was absolutely terrible. Some of the things that most of the characters was ridiculous and cringey. It made a large majority of the characters seem incredibly dumb. The script was fairy strong for the lead actress but it just felt like they didn't bother with any of the other characters.Next i thought the acting from the lead actors Mark o brian and Samara weaving was pretty good. Both of there performances held the film together in my opinion. Mark o brien put on a very believable performance of the struggle between loyalty to his family and the love for his wife and he did solid acting here. But the real star of this film was Samara weaving. She was fantastic in Ready or not and should be a big star in the future. She did an excellent performance in portraying the slow mental breakdown of her character after slowly realising what family she married into. The script for her was fantastic and relatable and really made you connect with her character. And both of these characters bough a relatable and good theme about wanting to impress other members of the family and Ready or not tackled this very well. And the only other good performance and character was Adam Brody. He bought the most comedy and was the only family member that wasn't the two leads that did a good performance. You could tell throughout the film how conflicted he was in terms of were his loyalties lie and his death was admittedly sad.And my final positive before i get into the main points that bought the film down. The film did manage to execute a very tense tone well. The film despite lacking in jumpscares did have many tense scenes that were mostly achieved and elevated by Samara Weavings performance. The fact that you genuinely didn't know when a member of the family was going to find the lead protagonist was an interesting way at keeping the tense tone consistent we will get onto the overall tone soon.Now for my final three negatives that really bought the film down for me. First of all the film was completely tonally inconsistent. This movie did not know what genre it wanted to be at all. It was supposed to be a horror and a comedy but there was not enough of either in order to justify what the movie was trying to do. It wasn't that funny and it certainly wasn't scary and the film had some moments where it was supposed to be funny but it was just pure toe curling cringe. And the whole film just felt so amateurish. You could just tell the director was new to the game and didn't really know what they were doing.And finally there was many lapses in logic and the ending was just terrible. There was many scenes especially towards the end that were either ridiculous or did not make sense in the slightest. The lead character jumped a really high distance and was absolutely fine and considering the amount of injuries she sustained throughout the whole film i was surprised but glad she was alive. And the whole point of Adam brodys character poisining his family members was for Samara weaving character to escape but it literally did nothing to them despite him saying it will make them very drowsy. And finally the ending was terrible when Grace survived until dawn and nothing happened to the family it firstly made the characters and the film look stupid but there was just a massive awkward silence. And when they did explode like they said they would it just was ridiculous and made the whole film pointless.Overall Ready or not is held together by the fantastic performance by Samara weaving and had potential to be great. But fell flat due to poor directing,acting,execution of the plot and its tonal inconsistencies.","

"Ready or Not","NDbportmanfan","10 September 2019","Ready or Not is about a newly wed bride that has to play a game in order to officially be welcomed into the family. The game that is chosen is hide and seek, with the catch being if she is found... well you can tell from the trailers.The one thing this film really does well is keeping the tension high while also supplying well executed humor. Which is vitally crucial in a silly premise such as this one. The sister's husband plays a role that embodies the audience as he is questioning the games logic, pageantry, and real end game. His humor along with his wife really makes the movie memorable.Much like real hide and seek the entire thrill comes out of the high tension hiding moments and the sporadic running scenes. These are thrilling and they felt more intense because the writers wrote a character that seems a little deeper than other scream queens of the recent past. We are even given a character in Daniel that helps carry the story when she isn't in the picture.Once we get past all the thrill and kill moments comes the third act or more importantly the end. This had all the momentum going into it from the previous scenes, but the end just falls flat. Honestly they should have added another 20 minutes to this as I would assume audiences are wanting more to the lore, or maybe that is just me. Where it stands now its okay because it was out there and few probably would expect it but you will go away thinking it had a lot more potential.This movie should be watched but there is nothing spoiler heavy that waiting until a home release wouldn't be the most viable option. I can see myself watching this one again in the future.","

"Ready or Not","hnapel","24 November 2019","Samara Weaving, I'm not sure that is a household name already but after this I think it should be. All hail to the casting agencies who can find the perfect face for the perfect character. What I like about this movie, while it may not be exactly a horror story is its realism that is only violated in the very end but then it is executed which such perfect justice and accompanied by such ironic laughter from Samara that whoever came up with it is totally exonerated for its in-credulousness. This is a dark movie, bodies are drawn from the living at a steady pace and the killings are as brutal as they are fanciful. A head is chopped off with an ax I will give you and for the rest go watch it thank you very much. There's a dark kind of humor to psychopaths and this movie is full of it. The cringing, hurting moments invoke true horror because you can so easily relate to them, the strength of those scenes is that they are so close to the bone, the spine is a bone right? The movie stays close to the face of the main character, which is always a satisfaction when it is a pretty one, and in our desire to understand it we are exposed to all its evolving expressions as it attains more grit while the story develops in an ongoing escalation of violence. Believe me, the curse is real, this is a serious game.","

"Ready or Not","arungeorge13","1 December 2019","It'd been a while since I've sat down to watch a comedy-horror flick and when Ready or Not caught my attention, I was sure to give it a go. That said, I wasn't particularly fond of the director duo's earlier work - Devil's Due, and a segment (or was it two?) in Southbound and V.H.S. But the genre continues to intrigue me and that was the reason I decided to watch Ready or Not.For starters, my decision turned out to be a great one. Not only does Ready or Not manage to entertain for a good 95 minutes, but it also serves fair justice to the comedy-horror fanbase. Led by a fantastic Samara Weaving (playing Grace, who's just married and brought to her husband's house to partake in a rather uncanny midnight ritual) and a fantastic supporting cast (featuring the likes of Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, Andie MacDowell, and more), Ready or Not offers an engaging mix of dark humor and survival-horror.The storyline isn't the most original one you'll come across for a film such as this. Yet, the director-duo pack in enough twists and tricks to keep viewers engrossed throughout its run-time. The (another-level) dysfunctional family was both fun and creepy in their own ways. Weaving is in top form here, conveying the transition from yaay-just-married-bliss to straight-up-shocked in convincing fashion. I liked her (mostly improv) reactions in the latter half of the movie where she has to fend for herself while in an incredible amount of pain. Adam Brody is pretty great too, and thankfully, he doesn't take the thunder away from Weaving in any of their combination scenes.The mansion and its surroundings could have been creepier (the lighting is excellent and works in favor of the film's overall tone) but otherwise, I'd deem them okayish. The edits are crisp and that helps for a film which is set in a limited setting and the entire storyline is basically a one-liner. What works in Ready or Not lies in its execution of a concept that's low-hanging fruit these days: commonplace scenarios turning wacky all of a sudden, the one-too-many jabs at rich people and the extremes that they resort to, and a lady (in distress) at the forefront of it all.In essence, it may seem like the R-rated version of The Hunger Games with a few funny lines and situations thrown in, but Ready or Not gets the job done in amusing its viewers and sometimes, that's just about enough.",NA

"Ready or Not","Abranth-d","13 September 2019","Here's my review of 'Ready or not' . So 'ready or not stars Samara weaving who happens to be a Margot Robbie lookalike . The movie's about a girl who marries into a super rich family who have a tradition of playing a game , one of which involves playing hide and seek but the other members of the family have to kill her before Dawn . That's just about it. It's a neatly directed claustrophobic horror movie which has elements of black comedy in and out. That's something I loved about this movie. The tonal shift from funny to scary to weird is so fast in this movie and yet doesn't feel odd anywhere. The music was also gripping and helped with the setup for most jumpscares. I don't usually talk film school , but the lighting in this movie was gorgeous . The only gripes I had were with the use of shaky cam in certain scenes . Other than that , it was a pretty good b grade flick with gore , action and thrills. The ending however ... That was unexpected .",NA
"Ready or Not","bonehead821","21 August 2019","What I got was a very dry dark comedy that just basically gives up at the end (and wastes kills). As a hardcore slasher fan, I went in looking for some decent kills, and maybe a decent survivor girl, but you get none of that with this. I can't even remember one single kill. It was just a bunch of offscreen stuff and quick shots of aftermath gore.If you're a slasher fan looking for some good kills, skip this one, it's not made for you.",NA
"Ready or Not","carolinephillips-47427","23 August 2019","It's rare that a big, mainstream studio horror film comes out and actually delivers. Ready or Not is one of the rare cases when it does. Samara Weaving is a charming and likable heroine who must deal with her fiance's bizarre family wedding rituals that include a deadly game of hide and seek.Weaving's character doesn't get much in terms of backstory, which might have helped out a bit, but Weaving's abundance of charm and quirky tics make her feel better developed than she is and we're on her side the entire time.The supporting cast featuring familiar faces like Andie McDowell (in her horror film debut if I'm correct) and Adam Brody (who gets much more to do here than he did in his other horror comedies Scream 4 and Jennifer's Body).Throughout the film, you'll find yourself cringing at scenes of nails entering hands or people falling into messy pits of dead bodies in between laughing fits due to the witty dark comedy. Horror comedy is tricky to pull off, but Ready or Not pulls it off beautifully with a healthy amount of suspense and laughs in equal measure.Ready or Not is a must see horror-comedy event!",NA
"Happy Death Day","Sleepin_Dragon","23 September 2019","Jessica Rothe shines through in this tongue in cheek horror. It's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, the characters, means of death, and outlandish humour move it into the horror comedy genre.I loved the reference to Groundhog Day at the end of the film, I would imagine there was some sort of in joke there, and of course any film that involves the loop storyline will have reference to the great Bill Murray film.There were some great twists and turns, the best one coming at the end. This was very enjoyable. 7/10","

Jessica Rothe's performance is what kept me interested... she nailed her character and was convincing and funny as well.I don't want to give too much away, but the twists towards the end were a nice surprise and earned a few extra points from me.It's classified as a Horror, Mystery, Thriller but it's also a comedy as I found myself laughing a bunch of times.Certainly a must-see entertaining film produced and executed very well, much better than many other films in this genre.It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.","

"Happy Death Day","TheLittleSongbird","2 November 2017","Saw 'Happy Death Day' as somebody who was fascinated by the concept, found the advertising interesting and good enough to warrant a view and who appreciates horror when done well. Seeing it just before Halloween as part of my Halloween celebrations, will admit to not being as bowled over by the film as would have liked but enjoying it a good deal.As surprisingly interesting as the advertising was (and there has been some dreadful advertising this year, a notable recent example being the completely mis-marketed 'Geostorm'), it is also misleading. One would expect a truly frightening film judging from the trailers, but actually 'Happy Death Day' happened to be much more than what was indicated and wasn't what one would call terrifying or sleep-with-the-light-on-for-a-week. The good news is that 'Happy Death Day' actually makes the most of its concept, refreshing having seen films recently that had concepts that they didn't do anywhere near enough with. The not so good news is that as enjoyable as it was it did feel like something was missing.It is easy to see why lots of people will like, and have liked 'Happy Death Day'. It is just as easy to see why it will be, and has been, a let-down for others. My opinion has shades of both, leaning towards the former. 'Happy Death Day' may be somewhat standard (while the concept is a pretty unique one, some of the story elements aren't), superficial (other than the lead character, the characters are developed very flimsily) and some parts don't make as much sense as they could and feel unfinished.Was expecting more from the killer twist reveal, which is not as clever and surprising as one would like and the whole ending felt rather silly and rushed to me (the killer's motive also came over as really trivial for an elaborate set-up). A little slow to begin with too, it's once the concept kicks in when 'Happy Death Day' properly comes to life and maintains that energy for the rest of the film.For all those faults though, 'Happy Death Day' is also refreshingly self-aware, almost very much aware of its standard-ness and superficiality and acknowledges it, and manages to be lots of fun, creepy-suspenseful and surprisingly thought-provoking. Gruesomely funny sums it up very well.'Happy Death Day' is a long way from amateurish visually, the photography is stylish rather than slapdash, the editing has suitably unnerving moments and the lighting is atmospheric. Christopher Landon never lets it get too heavy while not diluting the fun or scares, and the at times haunting and at others times funky soundtrack adds a lot.When it comes to the script, 'Happy Death Day' is full of knowing humour and never removes its tongue from its cheek, instead keeping it firmly intact throughout which proved to come off really well. It also really makes one think. The story execution is not perfect, but it's never dull and has some neat twists and turns that stops it from being predictable and repetitive.Jessica Rothe should become a bigger star after her excellent lead turn here, she has been acting a few years before this but this is the first time where she really held my attention and allowed me to take proper notice of her. Israel Broussard is also very believable and the two have great chemistry together. The acting on the whole is solid but essentially it's all about Rothe and she is one of the main reasons why 'Happy Death Day' is worth a viewing.Overall, a long way from perfect but quite enjoyable. 6/10 Bethany Cox","

"Happy Death Day","moonspinner55","23 October 2017","Jessica Rothe is amusingly pithy and savvy playing a selfish college beauty, a spoiled sorority sister who rules the school until she is stabbed and killed on her way to a surprise birthday party by a masked lunatic. But fate plays this campus cutie an unusual hand once she discovers she's living her birthday over and over again, each time attempting to cheat death but always running into her attacker. Screenwriter Scott Lobdell isn't trying to sneak a slasher variant of ""Groundhog Day"" passed us--he's upfront about the similarities, even exalts in them, while toying with all the possibilities such a scenario can offer. It takes Rothe three tries to fully comprehend what's happening to her; once she formulates a plan (creating a suspect list), Lobdell mixes things up, so that the movie rarely feels repetitive. Our heroine, snarky to start, follows Bill Murray's example and becomes a better person on her twisted journey (reestablishing contact with her father, apologizing to her roommate, even causing her own demise on one occasion to prevent the cute nerd from the boys' dorm from losing his life). Director Christopher B. Landon deserves credit for delivering a modern-day thriller with lots of action but no gore and no nudity. If it isn't quite a family-friendly slasher flick, it certainly is a squirrelly, sassy one, with some big laughs counterbalancing the suspense. Good show! *** from ****","

She learns that she was totally wasted in the previous night and she leaves Carter to meet her snobish Kappa friends. Then she despises Carter that brings her bracelet that was forgotten in his room; ignores the calls of her father that wants to have lunch with her; visits the office of her professor Gregory Butler (Charles Aitken), who is married and is having an affair with her; and despises her roommate Lori Spengler (Ruby Modine) that gives a cupcake to her. During the night, Tree goes to a party at the Sigma house but is murdered by a hooded masked man while crossing a tunnel. Out of the blue, Tree wakes up on her birthday day on the bed of Carter and relives the day, when she tries to find who might be the killer.""Happy Death Day"" is a surprisingly good film, with the combination of horror, romantic comedy, mystery and thriller genres. The most important is the humor and Jessica Rothe´s performance is great in the role of the cynical Tree Gelbman. There are jokes also with ""Groundhog Day"" and teenage slashers and campus movies that work very well. Her list of suspects is hilarious and the dark humor of the alternate ending is a plus of the DVD. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Morte Te Dá Parabéns"" (""The Death Gives Happy Birthday"")Note: On 15 April 2023, I saw this film again.","

Not entirely, but I walked away happy regardless.For those unaware it's Groundhog Day (1993) with murder as we see a girl repeatedly being killed off only to start to day anew. Personally I loved this idea and was curious with where they were going to go with it.The traditional slasher tropes are all present, some great dark humor is in the script and the cast are all on point. Notable especially is our leading lady Jessica Rothe who was excellent though I spent half the movie baffled by just how much she looks like Melissa Benoist.I'm not sure the finale was up to the same quality as the rest of the film and that is perhaps why it's receiving a 7 not an 8. Something about it just felt inferior and saw the movie go out with a bit of a fizzle.Regardless I can see why the film was so successful, congratulations to everyone involved because though I didn't find it as mind blowing as I'd hoped I can't deny that this is a very inventive fun little film.The Good:Jessica RotheCast are all greatFantastic conceptSome great ideasThe Bad:Weak soundtrack for a movie of this ilkFinale was underwhelmingHearing the same dialogue repeatedly can get frustrating","

"Happy Death Day","kevschwaller","7 October 2017","I saw a pre-screening of Happy Death Day and let me tell you, it was one of the most fun theater experiences I've had. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is definitely for the best. If anyone walks into a movie about a sorority girl living the same day over and over and being killed over and over and expects it to be some genre-defying horror perfection, that's on them. However, that doesn't mean this is a bad movie by any means. Jessica Rothe as Tree Gelbman and Israel Broussard as Carter Davis are fantastic as the two leads. They have excellent chemistry and make us root for them. Rothe's character wasn't the typical horror movie sorority girl, either. She was cunning and badass. She made us believe she could actually figure this mess out. If you don't change your mind on who the killer is at least twice throughout the film, you aren't paying attention.There are curveballs thrown left and right, which made my theater gasp and yell numerous times. You think the movie is about to end on at least two different occasions. The script is smart, there's horror, there's comedy, there's drama. Happy Death Day takes you in numerous directions, while also making sure you have fun along the way. This is definitely one of my all-time favorite campy horror flicks out there. It even pokes fun at Groundhog Day, which it very clearly took some inspiration from. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror; again, it doesn't redefine the genre and there are definitely an abundance of clichés. With that, though, there are still a handful of clever moments I certainly was not expecting.","

"Happy Death Day","stevencvgarcia","14 October 2017","I think people going to see this movie are expecting wayyyy to much from a slasher movie. I'm rating it based on what I expected, and I was certainly impressed. This movie wasn't trying to be anything more than another murder movie, but what made me want to see it was the idea of taking Groundhog Day (which it fully admitted to ripping the idea from) and turning it into a slasher film. I was actually surprised it held back on gore and blood. I was fully expecting it to be all the tropes of gross-out killings, but it was instead focused more on character development and the story. I admit the characters are a bit one-dimensional, but again, it's a slasher movie. It's trying to win any academy awards here. In many ways I think it's parodying those one-dimensional characters of college trope characters and the ""last girl"" in horror movies because it goes all-in on establishing the main characters as somebody you're meant to hate at first. The ending genuinely took me in a direction I didn't anticipate, and then it took me back to what I was expecting, but did it in a way that I felt fresh. All in all, I had fun watching this movie, which I think what this movie was meant to be: Fun.","

"Happy Death Day","CANpatbuck3664","14 October 2017","Every negative review for this movie is going to point out that this movie is built around a concept that we've seen before. Our protagonist is forced to live through the same day again and again. Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow (both excellent movies) made this idea popular and for some people, they won't be able to get past the fact that this isn't brand new gimmick. I don't have a problem if movies borrow from other movies, they just need to do it effectively and put a fresh spin on it. Happy Death Day certainly accomplishes that. At the beginning, the journey hits the first couple of familiar notes but when Tree starts to realize what's happening, that's when the movie shifts gears. They aren't afraid to play with Tree's tragic end day after day and the movie functions for whole periods as a straight comedy. Luckily, this movie is really funny when it wants to be. The writers know enough to play with certain genre clichés and there's a surprising amount of tongue-in-cheek humour here. The marketing for this is a little misleading, it makes this movie look like a traditional slasher movie when it really ends up being a mishmash of comedy, mystery and horrorOther than the living the same day plot point, Happy Death Day centres around the mystery of who Tree's killer is. The movie throws a bunch of obvious red herrings at you right off the bat and I was glad they took it a less obvious direction. I don't think they overplay their hand either, there are a couple of hints here and there but I think you'd have to be pretty perceptive to guess the twists and turns that Day's plot takes. If I had one complaint, there was a point where they looked like they were heading towards a very sentimental resolution that could have been corny. Its a case of me wanting that for these characters. They bypass that though and keep going and while I understand the decision, I might have preferred that wrap-up instead.Another turnoff for certain audience members might be Tree's personality as a character. She's a real b!#@% when we first meet her and I'm not exaggerating. The first time she meets her killer, I wasn't feeling sorry for her. But even when she's at her worst, she still has a certain charisma that you want to keep rooting for her. Writing characters that aren't perfect and are selfish that you want to follow is an art that so many horror movies get wrong. I liked how Tree grows (no pun intended) and by the end I really wanted her to find a happy ending somehow.I don't often get to really discover actors and actresses. Most of the movies I watch are pretty mainstream and by the time someone becomes a lead, you've probably heard about them from somewhere. I wasn't familiar with Jessica Rothe at all but she anchored this movie as Tree. This is a stand up and take notice kind of performance, she's multi-faceted in handling both the drama and the comedy in this movie. I hope this movie is just a stepping stone to bigger things for her and I think the last time I walked away from a movie so impressed with an actress I didn't know was Margot Robbie in The Wolf of Wall Street. Israel Broussard is easy to like as Carter, he's easy going enough that his character's relationship with Tree builds up organically. Rachel Matthews is funny as Danielle Bouseman, she's playing a very stereotypical character (stuck up sorority rich girl) but she nails it. Ruby Modine is sweet as Lori and Charles Aitken is appropriately slimy as Gregory Butler,I couldn't believe how charmed I was by this movie. I didn't plan on going to see this, it was a very spur of the moment thing and walking out of the theatre I was blown away. Happy Death Day isn't the best movie I've seen this year but its the biggest movie-going surprise of the year for me. It features a great turn from an up and coming actress, a good mystery, some well placed meta humour and a willingness to play within its central conceit. The marketing for this movie doesn't show how creative and fun it is and I would urge you to give this a shot. We've come off the summer blockbusters and we're still too early for the awards contenders so if you're looking for something to check out, Happy Death Day is an extremely fun hour and a half at the movies. Also, make sure to show up on time, there's a gag pulled with the opening credits that hints at what's to come.","

Plus a bit of Scream , scary movie and a number of other slasher movies . Jessica Roshe was brilliant in the starring role , you believe in her character , her charm was endearing and despite the 10 years between her character and actual age she played the combination of innocent romantic with a touch a modern feisty independent female in control of her own destiny . The only poor point was how the inevitable twist was handled - that could have been slightly better but definitely worth seeing . Pad.A 7/10","

It's not especially scary, but it does have a little suspense here and there. Mainly it's funny, ingenious, and likable.Overall the movie does a decent job of making sense, although twice near the end actions that certainly would have resulted in some trouble don't.

However, she doesn't die and wakes up in the morning of the same day. Theresa quickly realizes that she must uncover her assailant's identity to survive her birthday and therefore break the curse of experiencing her own death over and over again. Along with a male acquaintance she spent the night with, she starts investigating her potential enemies, their motives and alibis. While doing so, Theresa realizes how her own flaws have let to this tragic situation and she attempts to become a better person.Happy Death Day is one of best horror movies in recent memory. Instead of focusing on gore and special effects, the film works with a desperate, gloomy and mysterious atmosphere and a few efficient jump scares. However, the film has much more going for it. It focuses on a stunning character development as a superficial, rude and egocentric teenage girl slowly becomes a profound, joyful and empathetic young woman. This film can be considered a coming-of-age drama and it's one of the best of its kind. As if those elements weren't enough, Happy Death Day also tells us an interesting love story that becomes more and more profound as the film progresses. It also deals with family and friendship issues in a dramatic way. To lighten things up, the movie also includes humorous parts which mostly consist of absurd situation comedy and a few quirky dialogues. However, this movie succeeds where films and franchises like Evil Dead and Scream have failed before: the humorous elements never take away from the sinister moments as Happy Death Day feels perfectly balanced. The movie is genuinely entertaining from start to finish and once it's over, you simply feel like watching this roller coaster ride again and embrace this movie's unique atmosphere. Some critics and viewers have slammed the movie for having a plot that borrows heavily from the concept of Groundhog Day. This is true but Happy Death Day is executed with so much energy and originality that it simply doesn't matter. Even if you are familiar with the concept, this film will still keep you guessing from start to finish. You probably won't see this movie's outcome coming either.In the end, Happy Death Day is among the very best movies of the year and massively exceeded my expectations. If you like clever horror and coming-of-age movies, you can't get around this film. Happy Death Day is best enjoyed around Halloween with your friends.","

"Happy Death Day","savagdog1","13 October 2017","When I saw the trailer for this movie I admit I rolled my eyes and groaned that they were trotting out the circular time gimmick again. It was of course classic in Groundhog Day, but never seemed to click since then. I was dubious, but after seeing it with my own eyes, I can say I had a great time. I'm not sure if Blum House intended it to be funny, but it had a lot of humor in it, enough I would say to qualify it as a dark comedy. The cast was superb and while it didn't offer anything groundbreaking in terms of murders/deaths, I didn't mind because the story was so well connected and it really had me guessing right up until the end. Another litmus test for the quality of this movie is that the audience was rather quiet during the presentation. I've been to enough of these films to know that when you get a young audience seated in the dark and the film is a snooze, they'll start to talk and whisper and just annoy the Hell out of you. This movie managed to hold the attention of the entire audience and in this day and age I must say, that is an achievement in and of itself. I wasn't prepared to enjoy Happy Death Day as much as I did, but even I can admit when I was wrong. It worked from start to finish. I wasn't aware that Scott Lobdell wrote the script, but when I saw his name in the credits, I realized another reason I enjoyed it. I am familiar with his writing in the comic book industry and he is one of the more notable scribes. It's good to see the skills transfer.","

"Happy Death Day","zkonedog","19 June 2018","There are some movies that try to create a sense of realism within them. There are other movies that lean into character/situational cliches to play for comedy or hijinks. Simply put, ""Happy Death Day"" squarely falls into the latter category. As such, your enjoyment of this film will likely come down to how much you can suspend disbelief at the over-the-top characters to dig into a plot that can actually be intriguing.For a basic plot summary, ""Happy Death Day"" focuses on the story of Tree (Jessica Rothe), a college student who wakes up one morning (her birthday, of all days) in the dorm room of Carter (Israel Broussard) after an apparent hook-up. Tree then goes about her ""normal"" routine, only to be stalked that night (on the way to a party) by a mysterious masked figure. When this figure stabs her and death looks certain...she once again wakes up in Carter's room. It is again her birthday, the date is the same, and the day repeats itself almost exactly the same. As such, the rest of the film entails Tree's struggle first to figure out what the heck is happening, and then finding ways to remedy it.In terms of plot, there are indeed some interesting things happening in ""Happy Death Day"". It is very reminiscent of ""Groundhog Day"" (even outright admitting that fact at one point!) and has a number of fake-outs that shake things up and keep it from being too predictable.Unfortunately (at least for viewers like myself), that plot intrigue is really just a front for a film made for teens heading to the multiplex on a Friday or Saturday night. As I mentioned in the opener, most of the characters are so over-the-top as to be cringe-worthy (at least for more ""seasoned"" film fans), an approach that will not phase younger viewers nearly as much. I watched the movie with a sibling 13 years my junior, and she loved it!I know that ""Happy Death Day"" was probably never meant to be anything more than it is, so that's why I won't drop it down under a middling 5/10 stars. At the same time, the trailers for the film are a bit misleading, as they connote a film that looks like a serious thriller with a time-loop component. You just have to know going in that this isn't exactly the case, as ""serious"" is far from the adjective I would use to ever describe the film.","

"Happy Death Day","matthewssilverhammer","20 October 2017","Happy Death Day comes from Blumhouse Productions, the studio made famous for the resurgence of horror in theaters (Get Out, The Purge, Insidious). However, this is the lightest of light thrills. Sure, it would fit in the slasher movie bin, but with its bubble gum aesthetics and goofy comedy, it's really more Freaky Friday than Friday the 13th. And in that sense, it's mildly charmingif not bright enough to be great. For starters, the premise is pretty stupid, and the execution of that premise isn't much better. A brash and awful sorority girl is forced to relive the same birthday over and over, each one ending in her own murder by a masked killer. Imagine Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow, but in the teen-screams genre and with a lot less complexity. In fact, most of its ""originality"" just comes in its blanket theft from other properties and throwing them all together: the youth world of Mean Girls; the comedy of ""Scream Queens""; the protagonist from ""The Good Place""; the scares from The Purge. It's not bad, just familiar, like we're reliving this recognizable movie just as the character relives her day. Once our girl starts trying to solve the whodunit-mystery, things get more assured and fun, as we find it easier to root for her and her insistence on not dying each day ad infinitum. Even though the deaths and scares are wanting, the other elements work, especially the humor and (gasp!) the heart. It's harmless and forgettable October fare, made more for people who hate horror than me. In other words, my wife will love it.","

"Happy Death Day","Leofwine_draca","9 October 2019","HAPPY DEATH DAY is yet another modern-day slasher film, a difficult beast when the genre has been effectively dead in the water ever since SCREAM came out back in 1996. This one adopts a sci-fi twist by basically copying GROUNDHOG DAY left, right and centre, from the lead's reliving of the same day over and over again down to her realisation that she needs to atone for her despicable behaviour. I found that it suffers in two ways: once from the predictability of the premise (and I do love GROUNDHOG DAY) and second from making the lead just too unlikeable. However, it's not all bad. The direction is brisk and efficient and some of the supporting performances are well judged; the humour also tends to work better than the horror, although not always. The double-twist ending doesn't really satisfy, however.","

"Happy Death Day","rockman182","16 October 2017","The trailer for this film accompanied by 50 Cent's ""In Da Club"" looked  incredibly dumb, but that didn't mean that the film wasn't going to be  a stupid good time. These types of repetition of a certain day films  are somewhat popular with recent incarnations being completely  forgettable. Groundhog Day gets it right, and I was curious to see a  college slasher drama try to take a different spin on the idea.  The film is about Tree Gelbman, a typical short fused sorority girl who  loves to party and get drunk and her trials against a day that keeps  repeating. On her birthday she is murdered and the day keeps resetting  until she can figure out who her killer is. The daily death takes a  toll on her body and she gets physically weaker each time. its a tough  task having to try to figure things out when everything around her  resets and the killer and his/her motivations remain unknown.  Jessica Rothe was just perfect for this role. She's an attractive lead  who played the college girl role to a tee. Her character grows by the  end of the film and you start to feel a better connection with her as  she becomes a different human being when her constant death teaches her  about her own life. Other than that, there aren't really many fleshed  out or identifiable characters, which is fine. This is a cheap thriller  and should be treated a such, doesn't mean it isn't entertaining.  The repetition surprisingly doesn't overstay its welcome and keeps  itself fun. This film is barely a horror because its so stupid and the  film knows it. Its more of a comedy with killing than anything else.  Which is perfectly fine. The killer reveal is kind of obvious despite  the writers trying to twist you away from it. Overall, you won't have  much of an impression from this picture but it makes for a good time in  the cinema.  6.5/10","

"Happy Death Day","jtindahouse","16 October 2017","I'm starting to see a trend develop in modern horror movies (the good ones at least) and I really like it. Film makers are beginning to realise that for horror to work there has to be some different levels to the film. 90 minutes of watching people get killed isn't going to be able to cut it anymore. You have to be able to make the audience laugh, think and even move them emotionally. If you can do that then your film will be a success. Earlier this year 'Get Out' pulled it off and now 'Happy Death Day' has nailed it too.When the opening logos featured a joke (literally in the first few seconds of the film) I thought I may have misread the tone of the film in the trailers. Turns out I had, but in a good way. It wasn't an indication that the film was to be a laugh-fest, simply that it had that layer to it. And the thing about the layers that the film possesses it that every one of them works. Whatever it tries to pull off it manages.The twists and turns and how crafty it is about concealing them truly blew me away. At least three times I thought to myself such and such element would be better if they'd done so and so, only to later find out they did indeed have that up their sleeve the whole time. The film is incredibly smart.I can't say enough good things about this film. The trailers won't give a fair indication to people of what this film is truly capable of, and so sadly I fear many who would love it will not get around to seeing it. If you get the chance though please do see it. It's a fantastic film and you won't be disappointed.","

"Happy Death Day","Zac_La_Porte","24 July 2022","This is the excessively fun horror-comedy version of Groundhog Day with a slasher twist. The popular concept where there's the spotlight on the main character who keeps on reliving the same day over and over again has been borrowed and reused so many times, one example being Edge of Tomorrow in 2014. Although that movie received positive criticism, a lot of films that take this concept will fail miserably, but Happy Death Day is not one of them.This killer-mystery horror-comedy features a worthy performance from Jessica Rothe, who the film introduces as a real jerk of a college girl. But if you wait for it, her snotty attitude improves and you begin to root for her as she's continuously being killed and must relive the day until she figures out her killer's identity. This makes for a very interesting idea, and alike Groundhog Day, although a lot of the same actions and lines are repeated throughout the movie, it just never gets boring and it's always fascinating to see the lead discovering that for themselves.Happy Death Day is also probably the best horror-comedy for teens seeking thrills and laughs, with there being an appropriate impact level of horror violence, an admirable amount of jokes and an unexpected plot twist many horror-mysteries are capable of but don't do. And despite this movie having a really light-hearted horror and a reasonably silly tone, it's as the lead's attitude and outlook starts to become nicer that there's a touching message that will possibly leave a lot of viewers thinking about how they can be a better person. It's another example of everything in this movie being a surprise.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"Happy Death Day","ops-52535","7 November 2017","i usually don't write reviews of films that i don't like,but because the of the good ratings almost everywere my wife decided to have a try at this horror movie,with me as a hand-holder in case of gut wrenching moments. I liked the 10 first minutes till the miss found a music box in a tunnel.how exciting i thought,but then the looping started ,same subject over and over till i guess this went on for 7 times or whatever.Then i thought that this must be the end(it definitely should have been)but it lasted even further 15 minutes and 2 more loops into a very disappointing end.looping movies are difficult to make and looping horror movies are a supertight narrow genre to succeed in, and i think this film lacked fantasy and intelligence to wake interrest. this script has no originality at all.take a look back to the 80's and learn.....we shall all praise the headactress's nice appearance and patience on the screen,and also the editing and cinematography of this film,which makes a recovery of the total score at 3 stars","

"Happy Death Day","TdSmth5","14 January 2018","""Tree"" wakes up on her birthday in some guy's dorm. She treats the guys like crap because that's what Hollywood finds acceptable these days. She rushes out, and as she walks across campus several details are emphasized. She goes to her dorm where her roommate has a birthday cupcake for her, which she rejects. She runs to class. Turns out she's the married teacher's mistress. She's got a sorority meeting later. Then a surprise birthday celebration at the sorority house. She complains bitterly because she doesn't want her birthday celebrated. Sure, what college girl doesn't want to celebrate her birthday with her friends? Those in the movies. On her way to a party at night she's stalked by some guy in the university's mascot mask--a baby face. Eventually he kills her. And she wakes up again in the guy's dorm and the day repeats itself. After a couple of these cycles, she starts remembering the previous cycles more and more and realizes that she can't die. She reluctantly befriends the guy with whom she spent the night and he suggests that she actually try and find out who's killing her, since she seems to have an indefinite amount of time. She agrees and tries to avoid people or situations that led to her death previously but to no avail, she always ends up killed anyway. Finally, she has a Nitzschean epiphany and realizes all the wrongs she's done, all the people she's mistreated and in one of the cycles of the eternal recurrence of the same actually changes and decides to become a force for good. She ends up dead anyway. But by accident she discovers the identity of the killer and tries to confront him before he kills her. But then there's a twist.Happy Death Day is yet another sorry PG-13 horror movie with a dislikeable, annoying, and insolent young female lead where horror is reduced to a minimum and sexual references abound. IMBDb tells us that we have to witness 11 times the same day more or less, a completely dull and unremarkable day. This movie could have worked as an R-rated slasher, with plenty of nudity and violence. Instead as a sanitized yet politically correct PG-13 movie with an obnoxious lead character, a weak cast, and a pointless day that repeats itself, this movie has very little going for it. Rachel Matthews shines in the role of the girl running the sorority. Other than that, there's little worth seeing here.","

"Happy Death Day","TxMike","21 April 2018","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. Honestly I probably would not have watched it but when I noticed it had zero hold requests I thought, ""What the heck"" and got it.Much of the college scenes, at least the outdoors parts, were filmed in New Orleans along St Charles Avenue, an area I love. Jessica Rothe plays the part of a stuck-on-herself college student Tree Gelbman. I had not seen her in anything before and she carries the movie very well.The story is a derivative of the story in ""Groundhog Day"" and they even make reference to it, and Bill Murray, in an in-character conversation. But they only borrowed some concepts, most of the story is very original.Basically Tree is stalked and gets killed at night by a person in a clown mask, but immediately after that she re-awakens on the morning of that same day, in a boy's room after a night of drunken partying. She is killed several times, in many different ways, each time starting the day fresh again. Why this day? Maybe because it is her birthday.So Tree reasons, the only way to stop all this is to figure out who the killer is, so that is the running storyline. In the process she realizes the error of her ways and also becomes a changed person. In the end the identity of the killer is a surprise to most of us.We found it to be enjoyable entertainment, and what contributed is the lack of foul language and overt sexual references, so common in so many of today's movies. This one is relatively clean and that makes it much more enjoyable.","

"Happy Death Day","GOWBTW","13 October 2017","Ever experienced Deja vu? For this college student, it's a first. Tree Gelbman(Jessica Rothe) experience it for the first time after a wild night of partying at a university. She wakes up in a dormitory where she meets Carter(Israel Broussard) with questions on how she got here. Eager to get back to her sorority, she encounter the scenes, sounds, and people around her. Today's Tree's birthday, and she's not a happy camper whatsoever. When she goes out to celebrate, she is killed. Only to come back to the dormitory where she crashed. And everything seems to repeat itself. Over and over again. In the second time, she tries to go to a different direction, only to be killed, again. On the third time, she would try to find out who wants her dead. With Carter's help, she would get closer to the killer. In one deja vu, she walked out in her birthday suit causing a lot of dropping jaws. Then she would make restitution for her past behavior. Most of it is when she lost her mother. This movie has a lot of scares along with a lot of laughs. The hospital scene was great. And that kill when she was handcuffed in the police car was amazing. I enjoyed this film very much. It was highly entertaining, and worth my while. A must see. If you like Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day"", then this is for you. Christopher B. Landon did an excellent job on this film. 5 stars","

"Happy Death Day","kannibalcorpsegrinder","19 December 2017","Awakening in the same dorm every morning, a college student finds that she's been reliving the day of her murder and must set out to not only find out why she's going through the same loop every day but also discover the identity of her killer before the process stops occurring.This one ended up being quite the strong and stylish effort. One of the films' finest qualities is the utterly original and impressive storyline at the heart of the film. Even though it can essentially be boiled down into being a horror-based version of another mainstream film, the concept is still unique and creates a lot to really enjoy with this one. The freshness of this type of spin on the typical slasher material makes for quite a fine charge by essentially turning the genre on its side with the final girl being killed every time and keeping the film revolved around that struggle for the duration of it's running time. That leads into the films' most striking point where this one keeps relying on unique and inventive methods to keep doling out the same treatment over and over again in different scenarios and locations for its' horror scenes. After initially encountering the killer in the walkway out on campus to then being taken out during the birthday celebration in the sorority house which has a series of striking visuals with the strobe lighting taking place throughout the scene and then ushering in the series of extremely fun and engaging montage pieces of her going around investigating the different suspects before being attacked which is insanely fun while moving this along nicely. The fact that this one manages to tie it into her trying to stay on top of the repetition and investigations into what's happening creates a nice sense of surprise with how the killer will emerge and take her out as the differences in the day's activities mean that the surprise comes from how it changes around to have them pop up despite all the changes. Once it delves into the need for her to engage in behavioral changes to ensure there's no more repeating of her situation, this creates a strong and impressive emotional resonance for the final act which is a fun brawl around the hospital which end this one on a high note. While these here are what make this one fun, it does have a few minor flaws. This is strictly based on the killers' motivation, which is inherently lame and doesn't make any sense at all. As well, the fact that there's never any mention as to why the repetition keeps occurring at all since this point is completely glossed over and never brought up at all. These minor issues keep this one down slightly.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.","

(1 viewing)
SPOILERS
she must be really dumb because i thought of two simple solutions. if the idea is to make it through the day without dying, just get in your car and drive to another state. they tried to shoe it in at the end, she said she's going as far away as possible right before she figured out her room mate is the killer. the other way is so simple. get a gun or some sort of weapon, wait for the killer to come after you and kill him.i will give it credit for one of the funniest jokes/pranks i've seen. when she wakes up at the end he is dressed in the same clothes and calls her to make her think she's reliving the same day again. priceless. and the twist was kinda decent. goosebumps started a tiny bit, but couldn't get to ownage level.","

"Happy Death Day","BA_Harrison","4 November 2017","If you get a strong sense of déjà vu watching Happy Death Day, that's because it takes the basic premise of Bill Murray classic Groundhog Day and adds a whole heap of familiar slasher clichés. But whilst undeniably derivative, the film still manages to be huge fun. At first one wonders whether it will succeed in offering anything beyond its high-concept mash-up premise, but as things progress it becomes clear that we're in safe hands, writer Scott Lobdell delivering a clever and witty script with director Christopher Landon confidently handling the action so that repetition never seems boring.Replacing Murray's obnoxious weatherman is attractive but self-obsessed sorority bitch Tree (Jessica Rothe) whose birthday brings an unexpected surprise—death!—a psycho in a mask attacking her as she makes her way to a party. To Tree's horror, she is forced to relive the day again and again until she can work out the identity of her murderer and prevent herself from being killed. As in Groundhog Day, Tree is able to change the course of her repeated day with the knowledge she has gleaned, and ultimately becomes a much nicer person in the process. In the Andie MacDowell role is Israel Broussard as nice guy Carter Davis, who tries to help Tree with her terrible predicament.Equal parts wry comedy and PG friendly horror, Happy Death Day isn't about to scare your socks off, but thanks to fine performances from a solid cast, some imaginative plot twists, and a snappy pace, it's still hugely entertaining stuff that should appeal to horror and non-horror fans alike.","

"Happy Death Day","morrison-dylan-fan","25 October 2017","With Halloween coming up, I started taking a look at what Horror movies were being shown on the big screen. Finding Vincenzo Natali's Haunter (2013-also reviewed) (which has the same ""hook"",but a darker tone) to be superb,I was excited to spot a film on the big screen with a similar set- up,which led to me joining in the Death Day.View on the film:Setting the timer,the screenplay by X-Men Comic-Book writer Scott Lobdell spends the opening 15 minutes cheekily ribbing the clichés of the Slasher genre,via Davis being the well-meaning pretty boy,Tree being the popular,mean ""it girl"", and Tree's entire clique being based around showing the nerds who really is too cool for school.Catching Tree in a time loop,Lobdell gives the shiny Slash shocks sharp, underlying psychological terror, as each time she is murdered,leads to Tree getting increasingly raw fears that she will never escape the loop. Along with slicing up over a dozen, weapons- grade ""Final Girl"" battles, Lobdell takes an excellent stab at Horror-Comedy, that shines in each attempt Tree makes to survive the day,from Tree walking round the campus care-free and naked,to the headache Tree gets of having to re-live a deadly morning routine.Perfectly stepping in time with Lobdell, director Christopher Landon & cinematographer Toby Oliver turn the Slasher Knife with an irresistible Pop-Rock atmosphere,of whip-pans around the campus,and neon lights over the killings that creates a party mood.Backed by a jumpy score from Bear McCreary and a great mask designed by ""Ghostface"" creator Tony Gardner, Landon gets into the Slasher groove with ultra-stylised tracking shots following Tree and the psycho,and overlapping slo-mo eyeing the wear and tear Tree experiences in the loop. The only one aware of what is happening, Jessica Rothe gives an excellent performance as Tree,whose sarcastic dry-wit Rothe hits with a real relish,that transforms into a tough, thoughtful confidence,as Tree wishes her killer a happy death day.","

"Happy Death Day","Tweekums","22 September 2020","College girl Tree Gelbman is about to have the worst birthday of her life... repeatedly. She wakes up in the bed of a boy she doesn't know. As her day progresses and she interacts with various people it becomes clear that she isn't a particularly nice person. When night falls she heads to a party and gets murdered by a person in a mask. She isn't dead though; she wakes up once again in the boy's bed, this time she knows his name is Carter. She is about to relive the same say over and over; the way she dies may change but she always ends up being killed. She figures that if she is to make it to the next day she will have to identify the killer before it is too late. In the process she learns some truths about herself.I wasn't expecting too much of this film but ended up pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be a cross between 'Groundhog Day' and a slasher but it was better than that. It is far less gory than I expected and it doesn't dwell on how Tree dies each time. Instead it develops her character nicely as the day of her death repeats. There are moments of tension and some good scares as well as more laughs than I expected. The way she goes about uncovering her killer gives the story a decent mystery which is likely to keep the viewer guessing till the final reveal. Jessica Rothe did a fine job as Tree. Making her character believable despite the impossible situation. The rest of the cast was solid playing the various horror/college comedy stereotypes nicely, often with a slight twist. Overall I'd recommend this to horror fans wanting more humour than gore.","

"Happy Death Day","trnjamesbond","28 October 2017","Happy Death Day is one of the worst horror films of 2017. The cast is highly irritating, and just forgettable. Tree Gelbman yes you read that right, the main character is named Tree, played by Jessica Rothe. Her character is nothing that I even care for, just an ignorant girl from a rich family acting like she is better than anyone around her, her sorority sisters are just as pathetic. So here we sit watching some over privileged character walk through the steps of a ""Groundhog Day"" style film, living her death over and over again, which was portrayed in the trailer. Scott Lobdell was the writer for this terrible film, and in my opinion highly plagiarized from Groundhog Day, except this hack of a writer will not be sued because the story was tweaked enough and he turned it into a horror slasher style film, instead of a comedy. If people want to pay money to see such drivel then by all means, go right ahead. There is no likable character, I wanted them all to die, and there is no point to see this film unless it's something to fall asleep to. That's it folks move along now nothing to see here. 6.7 is a fake rating made by this fake website and fake people. This is a big old zero people. Avoid at all costs.","

She can't remember him or anything that happened the night before but she goes about her day but later that night she is brutally murdered. She then wakes back up in Carter's room and relives the exact day only to die again. This here keeps on happening and she must try and figure out who is killing her.If GROUNDHOG DAY and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE had a baby it would turn out to be something like HAPPY DEATH DAY. It's funny but I've read a lot of reviews that called this movie fresh and original but I personally don't see how those words could be used because this is basically that Bill Murray film except with a killer. With that being said, the film kept me mildly entertained while watching it but the ending left me somewhat cold and confused and the more I thought about the picture the less I liked it.As I said, this here is basically GROUNDHOG DAY all over again but thankfully both Rothe and Broussard were good enough in their role where we cared about them. The film is basically a character driven film where the Tree character is constantly having to change the type of person she is and I thought the actress did a very good job in the part. She certainly made us feel that all of this stuff was happening to her and that it was changing her. I will also give the film credit for keeping you off guard as to who the killer is. The various problems with the film include the fact that it's really never scary and none of the attack scenes contain any tension. I'd also argue that the film falls apart in the final twenty-minutes. I'm not going to spoil anything but the ending just doesn't work at all and especially once you start to think about it and go over the earlier events in your head. It was a nice attempts but it just didn't work.HAPPY DEATH DAY is one of those films that will keep you entertained while you watch it but afterwards it just won't leave that much of an impact.","

"Happy Death Day","thirtyfivestories","16 October 2017","A poisonous sorority has inundated Bayford University with bitter rivals. A calorie cutting agenda cuts the crop of wishful debutantes, while 3 a.m. pledge inductions bloat testosterone and deplete respect. A mire of social cannibalism, the school common reeks of misappropriated ambitions.Tree, a sisterhood loyal, wakes in a pseudo-nerd's dorm room from a painfully obvious and contradicting ring tone. The three letter word illuminating from her screen elicits audible disdain. The seeds of selfishness are planted as she bosses around the servant boy who never deserved to care for her.Karma should never be laughed at, but here it is a tone-deaf joke. Tree has ample opportunities to correct her putrid elitism, but even death needs a few semesters' worth of lectures to make a dent in her obnoxious personality. With protagonist that even the most condescending individual would despise, the narrative throws all stakes in a fiery garbage bin where its victimizing one liners should have rested.When a film's universe is intrinsically tethered to time, it becomes inexcusable to disregard time frames entirely. The viewer becomes punished when they dive into the intricacies of the events that the film subjugates upon the audience repeatedly. No matter how long Tree stalls in waking moments, or how swiftly she jets out of the stranger's door, a timer starts when it is most convenient for the pitiful visual gags to wear themselves out.A heavy handed score mixed with the most ""paper due at midnight"" twist push this narrative into new depths of apathetic storytelling. Avoid this film if you have a weak neck, because you are bound to shake your head every two minutes. No laughs are intentional, and this meme nursery only succeeds in being needlessly offensive.","

It is considered a slasher horror film but can also be somewhat described as a sci-fi romantic comedy in a sense.The cast is great as this may be a star turning into performance for lead Jessica Rothe. At the beginning we can see as she may be somewhat unlikable but as the film progresses, she develops into a strong character in which we root for.Filled with several clever twist and overall a film better than it should have been. The sequel is coming out next year in 2019 and perhaps if is a bigger success, we may see a third. Overall Happy Death Day is a great ride from start to finish and well done.","

"Happy Death Day","mhorg2018","24 October 2018","While this isn't all that original, it was entertaining and fun, and did have some interesting plot twists. The lead, Tree goes from being totally unlikable, where I was glad she was getting killed - to being very likable and I was glad to see her change. The violence is a bit toned down and it isn't gory, but that's not a bad thing since the story carries it rather than depending on gruesome scenes to keep one interested. I went in with low expectations but when the movie ended I was glad I watched it.","

"Happy Death Day","juneebuggy","1 November 2019","Set up like Groundhog day with a college student trapped in a 1 day time loop that forces her to relive her birthday, over and over again which ends with her murder at the hands of a masked madman. She tries to figure out who the masked man is, narrowing down the pool of suspects on the campus as she tries to solve her own murder.This was a decent enough slasher film. I enjoyed watching the b1tchy mean girl change as the days and her repeated murders went by. She actually seemed to get prettier the nicer she got. A twist at the end. I was never sure whodunit, lots of suspects.","

"Happy Death Day","brankovranjkovic","4 November 2017","Comedy, horror drama. The heroine played by Jessica Rothe is murdered at the end of her birthday! The murderer is disguised by a 'baby face' mask, and she immediately wakes up at the beginning of the same day, over and over and over again. She now knows what will happen during the course of the repeating day and we then see her murdered again, each time in a different manner. Every time she wakes we see that she has suffered some injury relevant to the murder, and these accumulate over the passing days. Her urgent need is to slowly piece together the evidence in the course of each repeating day until she can determine who the killer is. Every morning her frustration grows but at least she slowly progresses towards knowing who the killer is. Every morning we see her realise that reliving the same day gives her the opportunity to slowly learn how to be a better person. Comparison with 'Ground Hog Day' and 'Edge of Tomorrow' are inevitable – GHD is even referenced at the end during a brief conversation. Jessica Rothe's performance is the only thing stopping this feeling like a very low budget made for T.V. movie.","

"Happy Death Day","swilliky","18 October 2017","Taking a popular trope and splashing it onto a teenage thrasher doesn't do much for this dull horror release. The strangely named Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) is a shallow sorority girl who goes through her day selfishly blowing off others and insulting everyone she knows until she is murdered. She wakes up to find that she is repeating the same day over again but this takes a little longer than it should, especially since they advertised this film a lot and audiences are here for the conceit. She's murdered again and freaks out as she wakes up in the same position. No matter what she tries, she keeps getting murdered by a mysterious figure who wears the baby mascot mask. The murders are not very clever but the killer is very determined to take out Tree.Tree keeps waking up in the dorm room of Carter (Israel Broussard), a guy she drunkenly went home with last night though he did not have sex with her. As she goes through repeated trauma, he turns from a total strange into a trusted ally that she asks for advice. He is skeptical each time the day resets but entertains the scenario and gives her advice of using her many lives to investigate who wants to kill her. She investigates the people who might hate her like the sorority leader Danielle (Rachel Matthews) but she rules them out right before she gets murder. The inevitable montage of repeated death plays out as she reduces the suspects. She was having an affair with her doctor professor Gregory Butler (Charles Atiken) but eliminates his wife Stephanie (Laura Clifton) as her murderer.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com","

"Happy Death Day","Hey_Sweden","1 March 2019","Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) is a stuck-up, self-absorbed sorority girl who's having one Hell of a very bad birthday - over and over and over again. It always ends with her being slaughtered by a masked maniac. Frustrated beyond belief, she tries various means of breaking the cycle, sometimes with the help of a nice-guy frat boy named Carter (Israel Broussard).""Happy Death Day"" is a reasonably clever attempt to blend the ""Groundhog Day"" premise with a conventional modern slasher; it's no great shakes, but it held this viewers' attention thanks to tip-top pacing and a genuinely high excitement level. Plus, part of the whole point of the story (concocted by Scott Lobdell) is the Tree character arc: she starts out as pretty unlikeable, and soon starts regaining her humanity, eventually realizing that each day presents more opportunities for her to be a better person (the films' main message).Given that the rating is PG-13, some viewers will be let down by a lack of nudity and excessive gore, but the film doesn't really need these elements to work. It benefits from a very capable performance by sexy lead Rothe, who becomes completely irresistible when she channels her inner badass and attempts to take the fight to the person whom she believes to be her nemesis.The performances by the largely no-name cast are engaging: Ruby Modine as Lori, the roommate, Charles Aitken as the married professor / lover, Rachel Matthews as the snooty Danielle, Rob Mello as a criminal named Tombs, etc.All in all, a respectable effort, well directed by Christopher Landon (the son of Michael Landon), that has already spawned one sequel (with a number of the same characters / cast returning).Still, this viewer felt that actually name-checking ""Groundhog Day"" at the end really wasn't necessary; most of us get the joke.Seven out of 10.","

"Happy Death Day","aloysius_predato","11 October 2017","The first thing you need to do is ignore any positive review of this film. There is no doubt in my mind that most if not all of these were written by persons connected with the film in some way. This movie is utterly AWFUL! Now, I cannot deny that Christopher Landon and Scott Lobdell are meekly innovative in unraveling this tale, but this is not enough to save the film. Sure, Happy Death Day will be able to score numerous jumps on people who don't watch horror movies for a living, but how hard is that. Sorry, I'm not trying to be condescending to anyone. I pride myself on my stolid nature, and I have little in the way of a life. I assume that you do, and it is my hope in writing this that I may prevent your wasting time and money in the name of Happy Death Day. You see, I'm much like many of you. I slave day in and day out beneath the yoke of mundane tasks simply so that I can continue to do so. When the week ends, I need the escape that the cinema often provides. When the escape is inadequate, I take it personally. In the case of Happy Death Day, I found myself wanting to escape the very showing of the film itself. Sure, I could have left, counted my loss and been a better man for it, but I persisted. Why? I did it for you. In theory, I wasted my time so you will not. Please, do not render my sacrifice vain. If you must see something, theaters usually boast many options. I guarantee that Happy Death Day is the worst option that exists at the present time, at least in my town. Happy Death Day is peppered with characters that do naught but remind me of people I hated in college, or, at least, ½ dimensional cardboard cutouts of those people. Jessica Rothe's protagonist, Tree, is thoroughly unlikeable from beginning to end, even after she undergoes her Hallmark-esque epiphany. I hope I didn't spoil the obvious. In any case, Rothe's performance is utterly forgettable, and, in my opinion, Landon could probably have replaced her with any mildly attractive barista in the region and achieved the same result if not better. Not only did I want to strangle Tree every time she opened her mouth, but I also wanted to strangle myself for buying the seat. Perhaps you wonder why I did not go into specifics. There really are no specifics, it's just bad, there was nothing good. It's a roller coaster ride, but not a good one; it was like one of those traveling midway coasters that give you whiplash and have you fearing for your life. I was waiting for Scooby, Shaggy and the gang to pull up in the Mystery Machine and help Tree discover who's killing her. THAT would have made for a better film. Plus, if you are intent on seeing it, who am I to spoil it. Lastly, when did a female's bare upper back begin to qualify as partial nudity? Did I miss something? I guess, technically, they're not lying, bare skin is nude skin, but, for those of you who might have been hoping for something more pulse inducing, there's nothing for you on this front either.","

"Happy Death Day","movieman6-413-929510","13 February 2019","Happy Death Day is a new horror mystery film directed by Christopher Landon, the director of Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones and Scout Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse.
The film is about the student Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe). When she wakes up on her birthday in the bed of her fellow student Carter Davis (Israel Broussard) she tries to get through her day in her normal student way, but when she is followed in the evening and killed by someone with a baby mask, she revives she's her day again.
When the same thing happens again the next day, she learns that she is stuck in a timepiece and she is doomed to repeat this day until she can expose her killer and learn how to prevent her death.
This horror film is soon made by using a timepiece as a movie like Groundhog Day, but then in a horror jacket. Films with a time magnifier can be fun, but this is the third movie this year that uses a time magnifier in the story, after Before I fall and 2:22. If you've already seen one or both of these films this year, the use of another time magnifier in another movie can happen repeatedly. Luckily they know how to keep this film interesting for the public by using a masked killer. This way you as a viewer can try to guess who the perpetrator is. It is unfortunate that the perpetrator can easily be identified if you keep paying attention during the film. This way you can be ahead of the film and lose interest when they are behind the wrong suspect. If in the end the reason of the killer is made known, this reason can also be disappointing. The reason may seem somewhat faint and weak for some.
The film also becomes more comical rather than scary at one point. For example, the film for people who go to the cinema for a horror movie may be a bit disappointing. Furthermore, the film is more fun for a young teenagers of just over sixteen, because for older viewers the film in terms of horror a bit disappointing, because in the end it is more fun to laugh than the movie is really scary.
The cast of the film does consist of a group of beginning actors. Fortunately, most of them know how to communicate credibly that they are in a time-saver by repeating certain scenes in a credible way. Jessica Rothe does a good job as the lead actress in the film. It's nice to see how she adjusts her character during the film, to find out more about the identity of the killer.","

"Happy Death Day","PyroSikTh","18 August 2020","I did not like Groundhog Day. I know, sacrilegious of me as a movie fan. I found it overlong and after a while the timeloop concept got boring. In fact I tend to dislike time-loop concepts as a rule of thumb. Doesn't matter if it's a movie, a TV show, or a single episode, they all just mould into the same story in different skin. But every now and then someone comes up with a new idea to shake it up. I was quite keen for Palm Springs, but whoever owns Hulu these days decided not to release it internationally. So while I'm left here twiddling my thumbs wondering whether that'll ever leave the American continent, I instead decided to watch another time loop movie that's been sitting on the watchlist for a while, with the interesting twist of being a slasher flick!Happy Death Day follows Tree on her birthday as she wakes up in a stranger's dorm room, hungover, avoids her father's calls, and is murdered on her way to a surprise party by a killer in a baby mask. Time loop time! She wakes up back in that dorm room with her hangover. Happy Death Day goes through all the same tropes as every other time loop movie, including the initial confusion, the realisation of what's going on, a montage of her enjoying her consequence-free freedom, having to explain to friends her situation over and over again because they keep forgetting, and desperately trying to avoid her fate by leaving or trying to outsmart the killer. Of course eventually she's persuaded into trying to discover who her killer is thinking this will set her free from her time loop, and that takes up the majority of the movie's runtime.Tree is like every time loop protagonist at the beginning of their stories; selfish, narcissistic, and a complete a**hole. But, as with every time loop story, she becomes aware of her actions and how horrible a person she really is, and becomes better and more caring by the end. Thankfully Jessica Rothe is so effortlessly charming and lovable that it becomes very quick for us to become endeared by Tree. We never particularly see her progression from b*tch so genuinely nice person, but we do see a whole new side to her open up as the loops go on, and it's at least clear from the offset that she is nowhere near the biggest b*tch of the movie. This all makes her final confrontations with everyone in her lives; the sincere apologies, the petty revenges, the genuine care for her friends, all the more impactful. While the scene with her opening up and apologising to her father wasn't going to win anyone any awards, it was hard not to moved by it even just a little bit. And she's no damsel in distress either, taking matters into her owns hands and showing smarts and competence as well. Token horror female bimbo she is not.As previously hinted at, Jessica Rothe is a revelation. She didn't particularly blow me away on the grand stage of acting, and she maybe lacked a little subtlety in her emotions, but she managed to carry the movie effortlessly, and was a far cry from the soap opera quality of acting I was sort of expecting. She has buckets of charm that made it really easy to root for Tree, and important quality for a protagonist, and her emotional range, while not subtle, was definitely worthy of praise. Just the stark differences in her smiles spoke volumes not only of her performance here, but also of how far she's capable of going if given the right opportunities. While her fake smile, her genuine happy smile, and her smile through tears are all functionally the same, each of them were instantly recognisable as to their intent. Almost every one was infectious.Something else that really surprised me about this movie was how downright entertaining it was. Sure, it was maybe a little light on the horror without any kind of gore at all, and the scariest moments were all the most cliche horror can get, but the amount of humour in this movie caught me off guard. This is definitely more of a horror comedy than just a time loop horror movie. And again, a lot of that comes down to Rothe, her expressions, and her quippy improvisations.It's not a work of art, nor does it particularly break any new ground. While being a time loop slasher flick is new, it falls into the exact same pitfalls as both genres at once. The murderer often appears out of nowhere without plausible explanation, and there are so many leaps in logic they're not even worth counting (in all her loops, not once does it occur to her to try and take her murderer's mask off). But this isn't a movie that wants you to think too much. It wants you to switch off and get taken for a ride. There's twists and turns that only work if you don't spend the whole movie actually chasing the answer.I had a fun time watching Happy Death Day and I'm definitely intrigued in watching the sequel, especially considering it follows the same cast of characters. I'm sure it can be enjoyed picking every little detail apart and pointing out every inconsistency (something I definitely did every now and then while watching), but it's just meant to be a good, fun time at the movies. And at that it absolutely succeeds. Tension, laughter, surprises, and maybe a little bit of a tug on your heartstrings, driven by an obviously talented actress carrying the whole movie on her shoulders as if it was nothing. I give Happy Death Day an enjoyable 7/10.","

"Happy Death Day","andyajoflaherty","25 September 2022","What happens if you cross Scream with Groundhog Day? Happy Death Day follows pretty obnoxious and unlikable college student Tree as she sleeps around, treats people like garbage and skips class.... and is then murdered on her way to a party. She then wakes up again that same morning to live that day again, and again, and again, but no matter what she does or where she goes the killer finds her and kills her in a multitude of different ways. Tree has to work out who is killing her, why... and how many times she can keep coming back.I really liked this film. Despite being a mashup of tried and tested ideas it somehow has put them together in a way that feels fresh and interesting. Tree, although starting as a horrible person goes through the predictable arc of becoming a better person, but that aside you never know what's going to happen next, which is quite impressive considering it's infinite loop plot. It's tense, exciting, funny, creepy and unpredictable... and despite the reveal not quite matching the quality of the rest of the film, it still manages to be one of the best horror films I have ever seen. If you are a fan of horror, this is utterly essential viewing...","

"Happy Death Day","Prismark10","15 July 2018","To be fair to Happy Death Day. It does acknowledge its debt to Groundhog Day however the concept of the film is not without its problems and it does run out of steam part way through. The film realises this by coming up with a splinter plot and a twist by which times it gets rather convoluted.The film begins with Tree (Jessica Rothe) waking up in the dormitory room of nice and plai student Carter (Israel Broussard.) Tree does not know him and she only met him the night before which involved drinking and presumably some sex. Tree does not remember much about what happened the night before and Tree quickly rushes out of his room.It is her birthday, there is a surprise party planned by her sorority, she is having an affair with a married lecturer and she is murdered by a masked man later that night only to wake up again in Carter's room.The scenario keeps repeating itself so Tree needs to figure out who is trying to kill her but she also resolves to become a better person rather than be one of the selfish means girls she hangs about with.As she tries to unmask the killer there is an escaped serial killer subplot. Tree misses many opportunities to just run the masked killer over. In fact Tree would had been better off to go get a Magnum 45 and blow the killer's head clean off when they showed up. It would had been a short movie though.The film does try to be smart with its plot. It is a nice mixture of horror, thriller and comedy but it just runs out of gas. Each time Tree wakes up and leaves the dormitory the same events take place outside even if she rushes out of Carter's room or stays in to talk with him. That certainly is timey-wimey gone wrong.","

"Happy Death Day","batmanjokercatwoman","21 October 2017","The character of Tree starts off as this unlikeable character that represents the selfish but pretty blond girl whom you expect to be killed in slasher films. Which is exactly what happens to her, the only difference is she doesn't stay dead and when the day loops backs she's only one to remember the event. This sends Tree on a journey of highs and lows, at first she's in denial, then she's traumatised and then she starts to enjoy it. As she begins a murder mystery to hunt down who's going to kill her. Until all her previous deaths begin to take a toll on her physically and mentally, she realises she can't keep looping too many times. Through this we see her grow as a character and become the heroine we all route for.Newcomer Jessica Rothe delivers a great performance, with some great comedic timings as well as some really emotional moments. She also makes Tree's arc believable making it feel natural rather than forced, letting us follow her on her journey while buying into her complexities as a human-being before we get into her backstory. It follows the Groundhog Day formula well, with a few differences such each death having repercussions on her next loop, as well as a very clever twist as to when the loop will finally end. Each repeated day is well done, never feels too repetitive and each time she wakes up represented differently depending on her state of mind with different camera shots and sounds. The film also has the advantage of being a comedy/horror as it never takes itself too seriously and is always self-aware. Like the Scream franchise it's a slasher with a murder mystery plot as well as a satire on horror, along with that it fits well with other recent self- aware comedy/horrors like Cabin In The Woods, Tucker And Dale Vs Evil and The Final Girls.","

Most of the movie felt like American Pie having the naked scenes replaced with some serial killer slaying again and again the same person without any obvious reason(or any reason whatsoever as I realized in the end).Anyway, the actors were not memorable. Their acting skills were okay. I guess they would seem as something more to a teenager and this is why I am amazed by the number of good reviews this film got. The plot moves along in a totally predictable manner. We see repeatedly the same day of a rich sorority girl waking up in the room of some guy who was kind enough to pick up her pieces after she got wasted the night before. Then she goes on her day and gets killed in slightly different manner every night. Then wakes up at the guys dorm again and everything starts happening again until she finally realizes that she is trapped in a triangle-like situation. The theme is one we know all too well,so nothing much to expect there(so much for the thriller and mystery). The protagonist tries to explore some ways of solving the ""mystery"" but drops them all really fast so we see pretty much more of the same with tiny variations,while she tries to act all scared and panicked. Each morning finds her more screamy than the one before and the in- the-mean-time- reactions make things a bit funny or cringy. Certainly not scary or thrilling.The main problem with this movie is that it tries to pass itself as some horror,mystery film while it's a comedy- crime/light mystery, if it has to be called something. It's a total joke of a horror movie. And it would be amusing if it was advertised as such. You cringe,you laugh but you certainly don't feel any threat at any point. And that's understandable since you have little time to learn anything about any of the characters. What do we know? She dates and sleeps around,not surprising for a sorority girl. She gets scared when they try to kill her, but that's a normal reaction for any human being. After reliving the same thing over and over she decides to stop repeating her actions and explore other possibilities, so nothing really interesting here either.In the end we had a movie with much more laughter than the amount justified for a horror film,no plot,not a deep mystery,in contrast to what we expected and no interesting characters. But we still managed to have some fun with this thrash dialogue film. Not really worth seeing.","

"Happy Death Day","vengeance20","20 October 2017","Seen a trailer for this one while going to a screen of 47 Meters Down! At first, the trailer looked like a stupid comedy film, but as soon as the horror elements started & the Blum House production came up with from the makers that brought you The Purge, Paranormal Activity, etc! Etc! I sat up immediately & paid attention! Usually when you see the Blum House logo & the films they've made, you know these films are usually pretty ace! This was one of those films which you never saw coming, like I looked up a list of upcoming horror films for this year (Horror Buff Alert!) & never even saw this one on that list! It was also around the time where I thought, oh well I've seen all the horrors for this year & then... BAM! This one appears! Ace!So the film utilises the sparingly used Groundhog Day formula for the concept of this Horror film which follows a young sorority girl, Teresa, who is rude, selfish & a complete arse to everyone she comes into contact with. On the day of her birthday, an unknown killer murders her, resting the day all over again! It then occurs to her that everything she notices happened before & it's then when it happens a second & third time, she realises someone is out to kill her, but she has an unlimited supply of lives to try & find out who her killer is & why this person wants to kill her!The story-line was pretty good! I knew what the set-up was going to be like when watching the trailer, but had yet to see the full length things to see exactly what happens through-out the film when & where & how she discovers the killers true identity! The kills in the film were average, not amazing. But they were average! I felt this film lacked in the gore factor quite a bit. It could've been more on the bloody side of things in order for it to be more slasher like! In fact, I'd say this would've been more a mystery & thriller film alone, had it not been for the mask & other horrors elements!The ending I never saw coming! One reviewer said it was obvious, yeah right! It was so un-obvious! I never seen it coming & found it to be quite a surprise although the part before it had me questioning if that was it! You'll know what I mean when you go watch it...!The overall film as a whole was pretty epic & I did enjoy it! It reminded me of Scream in a lot of places! Though it lacked the blood, it was still a pretty solid horror film with some great themes going on! Not to mention the Groundhog Day formula with a horror theme laced into it! It was perfect!Overall, a solid Horror Film! 8/10","

"Happy Death Day","backslapjones","13 November 2018","You can have jokes in a horror movie, you can have scary scenes in a comedy, romance in a horror or comedy, sci fi in a romance or horror or comedy, coming of age in any of them, etc. What you cannot have is this incoherent mess that tries to cram romance, comedy, coming of age, horror, sci fi, action, some half-assed themes of being yourself and learning to be better through second chances, sprinkled with social commentary about our sexist country. I would have given this movie a 5 if it was just another generic brainless slasher film that I got dragged into seeing, but I rated it lower because I had to. This movie tried so hard to be clever, funny, edgy, and all the things that a horror movie really shouldn't be unless it's making fun of other horror movies (Cabin in the Woods). I just don't see the point of this movie at all. Did the divine spirits that granted Bill Murray the gift of resurrection decide this college girl deserves the same? It just all seems so infatuated with whatever it thinks it is, but really it's just a mess.","

So I didn't hesitate to watch this, plus it's a mystery/horror so it makes things more interesting.The plot is about Tree, a sorority girl who relives the same day over and over again after getting murdered each repeat, and in order to stop the loop, she must unmask her murderer.I really didn't see the twist coming, I mean I never really suspected the killer. While it has some overused elements seen in many horror films, this one is good enough. Really good. Exceeded my expectations.","

"Happy Death Day","MickandRorty","14 October 2017","To me, the movie does not work. In the theatrical trailer, you see every one of her ""deaths"". And, since it is a PG13, what you see in the trailer is about as much detail as they show in the movie.Really not much point to this film other than trying to play the whodunnit game. Obviously, once revealed, your mind immediately addresses all of the problems with this resolution. Not for me. Didn't work. Trailer revealing everything did not help the experience either.And before you think, ""Why does he even watch the trailer if he doesn't want it spoiled?"" I am a firm believer that a good trailer is one that does not reveal every single surprise.","

I mean, being murdered every day, only to wake up and try to find who is killing you?? Totally insane, and completely delightful at the same time. It's a nice 'who-did-it' type of horror flick, which I love!!RECOMMENDATION: 9/10 stars!! Stop whatever you are doing right now, and go watch this movie. It's scary, mysterious, and a bit of fun mixed all into one. You'll love it!!","

"Happy Death Day","mm-39","13 November 2017","The surprise of the year, well so far. Once in a while, there comes a movie which will be painfully awful or brilliantly excellent! Happy Death day is brilliant in a 80's campy horror movies way! A fresh movie premise of a female college student who is murdered and must relive the same day over and over again until she solves the murder. Problem is the protagonist aka Tree Gelbman is evil; the list of enemies is way too many! What makes Happy Death day way too cool is the details. The college life and characters are so accurate. There is the snotty female rival, the activist, the nice guy etc that everyone knew in college. I love the sarcasm of the snotty sorority gal. The movie is so so un- P C which creates a guilty pleasure. There are a few cool slasher horror movie moments which pay homage to Friday 13th and Scream. Then there are a few plot devices which keeps the audience guessing. A few scenes which throws the audience into a loop, and then Happy Death Day has a horror plot twist game changer which is just classic aka memorable. 9 out of 10 stars.","

"Happy Death Day","subxerogravity","17 October 2017","It's unique cause it feels like a Slasher film, but the slasher has only one victim. Her name is Tree, she's not the nicest chick at college and kinda deserves getting hit with a blunt object until her skull splits into two. So when it happens, you're like ""good"". Only problem is a freak electrical problem seem to give her the ability to relive her birthday over and over again, which means getting killed over and over again until she can figure out who hates her that much to do something violent about it.It's a good movie simply for the fact that it's a bad one. The very fact that they point out that the film is the exact same plot as Groundhog Day (and the Netflix movie Naked with Marlon Wayans and the Tom Cruse movie Edge of Tomorrow which really reminds me of this flick), gives it the good excuse to be campy. Happy Death Day goes for the complete fun factor, completely focus on the homage to horror films rather just being one.Overall, it's entertaining. I recommend.","

"Happy Death Day","peterp-450-298716","9 February 2018","""I'm totally having deja vu right now.
Oh, I have it all the time.
It's supposed to mean like someone's thinking about you while they're masturbating.
I have it at least five times a day.""You can't really say ""Happy death day"" is original. You'll immediately think of films as ""Groundhog day"" and recently ""Before I fall"" when watching this time loop/slasher movie. The same principle with one crucial difference. The person trapped in an apparently infinite time loop is being murdered each time by an unknown person wearing an idiotic mask. Are you expecting a humorous ""Friday the 13th"" flick? You'll be pretty disappointed at the end of the film. It's never as exciting as the infamous slasherfilms from the 80's. And you can't call it funny either. Besides the clumsy attempt at the end when a link is made with Bill Murray and the mother of all ""time loop"" films. Unfortunately my final conclusion was already made. I'm still wondering what the fuzz was all about.""Happy death day"" was kind of a success in the US. Probably because of the release date (on Friday the 13th) and the overall design. A university campus with Tree (Jessica Rothe) as the central figure, who wakes up every morning in the room of Carter (Israel Broussard) after she got brutally killed the night before. I'm assuming she's sort of a ""Miss Popularity"" based on her arrogant attitude. Time and again she experiences the same daily routine. First awaking bewildered. Then returning to the dorm in a daze. Absently attending class. Paying a surprise visit to the attractive teacher (you never guess why). Going to a party that same evening. And subsequently, to round of the day, she's being successfully murdered. A simple storyline which is easy to follow and gradually turns into a kind of whodunit story.So, this movie is suitable for pubescent teenage girls who are balancing between childish teen films and the more serious stuff. ""Happy death day"" provides a short-lived relaxation without too many creepy elements, so that members of this age group aren't overwhelmed by outright fear. On the other hand, there's a bit of that sugary and airy mood, teen girls can identify themselves with. Tree is such a girl figure others might look up to and who they would love to have as best friend. A fairly snobbish type with also a rebellious side. Her walking around naked is a shining example of that. And last but not least, one can safely eat a maxi-pack of popcorn or a full load of nachos during this film, because you won't see really nauseating or bloody scenes. Pros enough to lure a complete teen audience into the cinema.The funniest (and most predictable) part of this film is of course the moment when the victim can predict future incidents as a true Nostradamus. The one who's witnessing this, stares at it in slack-Jawed amazement. The makers succeeded in giving it an original twist. After every rebirth, Tree suffers more and more from sustained injuries. But apart from that, this is just a mediocre film. A kind of a Columbus case which needs to be solved after several time loops. It was not easy to point out the ultimate perpetrator. To be honest, I thought that was rather far-fetched. Really a film to watch with a few friends on a Halloween night. No more, no less.","

It's like Groundhog Day, Back to the Future, and Scream all rolled into one. I've watched it about three times in the past week to get ready for the sequel. I'm very captivated by Tree's situation and seeing her evolve from snobby sorority girl, to trying to be a better person through her ordeal.Jessica Rothe stars as Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman. After a night of drinking and partying, she wakes up in Carter's dorm room on the morning of her Birthday. She quickly ditches him and goes on with her day. That night, she is stalked and killed by a stranger in a baby mask (Babyface)She wakes back up in Carter's room, only to realize it's the exact same day again. She experiences deja vu. That night, she is stalked and killed again by Babyface.She wakes back up in Carter's room again (You get the picture) She and Carter make a plan to find the killer and break the loop so she doesn't have to repeat the same day over and over and keep dying every single time. Who is trying to kill Tree Gelbman and why? If you love mystery, horror, comedy, and time loops, I highly recommend HAPPY DEATH DAY!!!","

"Happy Death Day","2001ASOfan","11 November 2017","Imagine choosing a film at the multiplex just because you couldn't find anything else worth seeing that day at that particular theater, crossing your fingers you hadn't just wasted your money on a ticket simply because some early reviews had said this was a surprisingly good film, and then enjoying the heck out of the film you happened to take that risk on-- that's what happened with ""Happy Death Day,"" mostly due to Jessica Rothe's performance. She will undoubtedly get plenty of work after this star-making moment in her filmography. Her performance happily reminds me there are tons of hungry actors out there--just give them a chance to shine, in any genre, and they will. Here's why I ended up giving it ten out of ten stars: I love comedies, and have been struggling to find good ones to support in the multiplexes lately. When this turned out to be one of the funniest films I'd seen in ages, one that had me laughing out loud often, especially when I was expecting a mostly horror- oriented film, I have to give it high praise. Comedy is tough, and this film succeeds completely in balancing the horror and comedy elements. Just one example: there is a roughly ten-minute scene near the climax that had me laughing out loud continuously, and I couldn't be more grateful. A warning about the trailer for the film I had seen prior to the film's opening--it was so awful, making the film look so much like a quick, unimaginative money-grab for the horror genre crowd, that I almost skipped the film based solely on the trailer. Thankfully, I didn't, and what an exhilarating joy this turned out to be! One of the best surprises of 2017.","

Lighthearted and enjoyable stabbing movie with ironical touches, it takes a fun premise about everyday from now on really the same and manages to carry it perfectly through to the end . A charming terror/comedy/thriller with a lot of violence, gore and guts , but all this is inevitably well , repetitive and plenty of some good laughs . It is a twisted déjà vu of a reality that repeats itself again and again, until her brutal murder at night by a masked madman . Cast is pretty good .

However, in this case, she relives her death repeatedly at the hands of a slasher before waking up in some nerd's room.What I enjoyed is that each day is slightly different, and as she figures out what's going on, she attempts to change the outcome and eliminate her murderer.I think the finale was a bit dodgy, but on the whole, a slasher movie with no swearing, nudity, sex or gore - how refreshing!","

"Happy Death Day","rgkarim","12 October 2017","Halloween weekends are certainly a bag of tricks and treats themselves. A variety of genres try to compete for the number one spot on the box office, and horror movies continue to try to prove their worth. My weekend reviews start with another film in the slasher collection that looks interesting to say the least. Like all horror films, the truth behind the vague trailers can take a number of forms and levels of quality, so I wasn't sure what I would get on this viewing. What is the verdict? As always read on to find out!LIKES:Surprisingly Deep Character: Most slasher films fail in terms of a gripping character to follow the journey with, in order to provide fodder for our demented killer. Surprisingly, Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) has depth hidden within her superficial looks and sorority attitude. Seeing her character evolve over the film changed my attitudes towards her, especially as her sorrows began to emerge onto the field. And even more impressive is how balanced her multiple aspects were balanced into the story, to maintain the development that was so nicely done. Censored: There are those slasher movies that go over the top to maximize the vomit inducing kills and dismemberments. Happy Death Day, fortunately, is not one of those movies. For a movie about repeating the same day over with a ""deadly"" conclusion, it keeps things rather clean and to the point, avoiding the mind scarring scenes that will be famous on YouTube. The PG-13 rating should assure you that this is a rather mild horror and won't leave you sleepless like some other films can. The Mystery: If you have seen the trailers, you have probably been allured/intrigued as to who is behind that freaky baby like mask. That aspect carries on into the film as you try to piece the puzzle together and solve the Scooby Doo like case. It was the adventure of seeking those answers that kept me invested in the movie, searching for any slight hint to give away the surprise. Keep your eyes open, your minds active, and your thoughts running and you'll get it within 25 minutes, but otherwise enjoy the ride the director created. It's fun: Movies that involve repeating the same day over and over again gets stale fast, because of cheap editing tricks to make the scene seem fresh. Fortunately, Death Day keeps things fun and fairly fresh in the 1.5 hour run time. This movie has plenty of chuckles thrown into the mix, many poking fun at the horror movie genre. Tree's dialogue itself has that aggressive, sorority girl element to it, filled with passive-aggressive compliments and sarcasm that are well-timed. Throw in some well-developed secondary comedy from secondary characters, and the fun just keeps on rolling with each passing day. DISLIKES:Not Scary: My friend and I both agreed that this movie lacked any real bite in terms of the scare factor. Oh sure, a creepy, knife wielding, baby face mascot wearing killer would have anyone afraid to walk a dark corridor in the real world. With the silver screen barrier though, the movie's horror element doesn't do much to build suspense or make you shrivel in your seats. Aside from a few jump scare moments, the comedy aspect of the movie will take over more than the scare component. Sorry you fear feeding fans, no dice on this one. Little Over the Top: Ridiculous factors are all in good fun when they are timed well and not overdone. Happy Death Day sometimes lost its regulation with the overly ridiculous moments, leading to these eye-rolling proportions that were just eating up time. Some of the death scenes themselves fall in this category, alongside a few repeat sequences of Tree's journey across the quad. The running jokes themselves also get a little stale, especially when it comes to the rival sorority sister who was directed to be a little too aggressive my taste to take seriously. Oh well, got to love those superficial characters that are meant for comedy alone right. Some unfinished story elements: While I'm surprised with how much of a story this movie had, no matter how cliché it was, there were still some underdeveloped aspects to the tale. One was a few of Tree's character development arcs, that started to blossom, only to die out like her character does. A few of these could have further expanded her character, bringing in other characters to help draw it out and adding that dynamic element I like to see. In addition, a few other plot elements were squeezed into the film in a rushed manner, sometimes feeling out of place until they were able to draw it back in with a well-placed plot element. Had the scares been betterthis element would sting less, but the story element is a big part and could have used some fine tuning. The VERDICT:Happy Death Day is one of the more fun slasher films I have seen in a long time. It's a movie that will appeal to many with its fun pace, decent comedy, intriguing mystery, and character that keeps you invested in their life. While this was much better than my expectations, the movie still suffers some from imbalanced comedy gestures, unfinished story elements, and most importantly lack of scares. Therefore, go in there expecting a drama/comedy with a slasher twist and you've got the right approach to this movie. Yet, if you are looking for the next psycho thriller hold your horses for a Redbox rent to capitalize on your investment. My scores:Horror/Mystery/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0","

"Happy Death Day","eddie_baggins","4 June 2018","A horror/comedy shaped in the Groundhog Day repetitive nature of storytelling that worked so well for the Bill Murray classic and the more recent Tom Cruise sci-fi/actioner Edge of Tomorrow, Happy Death Day should be a real guilty pleasure but this low-budget Blum House production isn't the happy experience it promises to be.The concept is certainly there in Christopher Landon's film as Jessica Rothe's college student Tree Gelbman finds herself reliving a birthday turned death day as she finds herself murdered on repeat by a mysterious masked figure, only to find herself waking up to the same day over and over but Happy Death Day's desire to be a Scream like horror that moulds scares with self-aware comedy ends up anchoring the film down in the middle ground that holds it back from thriving in either space.Landon's feature finds itself lacking in any real suspense or scares as Tree try's to combat her masked attacker in various ways or uncover the identity of the assailant who inflicts this repetitive pain upon her, which is a shame, as you can see how Happy Death Day would've benefited greatly had we as an audience felt the terror of Tree's plight as she looks to overcome the scenario and live to see a new day.In regards to the comedy side of things, Happy Death Day does get extra points for not taking itself too seriously, even at one stage directly referencing its similarities to Groundhog Day, but the film doesn't produce any real hearty laughs, instead a few small-scale chuckles which aren't enough to bring the film up another level in light of the scare factor being near non-existent.With the genre mash-up disappointing, the film could've been saved by a genuinely surprising or revelatory big reveal of its masked baddie but sadly upon the revelation of who is stalking Tree to a repetitive death experience, Happy Death Day disappoints in this department also.Final Say - Happy Death Day isn't a hard film to watch and has a neat enough concept but this forgettable film frustrates with its inability to master either its horror elements or its more self-referencing comedic ticks, meaning that this is a day you'd wished you skipped.2 non-sanctioned breakfasts out of 5","

She has to use her infinite number of chances to find her killer.""Happy Death Day"" is much better than I thought it would be. The story has a great mixture of thrill, mystery and comedy. The story is not too predictable either. The leading character, Tree, is a jerk in the beginning, but somehow she is likable. I liked this film and I found it entertaining.","

"Happy Death Day","adamonIMDb","1 April 2019","This film reminded me of one of those straight-to-DVD trashy horrors that you find in the bargain bin of every DVD store. These films are usually entertaining for all the wrong reasons and 'Happy Death Day' is no different.I'm a bit confused as to what this film is actually supposed to be. Are we supposed to take it seriously as a horror/thriller, or should we treat it as a spoof and rip-off of 'Groundhog Day'? If it is intended to be a spoof, then maybe it isn't as bad as I first thought. But even so, it does feel incredibly cheap, trashy and low-budget and its widespread popularity is a mystery to me.'Happy Death Day' is clearly appealing to some people, but not to me. I don't know what I watched, but I wasn't impressed by it.","

"Happy Death Day","aminifatimaaa","31 March 2019","Happy Death Day is a fun and suspenseful blending of various genre tropes that is fueled by a strong lead performance from Rothe. Simultaneously surprised and disappointed it has taken me so long to watch it. A very inventive piece of brisk low-budget genre fare with exactly the right amount of humor and horror and a fine underlying layer of emotional complexity. Genuinely stunned how suspenseful the writting in this was and how mind-blowing Jessica Rothe's performance was. It's one of those things that is so outlandishly glossy, cynical, and playful that it just makes you happy movies exist.","

"Happy Death Day","buenoschiches","23 October 2017","I'm, like, still mad about this movie two days later.Seeing the positive reviews and mentions of riveting performances is really disheartening to me. As an avid movie fan (especially of the horror genre), have our standards for quality really plummeted thus far? First It Follows and now this? These movies are laughable.Is the end message here a coming of age tale of a typical mean girl who finally sees the errors in her way? Is that that the takeaway? How about some of the BIGGEST plot holes and questions that we're so quick to overlook? So, we have a girl who doesn't want to acknowledge her birthday because of the painful memory it entails after her mother's death (which isn't described in any way) and they shared the same birthday...... but we're going to make her ringtone an original track telling about it being her birthday? Uh, k.She just sees that there's a serial killer in existence in her area on the television and his victims happen to be blonde- but it's not at all described where she is, how big the campus is, etc. I initially thought the connection was that this was the man who had killed her mother and was on the loose (which would have been a better angle) but no- just a guy that kills blondes chilling in a hospital under lax security. There's the answer! When she makes attempts to thwart his murderous ways, it's almost as if he knows her or why she's there. But she's just a stranger to him- why didn't that register on his face? When it's discovered who the killer really is (which I called in the first fifteen minutes), Lori seemingly has nothing else wrong with her, but is SO jealous of a married man's affair with her roommate that she's willing to resort to murder because of it? Why not murder the dude's wife then? Did she really not think anyone would decipher that she was poisoned? Hello, stomach contents- how do you do? Also, how did Lori facilitate that Tree would think it was the serial killer who had murdered her? How does that plot line even work? It's figured out that she used her connections at the hospital (where she worked) to stage it so the serial killer would be framed for Tree's murder-- how though? How does that even make sense? She thinks the police are going to find a poisoned cupcake in her belly and assume that he made that for her and knew it was her birthday (huh) or .... WHAT? Ugh.Then we have the heartwarming moment between her and her father. Again, not giving away too much detail about how the mother passed and why this has seemingly affected her ENTIRE relationship with her father even though her birthday only comes but once a year.Lastly, it's never once explained, even casually, how Tree even acquires the luxury to be able to loop time in the first place? I mean, yeah- it sucks getting murdered every day. But why is she so lucky to even get a second shot? How does that work? Why is it happening to her? Why does this movie even exist?","

"Happy Death Day","neil-476","8 May 2018","Teresa, aka Tree, wakes up in the bed of fellow student Carter with no recollection of the drunken exploits of last night. It is her birthday and, as the day unfolds, we discover that Tree is not a very nice person. So we are quite pleased when, towards the end of the day, she is slaughtered by a knife-wielding maniac. Then she wakes up and it's her birthday again. She thinks this is some sort of weird bad dream. Until she gets slaughtered again, in different circumstances. Third time round, she freaks out. But as she continues to die on a daily basis, she gradually begins to put pieces together.Yes, you're right: it's Groundhog Day - they even specifically reference the Bill Murray classic. And it's a stroke of genius to transfer that idea into a teen slasher format, together with a dose of Butterfly Effect. This film is nicely written by comics writer Scott Lobdell. The story is good, the dialogue is fresh and fun, and Tree is a very well thought out character.And Jessica Rothe plays her very nicely, bringing out her self-centredness right from the start, but not making her so very obnoxious that we don't sympathise with her predicament as she gradually starts to change. It's an accomplished performance of a fairly complex character, and it must have been a joy for her to get such a part,I see quite a lot of college slasher-type movies in the course of satisfying my movie habit. This one starts off being very generic, but rises above that quickly. I recommend it.","

Great idea yet poorly executed. A lot of drama for a horror film, hints of Dawson's Creek. A college girl wakes up in a horny student's room, confused and baffled. She's hungover. She lives her day hanging out with her sorority. She walks down a bunch of stairs at night with no lights to guide her and no one in sight (at this point, you turn around and run like the wind) She sees a small toy underneath a bridge. She cautiously inspects it then boom here comes trouble. A weirdo appears wearing a mask and kills her. She wakes up again and we start the whole boredom all over again. The killer is obvious and in the end I leave thinking I've seen this film before.","

And while the premise does sound familiar, its execution was better then i thought it would be. I liked the pacing of this movie - at running time 1 h 35 min this movie never dragged, although it goes on the kinda same path (and i won't go into plot territory more). But the very ending and explanation of why someone was doing something with someone was kinda lame if you ask me. Overall, ""Happy Death Day"" isn't really a horror movie, but its a very entertaining mystery movie. Solid performances and directing as well as good script makes this one to kinda must see.","

"Happy Death Day","bensonmum2","2 June 2020","Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) discovers she's stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over. She wakes up in the same unfamiliar dorm room, makes the same walk across campus, has the same conversations and interactions, and is inevitably murdered. To get on with the rest of her life, Tree will have to unmask her killer before she dies yet again.This is another of those movies that I sincerely doubt was intended for people in my demographic. But it works for me. I enjoy Happy Death Day more and more with each viewing. I've now seen it three times and my rating keeps going up. What makes it special? I find the writing incredibly witty and clever. Time loop movies and television shows have been done to death, but this one feels fresh to me. I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers didn't shy away from the inevitable comparisons with Groundhog Day. Instead, they were actually smart enough to include it in the movie. And I love the blend of horror and comedy. The combination is not always easy to get right and few movies excel at it the way Happy Death Day does.In addition to the writing, Happy Death Day is blessed with a top-notch cast. Jessica Rothe is a real standout. She (and everyone involved in the film) does an excellent job presenting her character's transformation and growth throughout the film. She goes from the typical sorority b%#@h you can find in most any slasher to a well-rounded young woman with a real heart. It's all nicely done. Rothe is joined by Israel Broussard as Carter Davis - pretty much a doofus, but all-around good guy. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see where their relationship is headed.Finally, I called Happy Death Day a horror / comedy. And while that's true, the movie's really more of a rom-com now that I think about it. Sure, there are a few creepy moments and some real laugh-out-loud bits, but it's more about Tree and Carter's relationship than anything else. And a cuter couple you won't find (did I really just use the word ""cuter"").8/10","

"Happy Death Day","RforFilm","17 October 2017","Groundhog Day had an arrogant man trapped in a small town on the same day until he learned to appreciate those around him. Edge of Tomorrow had Tom Cruise repeating an alien invasion until he could figure a way to win it. Today's movie has someone repeating not just their birthday, but the day that they are killed by a psychopath. I've mentioned before that on paper, time loop stories are a great way to get to know the person suffering the consequence of reliving the day. On camera, the trick is harder as the story has to remain consistent without being too repetitive. The idea of someone having to repeat their birthday is an interesting one, considering that the older one gets, the less they care about the day that celebrates that. It may be a morose notion, but it's about the college age in which people would rather draw attention on the celebration rather then the number factor. I myself celebrated my thirtieth by taking a vacation and having dinner with the family. The movie not only gives us a character who could care less that she has a birthday, but an extra layer that I wont give away. So Happy Death Day may have a little extra for the time loop story. A snobbish college girl Theresa (played by Jessica Rothe) wakes up in the dorm room of fellow student Carter (played by Israel Broussard). Though he tries to make small talk, she leaves to go back to her sorority. She spends the day being rude and pretentious to everyone including her roommate Lori. She's also the other girl in an affair with her professor and even ignores her fathers invitation to a birthday lunch. On her way to a party, she is stalked by a hooded figure wearing her school's mascot image as a mask. She is killedbut wakes up the same morningin the same dorm room of Carter.She initially dismisses the previous night as a dream and goes on her day againonly to get killed. When she realizes she's repeating the same day over and over, she's suggested to use that time to follow potential suspects. Each day ends in death and summons her back to the beginning, but the twist is that with each day, she is growing weaker from the injuries. So despite the safety of the time loop, there seems to be a clock that is getting closer to midnight as Theresa is trying to solve her murder.The whole time loop formula has been done before, but I like how Happy Death Day has used it in a horror context. Did it generate a scary movie? Well I'd say that while it's shot in a suspenseful tone, it doesn't generate that many scares. I'd argue that the tone is not even full horror, but I'll get to that in a moment. But going back to it's use on the time loop, I think they did it well. I also like that they establish that her body is still vulnerable to damage from the murders, otherwise it would seem like there were no consequence. I'll say that I really enjoyed Jessica Rothe in the lead. For someone who initially has to start the film in an unlikable manner, she carries the story and really makes you want to see her redeem herself. What the marketing seems to hide is that Happy Death Day is a part comedy. While I'm no sure why the trailers didn't want to spoil that notion, but I laughed more then I thought I was going. Because the film is still trying to be scary, it does suffer from inconsistency. I think it would have made sense to try and be a little more funny, something in the vein of Evil Dead or Drag Me to Hell. That would at least justify the PG-13 rating that is hindering this story of it's full potential. Those hoping for a lot of blood are not going to see it. I'll also bet that the film war originally produced with an R rating, only to get cut down to try and get in a teenage audience. Come on! Teenagers are already aware of these kinds of college dangers. They would have been fine with an R rating.I'll give this six red birthday candles out of ten. Happy Death Day feels like a great movie that was edited by cowards who thought they knew what was best. I doubt ill see this again as it is, but I'll be on the lookout for a directors cut. Maybe that'll add back in that extra violence and jokes that are apparently too much for the studio","

"Happy Death Day","paul-allaer","14 October 2017","""Happy Death Day"" (2017 release; 96 min.) brings the story of Theresa (""Tree"")'s birthday. As the movie opens, she wakes up not knowing where she is (a guy's dorm room). Her phone tells her it's Monday. September 18, her birthday no less. The guy is Carter, with whom Tree partied the night before. Theresa takes the walk of shame back to her sorority house, where her sorority sisters are curious about the mystery guy she fell for. Later that evening, when Tree is going to another party, she is followed by a creepy baby-masked guy, who eventually stabs and kills her. Immediately, Tree wakes up and it's again Monday, September 18, 9:01 am. What is going on here? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest horror movie of director Christopher Landon, who previously also directed ""Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones"", among others. Here Landon, working from a script by Scott Lobdell, essentially revisits ""Groundhog Day"" for the horror genre. Set on the beautiful (fictional) campus of Bayfield University, Tree has an even worse day than Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, as she knows that each day will end in death. Why is this happening to her? How can she make it stop? And who is the killer? These are the questions we want answered, and keep us guessing. The movie's got a nice rhythm to it, and there are some funny moments too. In the movie's very first seconds, the Universal musical theme starts, and restarts, and restarts again, a clever ode and sing of things to come. The movie is helped immensely by the likable Jessica Rothe, here in a leading (and break-out) role as Tree. She leads a cast of mostly no-names, and that suits this film perfectly fine. At a certain point, Tree lands in the hospital, and the doctor examining her concludes ""Technically you should be dead"", ha! Considering this movie's production budget was less than $5 million, a mere peanuts in Hollywood these days, this movie is bound to be successful no matter what.""Happy Death Day"" opened wide this weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely (although not quite a sell-out). There is a good reason this movie is rated PG-13 It is MILES away from the all-out horror-porn that you find in the ""Saw"" franchise (which is rebooting later this month with ""JigSaw"") and similar over the top movies. ""Death Happy Valley"" is clever, sometimes scary, other times funny, always fast-paced, and before you know it the hour and a half has come and gone just like that. I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","

It's a fun movie that many people will enjoy, even those who hate horror movies. I feel like the advertising for this movie lead many people, myself included, that it would just be one more very forgettable horror movie that is uninspired and boring. But that really is not what Happy Death Day is. The movie has a plot like Groundhog Day, but with a teenage murder mystery angle thrown in. Yes, the plot involving a person repeating the same day over and over has been done many times and in many different forms, but I really didn't think the plot was tired or really unoriginal. It throws in a couple twists and turns just when the audience thinks everything is all figured out. Everything's not always completely as it seems. And the cast does a great job with their performances. The main stars really impressed me. They handled their characters very well. The two main stars had really lovely chemistry too, that made everything more enjoyable. That's another word to describe the movie overall, enjoyable. This really is one to watch when you want something pretty light too. If you're looking for some good ol escapism, this is a good pick. 8/10 for happy death day.","

When does Hollywood get off the hook? When do new filmmakers try to learn something from filmmakers like Sam Raimi, George Romero, Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and others? When will they see that, with low budgets, fantastic horror movies have been made (and do, as in the case of Asian cinema)? Why insist on mediocre formulas so often repeated?

"Happy Death Day","mckenzie_kyle-12260","24 July 2018","This movie is just bad.Can't say I was expecting much, admittedly. The cringeworthy trailers and bad press it has been receiving led me to believe that it would be a less than exhilierating cinematic experience, but I figured I would give the movie a go nevertheless.My first complaint would be that the idea has been done to death. The whole 'Groundhog Day' routine has become stale. This movie doesn't present enough of an interesting plot line or characters to warrant me sitting through the same scenario multiple times. Without risking spoilers I would like to just warn everyone not to get their hopes up about the ""reveal"". It is painfully delivered and possibly one of the weakest excuses for a plot twist I have ever seen.When evaluating this as a part of the horror genre... well... it doesn't belong to the genre even remotely. Any violence or gore is shyed away from each time the protagonist is killed because it instantly cuts to her waking up. I'm not saying blood and guts are necessary to a horror film (see It Follows) but I was at no point in this movie even remotely spooked in the slightest.In terms of redeeming qualities, I felt that the acting was adequate, given the poor script the actors were left to deal with. There were some details that I enjoyed about the film, for example the admittedly witty sticker on the door of the room the protagonist finds herself waking up in repeatedly. But aside from these minor things, this movie really doesn't deliver in any way. Poor.","

On the way, however, a knife-wielding stranger murders her.Instead of dying, Tree wakes on her birthday in Carter's dorm room.By applying the time-loop dilemma to the slasher genre, this low-budget thriller manages to create something new with the repeating day narrative.

"Happy Death Day","sossevarvo","11 October 2017","I wasn't looking forward to this film particularly. The whole ""Groundhog Day"" gimmick seems to have already exhausted most of its potential, and the premise of this ""horror Groundhog Day"" was hardly inspiring, especially considering Blumhouse's growing credibility as a genuine producer of great horror after Get Out and Split storming the box office. This is why I was surprised to have enjoyed Happy Death Day for a good while... until it totally falls on its face. Fresh face Jessica Rothe is solid, managing to be charismatic and repellent in equal measure. The satire of college life, while in unmistakably broad, is funny for a good while, as are the repeated vignettes that greet Tree (10 points to Hollywood for that name) along her torturous cyclical ""death day."" It's all very fast and entertaining, with a handful of genuinely funny moments (mostly due to game performances from an ensemble clearly having good fun). Even the scares are decently done, with ample tension and genuinely unpredictable moments. The problem is when the movie tries to hit you with its message. There are early signs the movie is dumbing it down (a few times extraneous flashbacks are employed to remind the audience of plot details they may have forgotten) and the bloodless, profanity-less (yes, ""fricken"" is uttered) PG-13 pander is not ideal. I understand the value of the under 17s in boosting the box office for a film like this, but the audience shouldn't so obviously be aware that a certain rating is trying to be achieved. Once the third act character arc hits its emotional peak, where Tree inevitably sees the error of her ways, the screenplay goes from fun and occasionally witty to lowest common denominator soap opera, with lines so heavy handed, complemented by a ridiculously oversentimental score punctuating each beat, that you can't help but feel the studio thinks you're stupid. A few admittedly implausible but nonetheless engaging twists towards the end help things a bit, but overall Happy Death Day while entertaining is severely undone by its willingness to dumb everything down. Everyone loved Get Out, Blumhouse, you don't need to assume your audience is stupid to enjoy a film!","

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. First of all, it was good-I was expecting your average teen horror film. Second, it had a good story with surprising twists and that is probably because the writer of the movie is Scott Lobdell. If you are a comic fan, specifically of the X-Men, then you probably know the name. If not, he wrote on some movies too, such as X-Men:Days of Future Past & Man of the House. It's directed by Christopher Landon, who also directed the Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse & Paranormal Activity:The Marked Ones. Jessica plays a not very nice college girl that gets stuck in a Groundhog Day scenario. It's her birthday and she gets killed by the end of the day. She then wakes up and relives the day, again and again. Her killer wears a school mascot mask that is kind of creepy-it looks like a baby's face-and each death is different, since Jessica tries different things to no avail-she still ends up dead. Israel is the first person Jessica sees when she wakes up-she wakes up after a party in his dorm room. Ruby is her college roommate-she is the first person to wish her a happy birthday. Rob is in the local hospital, where Ruby works as a nurse trainee...but I better not say too much about his occupation. It's better if you don't know too much ahead of time. There is lots of humor, too. I liked it when a character mentions the movie Groundhogs Day and Bill Murray to Jessica and she says she doesn't know either one. There is also a lesson to be learned by Jessica-if she learns it, will the Deja Vu loop of death finally end? Look for the opening credits where the Universal logo is circling the earth because it repeats over & over several times. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language, drug content and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes. This movie was way better than I was expecting and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.","

"Happy Death Day","Jared_Andrews","21 October 2017","It's Groundhog Day, but with murder. What a wonderful premise.The main character, Tree (short for Teresa, she doesn't come from a hippie family with a brother named Root) wakes up with a massive hangover and a foggy recollection of the previous evening. She stumbles out of the dorm of some guy she doesn't remember from last night and heads back to her Sorority house before carrying on with a typical day in her life. We see very quickly that Tree does not treat people very well. Every passing interaction ends with her making the other person feel worse.That night she walks to what she doesn't yet realize is her surprise birthday party. On the way, she is startled by someone wearing a school mascot mask, which is a baby (no, seriously; the school's nickname is the babies). This baby mask wearing stranger gruesomely kills Tree.Then BOOM she wakes up in the same dorm to live the same day all over again because this movie is the birthday murder version of Groundhog Day. On this second time through her day, we watch a little more closely. We see every person as a suspect, every detail as a clue.Eventually she tells the dorm room guy, who is named Carter, about her whole day repetition murder nightmare. He suggests that she use her unlimited lives to figure out who her killer is, which she does with limited to zero success in sometimes hilarious and sometimes terrifying ways.At this point, we're about an hour into the movie and it is fantastic. It's sharp, moves at a brisk pace, and delivers an ideal balance of scares and laughs. Then everything begins to unravel.The plot endures an infuriating twist. All the interactions and details of her day now seem like a waste of time. I begin to wonder if any of what I watched was actually evidence that could lead us to the killer. What first appeared as the work of a master craftsperson now seems to be haphazard and meaningless filler between Tree's morning wakeup and nightly death.The ending attempts to clean up the mess, but the damage has been done. I'm left with a rather interesting question—how much can I like a movie that entertained me endlessly for first 2/3, but aggressively disappointed me in the final third? My answer: not very much. Like I said, the damage had been done. This wreckage could not be salvaged.On a lighter note, Jessica Rothe shines as Tree. She's believable in all facets, which is much more than can be said about the rest of the movie. Despite the misfire in execution of the final 30 minutes, I still love the premise. I would jump at the chance to see another Groundhog Day style movie.Ultimately, my grave mistake was thinking. If you see this movie, which I think I would actually lightly recommend, don't think about it too much and don't try to figure out who is Tree's killer. Just watch, scream, laugh and repeat.","

"Happy Death Day","Groverdox","5 February 2018","If you've heard anything about ""Happy Death Day"", you know it's basically a slasher-movie version of ""Groundhog Day"".The treatment, however, elevates the material above its familiar premise.I was, at first, unimpressed by Jessica Rothe's protagonist, the improbably named Tree Gelbman. The character seems to tick all the boxes of the typically ""badass"" heroine: she's callous, promiscuous, selfish, promiscuous, ruthless, promiscuous, and lazy. When we see she's studying medicine, we wonder how she got in; some questions are answered when we see that she is, predictably, having sex with her professor.Wow, what a bad ass!However, as Tree's ordeal unfolds, we realise we were not necessarily supposed to like this character at the outset. She was shallow and cruel, but her struggle reveals hidden depths to the character that makes you question your assumptions about such people.The movie is unfortunately not scary, which I guess is inevitable, considering the premise removes suspense from the situation - the whole point is that the character always ends up back where she was. Nevertheless, I cared about what I was watching and wanted to see how it would turn out.I actually felt like I learnt something from watching ""Happy Death Day"". I profited from the experience of watching it, which is rare for horror, and film in general.","

"Happy Death Day","phaylen","10 November 2017","I figured, as with most horror films I've tried to watch over the last few years, I'd turn this one off midway through, but I ended up completely drawn in and fascinated by this hugely well directed, well acted and well conceived film that put the fun back in horror for me. They just don't make them like this anymore. The characters were quirky, accessible and really well developed, specifically the protagonist. I've never heard of the actress who plays the primary role, but she has earned her stripes as a bonafide scream queen. Speaking of Scream, Wes Craven's great 90's saga, Happy Death Day takes me back to the greats of high concept, well thought out stories that don't have to be dumbed-down with gratuitous, hypersexualized, gory content for audiences. They're self aware, not afraid to poke fun at themselves, and invigorating to a genre that has been missing this type of cinematic adventure. Happy Death Day takes the viewer on a brilliant ride. You'll laugh, you'll jump, you'll enjoy it without feeling like you just watched a snuff film.","

"Happy Death Day","eabra48463","29 August 2018","To me, the biggest problem with ""Happy Death Day"" is that the main character is annoying and entirely unlikable. We have to watch her live her death over and over while she tries to solve her own murder, all while we hope she doesn't survive so we can end the ordeal. The movie is entertaining in some ways, mostly from the premise itself, but it is executed poorly. The dialogue is weak and most of the characters are cardboard cutout stereotypes; and the film doesn't deliver anything we haven't seen before. For a relatively low budget horror film, it's not bad, but it's also not very good either.","

"Happy Death Day","Woodyanders","28 November 2018","Self-absorbed college student Tree (a delightfully tart and spirited performance by the fetching Jessica Rothe) finds herself trapped in a nightmarish continual cycle in which she reexperiences the day she was murdered over and over again until she figures out the identity of her killer.Director Christopher Landon keeps the involving and tricky story moving along at a brisk pace as well as expertly builds plenty of tension, maintains an engagingly breezy and sardonic tone throughout, and stages the shock set pieces with skill and flair. Scott Lobdell's clever script offers lots of neat variations on the time loop premise, further spices things up with amusing touches of inspired sharp humor, and even provides a surprisingly touching transitional arc for Tree in which she eventually learns to become a better and more considerate person.Moreover, it's acted with zest by a game and capable cast, with especially praiseworthy contributions from Israel Broussard as bumbling nice guy Carter, Ruby Modine as sweet roommate Lori, Charles Aitken as hunky professor Gregory Butler, and Rachel Matthews as the snarky Danielle. Rothe's winningly brash persona keeps this movie humming and makes Tree an easy character to both root for and care about. Bear McCreary's robust score hits the rousing spot. Toby Oliver's glossy widescreen cinematography gives this picture an impressive slick look. A super fun and satisfying winner.","

"Happy Death Day","TheMovieDiorama","27 February 2018","Even with the concept of replaying the same day injected into the horror genre, I couldn't help but slide into my seat thinking ""oh damn this is predictable"". Essentially a young girl (who happens to be the most unlikeable teenager in the universe) is murdered. However, she relives the same day over and over again where her death resets the day. With unlimited lives, she must attempt to find her killer so that she can escape this time loop. Whilst this never ending time loop is never truly explained, and really just feels forced as a gimmick, take the film with a pinch of salt and you'll enjoy it. A combination of 'Groundhog Day' and 'Scream', it feels more like a comedy than a horror/slasher. So if you are hoping to be on the edge of your seat...you'll be disappointed. Fancy having a laugh? Then you'll love this. We all know I'm emotionless, so for the film to evoke laughter from me is an achievement. Jessica Rothe was flat out excellent, carrying the entire story on her shoulders. Her dialogue execution was on point and her comedic timing was sublime. The supporting cast...not so much. It's all focussed on Rothe and it works. The antagonistic serial killer is your average horror movie mask-wearing maniac. The reveal was underwhelming but a small little twist at the end makes it more memorable. Replaying the same scenes repeatedly with slight differences is always a love/hate affair. I love the small details that change each time, however watching the same scene over and over again may not always be engaging. Having said that, I was compelled for the most part. Oh, and one small line of dialogue that jests about deaf people and sign language did somewhat have me in stitches...does that make me a bad person? Overall, Happy Death Day is enjoyable as a comedic slasher flick albeit flawed in concept and occasionally underwhelming.","

"Happy Death Day","hellholehorror","15 January 2019","I really enjoyed this! The concept is not the most original but the interpretation is fantastic. The film is funny, charming and the story powers through never really getting boring. Sound design and filming are strong. The lead girl is charismatic and charming to watch even at the start when she isn't the nicest person. Some of the background acting isn't very good. There are some scary moments but no gore or anything lasting scary. It's more about the story, the twist and the charm.","

"Happy Death Day","questl-18592","2 November 2019","Happy Death Day is a fun movie. It's part slasher, part comedy with a dash of Groundhog Day's schtick and a touch of counter horror's tendency to poke fun at the traditional horror tropes.The whole thing could fall pretty flat if not for Jessica Rothe's wonderfully engaging energy. Seeing her growl or rage in frustration one moment only to slap on a huge smile the next is wonderfully entertaining. It's definitely the kind of performance that makes me want to see her in more roles.Aside from that, it's just a fun ride overall. It's not a transcendent piece of filmmaking but it also isn't trying to be. It's exactly what it wants to be and I can respect that.","

"Happy Death Day","scottm18","2 November 2017","Wow..this is really a rip-off of Groundhog Day--they even acknowledge it in the movie. It also had wooden acting, inconsistencies galore and zero scare factor (the PG-13 rating was a dead giveaway as that's as bad sign in a horror movie). The lead actress looks like she could be on her way to some success...but just not in this. The most irritating part for me (not giving anything way due to trailer) is that no matter how long or short she 'lingers' on the repeated opening scenario...the next sequence of events are always in the same. That just wouldn't be the case IRL. Anyway. I wanted to like it as it had good premise, but it just didn't do it for me.","

"Happy Death Day","Pjtaylor-96-138044","24 October 2017","'Happy Death Day (2017)' is a horror-comedy that very knowingly takes the core conceit of (or at least popularised by) 'Groundhog Day (1993)' and smashes it together with the slasher genre. Where most pictures of the kind would try to scare or shock, this sets its sights solely on trying to entertain, using the language and influences of both its primary styles to provide a roller-coaster ride that has a good amount of edge but also knows when to pull back and have some fun. The result is a piece which isn't scary and isn't funny but is certainly enjoyable throughout, even if the ultimate 'whodunnit' reveals are a little disappointing and the machinations of the plot never quite come full circle (to the point that a few holes start to emerge). It actually manages to maintain a decent and non-repetitive pace that doesn't ape its most key inspiration all too often - although it does do just that, in the broadest of strokes, on a number of occasions. 7/10.","

"Happy Death Day","BandSAboutMovies","28 February 2018","You may say that horror is on the rise, with It being the highest grossing genre film ever and Get Out being considered for major awards. But give us the 70's and 80's, when you had a murder's row of slashers and horror flicks to choose from every week at the movies or drive-in, instead one or two to pick from.Written by comic book scribe Scott Lobdell and directed by Christopher B. Landon (Disturbia, that's not even a word), the elevator speech for this film is pretty simple: it's Groundhog Day meets Halloween. Yes, every single day, Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbma wakes up and is horribly killed, only for the same day to start all over again. And again.Tree makes the heroine's journey from self-centered mean girl to action-ready final girl across the span of around two week's worth of being brutally murdered. The twist that a serial killer is involved suddenly grounds the film where previously it seemed like it was shooting for the giallo, where everyone and anyone could be the killer. That's where Becca checked out.Me? I liked it. I didn't like the end of the film allusion to Groundhog Day, with Tree admitting that she'd never seen it. It seemed like such a Scream way to get around the biggest issue this film has - it's only original because it's a mash-up of previously made movies. There's also a scene set exactly like Sixteen Candles, but this is where I realize that I'm old and that this film's target audience has probably never seen a John Hughes movie.Happy Death Day was in development for a decade, starting as Half to Death with Megan Fox attached. Director Landon even did a rewrite way back when, so when the film's producer remembered that at a meeting, she brought up the unfilmed script. Thanks to his work on the Paranormal Activity series, Blumhouse was quick to greenlight the film.The baby mask was designed by Tony Gardner, the same guy who made the Ghostface mask for Scream. There was a chance that it almost was a pig mask, but the evil baby killer face that keeps showing up in the film is pretty unsettling.There's talk of a sequel, which probably wouldn't have happened if the film ended the way it was originally intended to. In that version, we'd follow Tree to the hospital after meeting up with the real killer and she's murdered in the hospital by a nurse - who ends up being Dr. Butler's wife Stephanie, in revenge for the affair that she is having with her husband. What a downer, right?Here's the weirdest part of the movie. There's another film called Before I Fall that has the exact same plot, where a girl has to live the same day over and over again, trying to make things better but still dying. That'd be fine if the trailer for that film wasn't on the DVD for Happy Death Day! Talk about weird placement. Hey - our film may only seem original until you see a trailer for a film that you may be confused into thinking is the same film you're currently watching.Maybe my steady diet of Sergio Martino and Joe D'Amoto movies has made me crazy, because I expect more weirdness in every film I watch. That said, this is a mainstream Hollywood film made for teens and tweens, so perhaps I should have tempered my expectations. It's good, but it never makes you jump, it never really makes you think (pther than the gigantic plot hole that if each death starts adding up, even after the happy ending isn't going to be so happy, but that's just ignored) and it passes by rather quickly.","

"Happy Death Day","pennytsg","17 November 2017","I truly not recommend this movie to anyone. In the first ten minutes, it seems kinda cool, but after that the girl keeps dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up, and dying, and waking up.. Also, it is pretty obvious who wants to kill her from the very beginning of the movie. It is so pointed out that she is being such a bitch to her roommate, that you can guess that it is her who wants to harm her. More over, at some points, the movie tries to hard to be funny. The only part that i smiled (not laughed), it was when her boyfriend pranked her in the end. I found the other parts really lame. To sum up, as I've already said, this may be my last review, cause I almost died of boredom. Not trying to be a bitch, but it was a disaster for me.","

"Happy Death Day","redrobin62-321-207311","21 August 2018","I've gotta take my hat off to Jason Blum. The guy knows how to make money. Who else is known for spending $3 to $5 million on a movie and getting back ten to twenty times the amount? He definitely has a magic touch. I WANT to be Jason Blum!That said, could I bring myself to fund a movie like ""Happy Death Day""? I'd hate to admit it, but if I knew I'd make $50M for my $5M investment, I guess I would. This flick was probably written by a college freshman for an audience aimed directly at his peers. The acting was so-so, the story made no sense, I've never seen a hospital so empty, all the characters were cliches, and did I say the story made no sense?Why'd I watch it knowing what I was getting myself into? Blumhouse has been a winner in my book. There stories are fairly basic - beginning, middle and end with a few twists thrown in for good measure. In other words, you know going in that it won't be a complete waste of time and it wouldn't dethrone ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" from any Top Ten movie lists. You pay what you get for - 90 minutes of so-so scares, if that's your thing.","

"Happy Death Day","sfwriter999","18 October 2017","I'm a big fan of Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow, and Triangle. I had high hopes for this as there's a formula for this genre of try again until you succeed movie. In Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow, the main character is unlikable with character flaws and as the character explores his world and tries to figure out what he/she needs to do to get out of the time loop, they through learning experiences become a better person and get past their flaws. In Groundhog Day, a selfish person becomes charitable. In Edge of Tomorrow, a coward becomes brave. In Triangle, the victim becomes the stalker.In Happy Death Day, the selfish becomes caring.In the the other three mentioned movies, the lessons learned are over a long time and through experimentation. In Happy Death Day, the experimentation happens, but the break through comes too easily. In the earlier scene before the character turn, she is still mean. Afterwards, she's suddenly nice as if through a eureka moment. We don't see the change and she's suddenly nice.Too much time is spent on the first kills which take up too much screen time. The kills are not that innovative or funny. More time should have spent on her character development. At one point, I thought, why don't she just tear the mask off the killer? Then she'll know who it is even though she'll die.The non-supernatural killer also popped out of nowhere with no reason as to how the killer found her. At some point, I thought there was some supernatural agency, but there wasn't.The love story is a bit facile too. Just because the guy tried to save her life, she falls in love with him. A bit pat.Anyway, a good high concept idea that's executed poorly. This okay movie could have been much, much better.","

"Happy Death Day","Hellmant","20 October 2017","'HAPPY DEATH DAY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A horror film about a college student that's murdered on her birthday, and then keeps waking up the previous morning, having to repeat the same day until she can find out who her killer is and stop them. It was directed by Christopher B. Landon (who also helmed the 2015 zombie horror flick 'SCOUTS GUIDE TO THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE'), and it was written by Scott Lobdell. The film stars Jessica Rothe, Israel Broussard, Rachel Matthews and Ruby Modine. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's a huge hit at the Box Office as well. I absolutely loved it! Tree Gelbman (Rothe) is a very popular student at her school, who's having an affair with a married teacher and likes to party and drink a lot. She wakes up in the dorm room of a much less popular student than her, named Carter Davis (Broussard). Tree then rushes out of his room, embarrassed by what she's done, and goes about her day, which happens to be her birthday. Later that night she's murdered by a masked killer, and the next day she wakes up the previous morning, having to repeat the same day again. Tree discovers that she'll have to keep doing this, until she can learn the identity of her killer and stop them.There's been so many movies now that take a different spin on the 'GROUNDHOG DAY' storyline (like the equally excellent 'BEFORE I FALL', from earlier this year), that it seems like it should be it's own film genre by now!. This movie manages to do it in a pretty fresh and somewhat creative way though, and it's a hell of a lot of fun. Especially if you love horror flicks (like I do). Rothe is great in the lead, and Lobdell seems to be an awesomely talented director at this film genre. I can't wait to see what he does next, and I definitely recommend this movie as a Halloween treat!Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/oV2G3RUT234","

"Happy Death Day","bkrauser-81-311064","11 October 2017","Isn't it weird that we've gotten two different teengirl versions of the Groundhog Day (1993) format in the same year? It's a little weird right? Granted there's a slight difference between the two. One centers on a selfish, white, blonde antihero whose conceited worldview is put into question when blood spilled over the course of the day forces them into an unexplained never-ending time-loop. The other is about a selfish, white, blonde antihero whose conceited worldview is put into question when blood spilled over the course of the day forces them into an unexplained never-ending time-loopin college. That and the blood spilled is her own which actually makes Happy Death Day a tad more fun than Before I Fall (2017).Happy Death Day follows college student and proto-walking disaster Tree Gelbman (Rothe), as she tries to avoid the fact that Monday the 18th is her birthday. After managing to p**s off the lion's share of campus including an ex, a professor's wife, most of her sorority sisters and her father, Tree is unceremoniously dispatched by a masked murderer while in transit to a party. In a twist of fate, Tree has the chance to relive her final day again and again in order to solve her own murder.As with any movie of this stripe that isn't written by Harold Ramis and Danny Rubin, Happy Death Day writes itself into a corner and begins to fall apart by the last act. What's worse is because the film is jamming its lofty premise in the lurid, sensationalist mode of a slasher movie (or about as sensationalist as a PG-13 can be), the reveals are all but guaranteed to be anticlimactic.That said, if you forgive the narrative clumsiness you can still walk away thinking this movie is a lot of fun. As our resident Mean Girl Jessica Rothe is perfect fodder for all the comically staged deaths that stop just short of turning the film into an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon. As the stakes get raised so too does her status from a screaming first-girl-dead to a semi-resourceful last-girl-standing. Granted her instincts are more High School Drama club than ""I'd like to thank the Academy,"" but for a movie like this it just works.As far as Blumhouse Productions go, Happy Death Day has more in common with Darwin Awards (2006) than this year's Get Out (2017). There are a lot of bad decisions both amongst the characters and throughout the plot. But the one truly great decision this film made: to be a comedy, makes it all worthwhile. Check it out if for no other reason than to see the third best film about a character reliving the same day over and over. If however you haven't seen Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow (2014), check those out instead.","

I think the funnest part of the film was evaluating who had on dentures or not. AND it seemed like there were quite a few stars who had had them. obviously these party animals enamel had been damaged and we were left as an audience to guess how the happy ending might end up. don't get me wrong, there are some twists within the film.incompetent hospital staff etcetera. jokes? no no..not many. babes? no no..and the brunette ? well, she seemed to be about 150 pounds and maybe 5 ft 6inches tall....overall it kinda had a HEATHERS like vibe to it....but whether or not the boy the girl repeatedly ends up starting her day over again with is actually that one guy in Dunkirk remains to be investigated....youde have to look up the cast of both films to see if they match up.","

"Happy Death Day","stevenclayalcander","24 October 2017","Movie with the time loop concept is interesting but really need many good elements in it. It must contain good story, morale message, and also the brilliant plot twist is a must. And what makes this movie great ? Yeah it because Happy Death Day has all of the important element. Simple story with popular girl in university, with good directing, the repeated scene because of time loop doesn't seem boring. They can make the audience to be curious and sometimes with extra comedy it makes this film really great !No doubt you will like this horror thriller movie because it is not similar like usual horror movie with some ghost, devil, or mysterious phenomenon. Its more like thriller movie with mysterious psychopath that kills you and you just cant escape from it. Even if I think this movie is brilliant, I admit that with this film concept like this, I like better if the movie genre is drama because it can offer you much more emotional, dramatic, and better morale message.","

"Happy Death Day","acidburn-10","15 December 2022","'Happy Death Day' is an entertaining flick that blends horror, comedy and slasher genre elements with a hint of romantic comedy thrown into the mix, because why not and let's not forget a premise borrowed from the classic Bill Murray movie 'Groundhog Day', which results in a pretty entertaining experience with plenty of laughs and thrills for good measure.The plot = A college student Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) must relive the day of her murder repeatedly in a continuous time loop that will only end when she discovers her killer's identity.I honestly can't believe that no-one's ever used the 'Groundhog Day' premise for a horror movie before (that I know off) and here it's effectively used with its tongue planted firmly in its cheek and really has a blast with it. The mystery element really works well here also as the story unfolds day by day it takes a few twists and turns, especially regarding the killer's identity which honestly took me by surprise. Even the repetitive structure (which may not be for everyone) plot device works perfectly when it comes to providing laughs or the odd frightening chills. But don't go into this expecting a straight up slasher flick with gory kills or you will be sorely disappointed.The performances are strong here with Jessica Rothe providing an engaging performance as the lead Tree, the character is utterly unlikeable at first, but as the film progress you discover layers to her character and she carries the film rather well.Overall 'Happy Death Day' is an absurd thrill ride with a charming lead performance and an interesting plot with plenty red herrings to keep you guessing throughout. So this flick was silly energetic fun.","

"Happy Death Day","Coventry","4 December 2019","The idea behind ""Happy Death Day"" isn't new. Duh, everybody knows that! But wait, actually, I'm not talking about the obvious link with ""Groundhog Day"". Practically every reviewer around here already referred to the Bill Murray classic, and even the film itself mentions it as an obvious influence. What I mean is that more or less the same plot concept has already been used in the horror genre as well. In 2006, at the Brussels Fantastic Film Festival, I saw a neat little movie called ""Gruesome"" (also known as ""Salvage"") and the plot is identical to ""Happy Death Day"". That film ended up in total indie-obscurity, whereas ""Happy Death Day"" became a tremendous big hit. Too bad, because ""Gruesome"" is a fun and competent, albeit insignificant little horror gem. And ""Happy Death Day"" is just that, too!I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed this light-headed, tongue-in-cheek and spirited horror comedy. Director Christopher Landon (""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"") knows exactly what type of ambiance a tale such as this requires. The film luckily doesn't take itself seriously, and in that case, I also mercifully forgive the copious errors in logic & continuity, as well as the lack of excessive gore & bloodshed due to the dreadful PG-13 rating. Tree - short for Theresa, apparently - is a college student of the most obnoxious and loathsome sort. In fact, her entire sorority behaves like the girls in the hilarious series ""Scream Queens"". Tree thinks she's better than everyone else, humiliates her fellow students, sleeps around with professors, and is generally unpleasant to be around. She gradually changes, however, when she's unwillingly forced to relive her last day (simultaneously her birthday) over and over again because it always ends with getting butchered at the hands of a mean killer with a baby mask. Why a baby mask? Because it's the mascot of the local campus football team, and the masks are sold in every shop on every corner of the street, so literally everybody can be the killer. I must admit I really loved the performance of lead actress Jessica Roth. She carries the film seemingly without effort, her transformation from a cold-hearted shrew into a likable heroine almost comes naturally, and she has good chemistry with her male co-star Israel Broussard. ""Happy Death Day"" is a slasher, and I still think that slashers must contain extreme violence, and therefore cannot be rated PG-13. Hence, I can't bring myself to give a rating higher than 6/10, but it was a fun little movie and I will definitely watch the sequel(s).","

"Happy Death Day","damion-891-180122","7 November 2018","So I'm literally 7 minutes and 48 seconds in the movie this girl was so rude to everybody, literally everyone she met that I don't know how they will make me fill sorry for her in the end. I know they want to make us believe that the killer could be anybody but come on. Also she can drink herself into coma but Save me Lord from the milkshakes and carbs. I just watched the whole thing and nothing special. Basically Groundhog Day meets Ghost but its neither a love story or to be a ghost haunting her killer. The description of the movie kinda threw me away that she is actually dead and she finds her killer as a ghost but its not. Also I know the answer but in the end how do we know that she is now a good person since when she tried to be nice she died? Hope my review helps you choose better movie than this one and for me it was more about the number on my watchlist - this one makes 2116 movies so moving to the next one :)","

"Happy Death Day","eparazak","16 October 2017","Happy Death Day is a movie about a university student who, on her birthday, manages to get killed by an unknown masked person. After the experience, she wakes up and realizes that she is reliving said day. While she is repeating this process, she decides to begin tracking down the person who is repeatedly slaughtering her.Now going into this movie I didn't really expect that much. A horror movie such as this one simply looked like one where jumpscares would be very common. To an extent, I was right; there were a lot of jumpscares in this film and only a couple were effective. The first one, for instance was effective because you couldn't see it coming, but they stopped being effective directly afterwards because I had an idea where the plot was going to go with every repeated day. In a way, the movie fails at being a horror due to its predictability. This movie also has some major plot holes that I would discuss, but that would dive into spoiler territory.As for the stuff that I enjoyed in the film, it does get entertaining sometimes and many of the jokes were pretty funny. The relationships between the main character, the love interest and the dad eventually began to grow on me. If there's one thing that the movie somewhat succeeds in as a horror, it's the fact that it does deal with some of the repercussions of fear and what it can do to one's body and that's kind of scary when you think about it.Overall I really did enjoy this movie when it felt more like a dramedy. However, when it turns back into a horror film, for the most part Happy Death Day turns into an ineffective horror movie that is intended on using predictable jumpscares as a means to scare people, leaving that aspect of the films very weak.6/10","

"Happy Death Day","XueHuaBingYu","20 January 2022","It was kind of a great film until you try to think about what causes time loop that let Teresa relive the day over and over again. I kind of want to know how she's in time loop to save herself from being killed. Sadly, they didn't explain it. Or they didn't know how to explain it? Who knows.Anyway, this film has quite a mystery of who the hell is trying to kill her and the reason behind it. It was indeed interesting. So, if you just watch the film in the way they want to show you and don't try to think some scientific explanation(s), this film is a great one to enjoy.","

"Happy Death Day","colewaters","13 October 2017","Happy Death Day is a fantastic horror/ comedy blockbuster hit. Every second of this movie was non stop fantastic. The acting in the movie was on point from start to end. The way the film was directed was hands down gorgeous this film better get nominated for an Oscar for the acting and the directing. Happy Death Day is a perfect teen film for teens to go see with their friends.Parents this is a film that if you want your kids to have nightmares all night long. The film is very unique, but while being unique it is extremely wonderful I have to say that Happy Death Day is one of the best horror films ever and one of the best comedy movies ever. This movie was a huge surprise I knew it was going to be a good movie but it was a fantastic movie it just got better and better.My score 10/10","

"Happy Death Day","superstradivariusboys","8 June 2022","Okey, I have to admit that I found this film rather sympathetic.However, I was hoping for a little more for a film called ""happy death day"", although the number of murders shown on the screen is correct, the methods are quite poor, too classic, nothing that really makes us anxious .It would have been a good opportunity to show original murder.Otherwise the actors are good, especially Rachel Matthews in her minx role played to perfection.It's a pretty fun movie to watch, especially since you feel the movie tries not to fall into the clichés of the lame teen movie, while using the clichés inherent in this kind of movie in a good way.","

"Happy Death Day","ramonster_uk","26 October 2017","This movie is a 15 certificate in the UK and I have little to no idea why it was rated this, it is tame! It appears this was far more intended to be a comedy and not a very good one at that. I didn't hate the movie, but I was also looking forward to it finishing. I read that this movie was going to have more graphic deaths and a different ending, both of these would have helped the movie from being what it currently is, a below-average teen comedy. At the end of the day it is not a terrible movie, but also doesn't deserve its over-inflated score on here at the moment, I thought my 5 out of 10 was generous! Stick with the old Scream and Final Destination movies, you'll have a much better time.","

"Happy Death Day","ThomasDrufke","15 October 2017","We've had a nice little resurgence of great horror films the last few years, and Happy Death Day is no different. It's really not all that scary of a film, only presenting a few jump scares here and there. It succeeds far more as a Jessica Rothe driving force of charm, wit, and charisma.Having a bit part in La La Land, Jessica Rothe gets her first starring role as Tree Gelbman, a college student who awakens in an unknown dorm room on her birthday and finds herself reliving the same day over and over again as an unknown masked person stalks and murders her each night. As I said this isn't a film that will keep you up at night, instead, it works with its (semi) unique story structure and rapid pace. Yes, this film feels a whole lot like Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow, heck, it even mentions the inspiration at one point. But there's something to be said for a horror film to have such a fun tone and lead. Seriously, this film lives and dies with how good Jessica Rothe is.Luckily, there's a few twists and turns along the way to keep the film from falling into typical horror clichés (which is does inevitably do every now and then). However, as long as the film is entertaining and presents a serviceable script with likable performances, that's enough to keep me in the theater. Granted, the script and some supporting performances are admittedly bland. I always feel like young actors have a tough time pulling off realistic students, high school or college. The script is smart as a whole, but some individual lines are something I would expect from a really low-budget horror film, not something that would come from Blumhouse Productions.What I will say about Happy Death Day is that it's one of the few horror films that I think is pretty easy to re-watch. Nothing nightmarish attached, a very enjoyable turn from Rothe, and a well structured mystery- thriller. It's weird to say, but the horror genre is really starting to grow on me.7.8/10","

"Happy Death Day","Dark-Wolverine","29 June 2020","The movie revolves around a college student, Tree Gelbman(Rothe) who wakes up in Carter's (Broussard) room on her birthday and gets murdered over and ends up in a loop which could only be broken if she found out who her real killer is. As she gets respawned again and again and she tries to make that day day better and better,just like Groundhog Day and even that movie is referenced here multiple times.This movie was a really enjoyable ride. The best thing of this movie was Jessica Rothe as Tree Gelbman,she was really amazing as a college student.The other characters were fun to watch. The pacing was good. The music was suiting. The movie contains many twists and turns that would surely make you go ""wait,what?"". The comedy in this movie worked, mostly in the form of visual representation. It was intense at times.Overall, Happy Death Day is a fun watch but,the magic only works one time. It's a short movie, it's worth a watch for everyone.","

"Happy Death Day","jboothmillard","30 October 2017","It was a fantastic coincidence this film came out close to when I was celebrating my 30th birthday, the trailer for this scary movie looked great, a cross between Groundhog Day and Scream, ""Groundhog Slay"" if you like, from Blumhouse Productions (Insidious, Whiplash, Get Out), so I was really looking forward to it. Basically Teresa ""Tree"" Gelbman (La La Land's Jessica Rothe) wakes up on her birthday, Monday 18th September, in the dorm room of classmate Carter Davis (Israel Broussard) following a heavy night of drinking. Tree leaves and spends the day being self-centered, dismissive and condescending to her fellow classmates and previous hook-ups, ignores calls from her father, throws away a cupcake made by her roommate Lori Spengler (Ruby Modine, Matthew's daughter), and is having an affair with her professor Gregory Butler (Charles Aitken). That night, Tree is heading to her ""surprise"" birthday party, when she is lured into a tunnel, there she is murdered by a hooded figure wearing a baby mask, the campus mascot. Tree wakes up in the morning, in the same dorm as before, and the previous day's events repeat, unnerved Tree relives the same day again, but avoids the tunnel. Instead she returns to the sorority house for her party, Tree enjoys herself and quickly hooks up with her classmate Nick Sims (Blaine Kern III), but the masked killer is there, he murders Nick, then kills her. Tree is terrified to find herself repeating events all over again, she is trapped in a time loop, she avoids her death this time by barricading herself in her room, but she is murdered again when the killer, Babyface, was hiding in the bathroom. During the next loop, Tree tells her story to Carter, he suggests she take advantage of the loop, make a list of all the suspects to figure out who is trying to kill her, she spends the next few loops following suspected students, all of which end up with her murdered as she stalks the wrong person each time. Tree also takes advantage of her situation and enjoys the reactions of everyone seeing her walk around the campus completely naked. On the next loop, Tree passes out following her previous death, being bludgeoned by a baseball bat, she is taken to hospital where she finds she has retained damaged from her other murders. Then she finds herself chased by the killer again through the hospital, until she escapes in Butler's car, while driving at high speed she is pulled over by a police officer, she volunteers to be arrested to avoid being killed, however Babyface shows up and blows her up with leaking gas and a match. Waking up in Carter's bedroom again, Tree convinces him of the predicament knowing a number of events before they happen, going to a restaurant, she admits she doesn't like who she's become, including being distant from her father, since the death of her mother three years ago, they shared the same birthday. Tree sees the local news broadcast report, that serial killer Joseph Tombs (Rob Mello) is being held in the hospital, she concludes he is the masked killer. Tree races to the hospital to warn of Tombs' escape, the killer breaks free and nearly kills her, Carter follows and ends up killed by Tombs, Tree is chased into the bell tower, realising Carter will remain dead if she doesn't restart the loop, she hangs her from the tower. During the next loop, Tree spends her time righting the various wrongs she has caused, ending her affair with Dr. Butler, and meeting her father David (Jason Bayle) to resolve their situation. That night, Tree prepares to stop Tombs, he has the upper hand, but uses the knowledge of a blackout to disarm him and shoot him to death, she relieved to finally be free, and celebrates her birthday in her room, eating Lori's cupcake. However, the next morning, Tree is horrified to be waking up on her birthday again, killing Tombs did not stop the time loop, she is distraught and returns to her room to run away. Lori is there to offer her the cupcake again, Tree realises she died in her sleep, she never consumed the cupcake before, she realises Lori is the real Babyface, the cupcake is poisoned, and had access to Tombs with her job in the hospital. Lori confesses that she was jealous of Dr. Butler having an interest in Tree, the two fight, Tree manages to stuff the cupcake into Lori's mouth, before kicking her out of the window, she falls to her death. Tree and Carter reflect on the day's events back at the restaurant, he offer her his room for the night, and comments that her situation is the movie Groundhog Day. Tree wakes up the next morning, she believes she is in another loop when the first few events repeat, but then Carter tells her it is Tuesday 19th September, he pranked her, she is mad for a moment, but then they relax and kiss. Also starring Rachel Matthews as Danielle Bouseman, Phi Vu as Ryan Phan, Laura Clifton as Stephanie Butler and Ramsey Anderson as Keith Lumbly. Rothe is well cast as the college student who has so many flaws that there are plenty of people who would want to kill her, the time loop format has been done before in various genres, thrillers like Source Code and sci-fi like Edge of Tomorrow, this is one of the first in the scary movie category. It is not really that scary, it has the odd small jump and creepy element, but it is very witty, satirical with the campus setting, and making obvious jokes about its own slasher movie format, it is just an enjoyable popcorn movie and crowd pleaser, perfect if celebrating your birthday as well, a fun horror. Good!","

"Happy Death Day","cruise01","15 October 2017","Living the day. Getting murdered. And repeating the same day all over again. This how goes for Happy Death Day which is a fun slasher film that borrows the same concept from Groundhog Day film. Where the main character lives their day and gets murdered by a mysterious person in a pig mask. And repeat the day all over again. The thought of the concept may seem like it can get boring very fast with its repetition. Happy Death Day does not take itself seriously which there is no complaints about that. Since it was a fun slasher film and the director knows the direction that is aiming for. Tree (Jessica Rothe) wakes up in a dorm room after a wild night of partying. She wakes up next to Carter (Israel Broussard) which she assumed she slept with him. She goes on about her day. Trying to avoid her ex boyfriend. Ignoring her father calls after a difficult past which she has trouble moving on from. She is bored with her frat house which is judgmental to everyone's single move and choices. And it is also her birthday. As she was walking to a party at night. A killer wearing the campus mascot of a pig, chases and kills her. Then, she wakes up to the beginning of the day again. Noticing that everything is repeating itself. Every time she is getting killed. She is also getting weaker from those deaths. She will have to do whatever she can to solve her own murder by finding out who is behind the mask and what their motive is. Happy Death Day is a fun movie. Seeing Tree come back alive and trying to redo a scenario over and over is fun to see. See how she tries to figure out who the killer is entertaining. Sure, there is cheesy moments were she goes all out in night gear and night vision on trying to track down everyone on her suspicious list of people. Even, moments were she does not care and takes advantage of the whole situation when she knows she can do anything cause the day will end with her death and it will all be repeated. Jessica Rothe did good with her role. There was a bit of a character development with the movie. The movie begins with Tree waking up from a crazy party. She is not a nice person. She is rude. She sleeps around. Even with her college professor. Somewhat a dead beat towards her roommates. But the movie does have a bit of a self discovery learning curve for her. It may try to be an emotional curve, were she is realizing how wrong of a person she was. The movie does have a couple of twists that somewhat worked in the film. The concept of Tree repeating the day over and over again after being killed has been done in other films like Groundhog Day, Source Code, Edge of Tomorrow, etc. Those films have reasoning for the characters to be stuck in that time loop. One thing that disappoints with Happy Death Day is there is no reasoning behind Tree repeating the same day. Besides Tree referring the situation as déjà vu. It would have been neat if it took the supernatural approach with the character stuck in the loop. But it leaves you open for the concept with no explanation. Overall, Happy Death Day is a fairly okay slasher film. Its like Sixteen candles meets scream. It's a lot of fun. An okay plot that uses the Groundhog Day concept. But once the twist is revealed, it feels like the fun stops and the surprises leaves you with nothing to talk about. I rate the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. I recommend the film if you need a quick slasher horror movie fix if you want to see something fun.","

"Happy Death Day","mistela67","23 November 2017","I've seen many, many slasher/thriller movies, and I thought this was going to be your standard fair. Although it was, sort of, the quality of this movie was much better than what I'm used to.First, writing and directing was top notch. Most slashers have very predictable story lines, and the directing is average to subpar. This movie had a very nice storyline. It wasn't original, but it did offer an interesting twist on a known plot line. The movie even makes a late reference to Ground Hog Day (from which the plot was based). But the way they used that plot to incorporate the slasher theme was intriguing. No, they don't explain why what happens keeps happening, and I think they missed a great opportunity there. But still, it's a well-written script with some very funny parts, and quality directing and editing that drives an entertaining vision.Second, the acting. The lead actress carries this movie. She was able to go from being a true bitch, to a true victim, to very funny, to really sweet. Even a bit intimidating at points. To be able to carry this off, as an actor, shows a great deal of training and natural ability for the art of acting. I hope this actress is rewarded with more movies because she's a talent.Third, the pace of the movie is on target. Not too slow, not too fast. Good editing is an often under-appreciated talent for the general movie goer. I can say that this movie works because of how it is put together. Even the twist at the end fooled me, and these sort of slasher movies NEVER fool me. Good job.I do recommend this movie. It will make you laugh at times, and it's refreshing that the violence and gore isn't overdone. But more than anything else, I recommend this movie because it's very entertaining, has good writing, directing, and a very good performance by the lead actress.7/10","

I enjoy a film that has a good twist in the ending and that's what happened here. I would not watch if you expected a horror film as it's more of a thriller/gore than anything else.Few negatives: the acting from a couple of the smaller characters was quite wooden. And it slightly bothers me how there's no actual reason why this particular girl was chosen to be able to keep waking up again to find out who her killer was. I know it's not the main purpose of the movie I just like all things explained.But, overall it's a nice, easy watch, likeable main characters and a pretty good plot that involves a couple of twists and turns. 7/10 would recommend.","

"Happy Death Day","burlesonjesse5","9 November 2017","A snobby, college babe named Tree (played fiercely by Jessica Rothe) relives the same day over and over again by getting murdered via a fellow student. Tree's mission then becomes to find her killer and at the same time, try to be a better, overall person in the process. That's the rub of Happy Death Day, my latest review. So OK, I gotta hand it to ""Day"". Despite having a tiny budget, unknown actors, and being minuscule in scope, this film has grossed over $78 million worldwide. That's pretty impressive. Yeah you probably won't deem it unforgettable the moment you leave the theater (I know I didn't). However, there are worse ways to spend five to ten bucks on a cold, November afternoon (or are there?).Now if you've read the reviews, caught the opening Universal Pictures logo repeating itself, or have already seen Happy Death Day all the way through, you'll know that it apes 1993's Groundhog Day (obviousness reeks havoc as Bill Murray's name is attached in a wink wink ending). You can also throw in Edge of Tomorrow, facets of a 90's teen comedy, and Wes Craven's Scream for ""Day's"" manifest inspiration.All in all, ""Day"" is nifty, campy, and devoid of being too grave. It's also restrained as a so-so horror film (hence the PG-13 rating). With minimal gore, side characters that range from dopey to spiteful, a bland gimmick of die/repeat, and some slight humor, Happy Death Day never feels scary or amusing enough (that honor would go to John Carpenter's Halloween).Sure there's a whodunit element that keeps you guessing and director Christopher B. Landon profusely adds layers to his plot. Nevertheless, I can't quite go with a recommendation. Landon never times his scenes with Tree's 9-plus lives to make complete sense. His troupers around her find their marks but not every ""Groundhog Day"" effect feels totally in sync. Oh and I almost forgot, the editing in ""Day"" is swift and painless yet you don't know why Tree is going through the skewed, time continuum in the first place. Bewildered was my first and foremost thought.Typically, low budget scare fests find a way to be successful financially. With Happy Death Day, I get why fright fans salivated for an October release but I don't understand all the monetary love here. Rating: 2 stars.","

A girl relives her murder over and over, and each time, she carefully tries to avoid the bad incidents that occurred. You see the scenes being repeated somehow, but each time there's something new happening. As if it's naturally instinctive for the human mind to try to alter the trials and tribulations of life. A way of survival to be exact. This movie is a light horror for me. It's not much scary, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time. I recommend this one to you.","

"Happy Death Day","DarkVulcan29","18 October 2017","Just when you think that the day repeat thing has been overdone in movies, well your probably right even with this years Before I fall and Netflix film Naked to name some. And now Happy Death Day is here.Tree(Jessica Rothe) a beautiful but selfish college student who on her birthday is gonna get killed by a masked killer, but every time she gets killed the day keeps repeating itself, confused why all this is happening, Tree must uncover on who is trying to kill her in hopes to break the loop.I found this entertaining, it has great humor and awesome suspense. Like the Scream films has a lot of twists, just when you think you know how it's gonna end, it then pulls out more surprises you just don't see coming. Jessica Rothe is pretty good here, you don't like her at first, but she grows on you has the movie goes on. The other supporting cast are pretty good also. If you miss the old horror films with some awesome humorous moments, then Happy Death Day will fill that void for you.","

I went in with low expectations and was so pleasantly surprised and highly entertained. Jessica Rothe's acting is delightful taking the typical mean girl trope and filling it with soul and charm. In a world of remakes and reboots, Happy Death Day shines with a fun plot and great acting. Definitely worth a watch.","

"Happy Death Day","hjalsayegh","31 October 2017","I thought this was just a cheap slasher movie version of groundhog day. Oddly enough it was. Girl wakes up in a dorm room goes about her day then gets murdered before the day ends just to repeat the day again and again with her murder hiding they're identity behind a mask. Here is the surprise though. This movie is actually good! The girl is the stereotypical bitchy (or witchy if they've censored the movie like they did over here) cheerleader. Pretty much every single person in her life has a reason to want her dead. This works as you go through the list of suspects (sometimes hilariously) and don't feel bad seeing her die over and over. It more then earns the big reveal in the end and I found it to be a fun light hearted popcorn movie for Halloween. This movie got one extra point for being bold enough to actually straight up say ""hey, you know what your story reminds me off? Groundhog day, that movie with Bill Murray."" right at the end before the closing credits.","

"Happy Death Day","blanbrn","14 October 2017","This latest thriller slash horror flick ""Happy Death Day"" is one that's a feel good fun tease that looks at the theme of death happening over and over! A college girl Tree(Jessica Rothe) dies on her birthday, yet the day is lived over and over it's like each times it happens Tree wakes up! It's like a curse Tree starts to wonder is this because she sleeps around(as she's one sexy black bra wearing kind of girl!). Thru it all it becomes clear this is one nightmare that can't be escaped as it's like she can't wake up! Is it the work of a crazed released killer or is it someone on campus that the girl knows these deaths will continue to happen over and over till the killer is revealed. Overall this film is a little far out and crazy in a different way nothing like the classic slash flicks of the 80's still it's a modern day tease and fun watch for today's style on a weekend.","

"Happy Death Day","bushtony","31 October 2017","Although the core narrative is not original by any stretch, there are good reasons for liking this lightweight foray into the slasher genre. There are some original elements incorporated into the hoary old Groundhog Day chestnut – just enough dusting and polishing to make you forgive the pillaging. It doesn't aim for the same conceptual depth of, say, Timecrimes (2007), Triangle (2009), The Butterfly Effect (2004) or Edge of Tomorrow (2014) but it does manage to incorporate a nifty murder mystery thread into the time-loop motif and the execution feels a deal fresher than it probably should. Bratty, morally challenged and egocentric frat girl Tree (Jessica Rothe) finds herself living her birthday over and over again, each day ending with her murder at the hands of a masked stalker. All she has to do is find out the identity of her killer and avoid being killed in order to break the cycle. The film is not hard core or extreme in any sense that might apply to the bulk of modern slasher flicks. There are no real scares, there is no excess of blood and guts, no explicit violence, no torture porn or gratuitous sexual activity or nudity. So what does it have going for it? It's engaging, mildly funny in places and generally quite likable. Jessica Rothe is winningly cute in the lead. And not in a painfully forced or superficial way. Her gradual transition from selfish and self-absorbed sorority bitch to a more enlightened and humane persona is skilfully handled. You start out thinking she pretty much deserves her fate and then end up rooting for her to succeed. Rothe plays it just right and you can't help liking her. She is one of the most rounded and sympathetic female leads in a slasher movie since Jamie Lee Curtis in Carpenter's original Halloween (1978). In fairness, most of the cast deliver in terms of injecting some level of believability and personality into their rather clichéd stock characters. HDD deserves credit for some stylish camera-work and editing – both of which are tight, smart and in some places strikingly unusual. The key emphasis is on taking a well-worn concept, playing around with it and having fun. And that's what you've got here, a fun genre piece that doesn't take itself seriously and entertains for the running time. Unlike Scream it doesn't lose itself in self-reverential satire and admiration for it's own cleverness in ragging on genre tropes, and is all the better for it. It doesn't do anything ground-breaking or jolting, won't set the world on fire, and anyone expecting a visceral thrill-ride is more than likely to feel short-changed. But, I found it enjoyable enough, even though I'm far removed – very far removed – from its target audience. And I must add that I was wrong-footed by the ending, fully expecting the stock horror movie twist which isn't really a twist anymore – the one where you think everything's OK but suddenly evil triumphs. The twist this time around was a bit different to what I'd resigned myself to. And Groundhog Day does get a belated name check. So all in all, not bad, just about happy enough.","

"Happy Death Day","SkullScreamerReturns","31 May 2021","This movie is so bad that I don't even know where to start. Ok, let's start with the positives: I liked the dialogue in the ending ""you have never seen Groundhog Day?"" That's kind of dumb but also great - at least the movie is self-aware that it's ripping off another film.Secodly, I liked that there is They Live poster on a wall. And it even shows many times. This is the best part in the movie.Those are the good aspects. Everything else is bad. The plot is tedious and boring to follow, and it's unimaginative and copying GD riciculously. Especially the part where the main character starts to apologize and trying to be a better person. That works in GD but it makes no sense in this story and feels pretentious. This is a horror film about a murderer. Or is it? There's hardly any horror feel. Most of all it's just a teen drama with a creepy topic. And the mask the killer is wearing, that's so annoying to look at.I don't know if They Live poster deserves an extra star but that's maybe a bit strech because overall this is a movie that I found pretty much nothing good in it.","

"Happy Death Day","paul_haakonsen","23 December 2018","While ""Happy Death Day"" hardly was a groundbreaking movie, it certainly turned out to be more entertaining than I had initially anticipated it to be.The storyline is fairly straight forward; a college girl is stuck in a loop of reliving her birthday over and over and finding herself killed come evening of every day. Yeah, very much similar to ""Groundhog Day"", except for the dying horribly in a new way every day.It wasn't as much the dying repeatedly that made the movie interesting, but the way that each day progressed in an exact same way, but with little variation added each and every day. And the fact that the audience is kept fairly in the dark about what is really happening. I hadn't predicted the outcome of the movie, so it was a nice surprise to me when it was revealed what was actually going on. Especially since there weren't really any hints leading you to that conclusion.I also liked the way that the director slowly build up the storyline and added small fragments to the storyline with each passing day. I like the fact that the audience have to guess to the outcome of the storyline, because that meant the movie wasn't predictable.The acting in the movie was good, especially taking into consideration the genre of the movie. Not that I am generalizing or anything here, it is just that these late teen movies have a tendency of following the same formula. Which I was glad to see that ""Happy Death Day"" didn't abide to.All in all, ""Happy Death Day"" is an enjoyable movie and entertaining at the same time. However, this is not the type of movie that can sustain more than a single viewing, because all the excitement and thrills dissipates once you've seen the movie the first time and know the plot. So chances of anyone seeing this movie more than once is slim to none.","

It truly is a film everyone should go see, and is enjoyable for all ages. The film builds up well, and continues to succeed up until the end. The ending is very outrageous in nature, and seems to be a forced plot twist filled with ridiculous exposition. The ending will either leave you amused, or just disappointed.

"Happy Death Day","mr_bickle_the_pickle","3 October 2018","Even though the concept of time loop is not original (the film even tongue in cheek references Groundhog Day) I felt it was refreshing and original in this context. For the most part, I liked the film. Its not always straight horror. At its core its also a film about self discovery (much in the same way Groundhog Day was) and also maybe a little bit of a romantic comedy. Again, I like that it feels different from a lot of horror films out there. I also thought it worked as a decent mystery as you're trying to figure out the killer alongside Tree. That being said there was some things that didnt work for me/didnt make sense. At least in 2 of these timeloops, death is on her hands (I wont say in what context or with who) but we never see the police get involved. We see her later that day/evening with her love interest and everything seems hunky-dory. Realistically she would be arrested or at least being questioned by police. It just took me right out. Also I dont know why she didnt just get in a car and drive off somewhere a lot sooner. She always seemed to stay on campus. I get that it was probably due to the production budget, but from a story standpoint if you're trying to survive the night why wouldnt you just get in a car and drive somewhere random where nobody knows you're there. Don't talk to anyone about leaving....just go? I don't know. But I liked the cast and it was an interesting concept. The deaths are fun too and aren't too gory so if you're watching with someone who's not too big on horror, they might be ok with this.","

Anyway, I think Happy Death Day is worth watching at least once, and it's a lot of fun, and yes I've seen Groundhog Day and 12:01PM (over and over again quite appropriately!). Sure there's teen angst, sororities, scream, I know what you (still did) last summer, boyfriends, body image, reconciling with a distant dad after the loss of mom, crocs, kappas.","

"Happy Death Day","Quinoa1984","27 October 2017","Happy Death Day is the first slasher movie I can think of that we've had in theaters for a while (I don't know if I can count Hush, since that was a two-hander for the most part and was Netflix), or... no, I think I can think of a few others if I try, but the problem is much of the horror movie product put out by Hollywood is PG-13. There are some exceptions, but for the most part it's ghost story stuff and Jump-Scare Central. The pleasant thing about Death Day is that it's more concerned with the characters, and it gets those right - or, at least, it gives us a likable heroine who has an arc - and while the movie had its flaws, it does as well as it can as far as being a (somewhat bloodless) PG-13 slasher in a time when any slasher at all is hard to come by. It may have over-stayed its welcome as a genre, but any kind of movie done well is welcome for my eyes and ears.The key thing with this movie is that it takes its concept: Groundhog's Day in a modern college setting, with the Bill Murray a bitch-ish sorority girl Tree (Jessica Rothe) who has a sour relationship with her father and most everyone around her, and who happen to know the worst-kept secret around that it's her birthday, all leading up to her being killed by a guy in a creepy big-baby-man mask. She wakes up in the same hungover state she woke up in the day before, and it's the same day again... why is this happening? What's the cause? Wisely, the filmmakers don't explain it - what would work here that could be plausible (Edge of Tomorrow found a way, but that involved giant aliens with day-looping blood or something) - and instead it becomes about her journey in discovering herself and that, as the saying goes, we can change one day at a time.It's a high concept movie, the kind that Hollywood (for better and/or worse) made more of in years gone by, and it's anchored by a fun, entertaining and dramatic turn by Rothe; she can do anything that's thrown at her, and she makes the funny lines and reactions click (including, here and there, an accent or two) and when she has to get intense she carries that as well. When it comes time to reveal the killer, it almost seems too obvious, or too much like a Bob out of Twin Peaks thing, and yet... it works precisely because of that, like the filmmakers said, 'Well, it's not really about the killer, it's about Tree (damn that's a silly name, but I digress), and how she, eventually, goes from doing things each time she wakes up in her rebooted state that don't work to learning from her mistakes and trying (a little late in the game, but better late than never) to become a better person), that counts.It's actually a good message to give to younger audiences, who obviously are the main draw for this even more than horror buffs who have been around the block with slashers (again, compared to some of the stuff from the 80's this is very tame - I'd almost call it like an MTV movie when all's said and done, though for what it's worth I mean that as a compliment, I guess), that being a decent person in this time, 2017 especially, is important. The problem with the movie is perhaps more on my end, but I'm not so sure: as the movie goes along, I start to find some logic gaps, or more precisely things that Tree does that I didn't buy that, someone who clearly has some intelligence about her, wouldn't do sooner. By the time, for example, she thinks to have a weapon or two to defend herself, or decide to, I dunno, try to run away, it's very late in the story (honestly, I know there's a supernatural component to this all, however vague that is, but the fact that she doesn't at least try to haul ass out of town seems incredible to me).But I could dismiss most of the flaws in parts of the logic or little moments that didn't work because of how efficient the filmmaking is; the writing moves us along at a quick clip with the pieces of the storytelling being things we can latch on to (nothing is *too* frivolous, if that makes sense), and the direction is slick enough and often creative in its low budget, that I was along for this girl's journey as she uses her multiple lives this way and that. What bothered me the most was the ""twist"" that comes up in the final reel; I understand why they felt to throw that in there, but I didn't buy it and it comes at a point where the movie feels like it's over. Ironically, I wish there had been a little more running time put to showing her finding herself in her repeat-times, or a little more discovery of her being s***ty to people (she kind of realizes it at the 2/3rd's mark, it works but not as well as if it had come just a few scenes earlier). But it's this twist that... I dunno, it screams of being a studio note.But this is a slickly made and entertaining picture for the masses, and it takes a concept that's not over-done but is familiar for those who've seen it (and, however you think this touch works or not, they mention Groundhog's Day, albeit at the *very end* of the movie, almost like a Loony Tunes wink at us all) and gives it some fresh life. It's not amazing, but it's not anywhere near an embarrassment. It's sometimes fine, other times better than fine, and it earns its theatrical release.","

"Happy Death Day","FelipeCarrillo","3 December 2017","On this base idea is set up Blumhouse Productions' latest big hit, Jason Blum's production company has been crowned as the only studio to make a huge profit at the box office with low-budget medium-high quality films. Being its 13th flick with a respectable worldwide grossing, ""Happy Death Day"" must be considered, besides an extra proof of Blumhouse vigor and vitality, as a breath of fresh air for commercial slasher cinema, one to which, little to little, they bury it the stake further inside.The main disadvantage with the script doesn't lie in the combination of genres, otherwise, that's one of the most remarkable features of the film, the drawback is the way to tie up some loose ends, because, in fact, they are closed to so much pressure that coherence threads are abruptly detached. As a thriller, mystery whodunit, the interest of audience will be placed in the resolution of the homicide, consequently, if you want to carry the genre proudly, should manipulate the perceptions of each spectator in order to cast doubt before the more insignificant detail, here, although interesting bets are proposed in the course of the third act, the truth about who's behind the creepy mask is not a great thing at all. Inserting, unjustifiably, the subplot about a lurking criminal as a rough backdrop, inserting boring overcoming of family quarrels, inserting the stereotyped comings and goings in this kind of stories, the feature film ends up being a mildly lost opportunity, it could have formulated more surprising suspects and more intelligent endings for the unknowns, a little help: Carter. Another point, which cannot be part of the category of flaws due to the origin of its dubious purpose, concerns the absence of a clarification about temporal loops. As soon as they lay all the cards on the table, nothing more expect to conclude the game, give a coherent explication about day- restarting plot, however, there are no grounds for it, neither explicit nor implicit, simply, the idea is left up in the air, so that moviegoers produce their own clarifications, as always, a double-edged sword. Fortunately, the film keeps enough vigor, dynamic and strength in montage sets, performances and narrative circumstances that make it more than energetic, fascinating and entertaining the rebirth of our protagonist anti-heroine.As writer sets on the one side of the triumphant Blumhouse balance equation, on the other side, the director acts as a counterbalance. Although Christopher Landon's name seems Lilliputian compared with film-savvies as James Wan, M. Night Shyamalan, Oren Peli, Jordan Peele, Joel Edgerton, Scott Derrickson or Damien Chazelle; his most recent pic would be the first great milestone in his ascending career, even though he has a long, long way to enroll in the major leagues. Landon provides newness and daring for a film that could easily have fallen into muddy plots of aimless comedy, dysfunctional horror or soporific thriller; here, the filmmaker reveals his contemporary thinking by transmitting young-focused company MTV's ""Teen Mom"" on Tree's TV instead of any Hitchcock's or Coppola's classics; here, Landon places a female Bill Murray imprisoned in a college campus; drastic swaps that benefit the feel-good that radiates the ending of the film. Evaluating the work of the director through the final result, one could say that the man behind ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" has just gained a great improvement in terms of filmmaking and control is concerned, Every filmmaker who demonstrates a professional advancement deserves a heated ovation, however, taking into consideration Landon's labor, half of the continent must stand up and applaud him, congratulations, a future colleague.Uni and Blumhouse manage to deliver an entertaining contemporary story with honors, they can produce a five-star action thriller, abduction suspense one or murder-solving one, simply, shows off the aces up its sleeve and leap them, without clemency, on the face of the spectator. The particular montage, the nice pictures and the excellent score team up in a moderately phenomenal way, although, visually, they are restricted by the number of scenarios shown in the first twenty minutes, however, the lack of possibilities encourages productivity and originality that end up in magnificent films, in this case, it's testified through interesting camera movements, amazing angles, and very old-school approaches; the saying: creativity is the only weapon emerging from low-budget and narrative constraints is very true. The soundtrack deserves special mention, it seems to mock 80's horror flick, its stridency and apparent jocularity are mixed with the same functionality as the images, its melodies recall ""Scream"", and even, there are explicit scenes which lead to our memory, without any remedy, to Wes Craven's film; great job Bear McCreary, no doubt, the best aspect of the film.Christopher Landon's ""Happy Death Day"" positions itself on the throne of the horror and youthful-humored satire of the year, not merely because of its picturesque premise, but because of the appropriate levels of execution and narrative approach it presents. Although never taking itself too seriously, it serves as a fortifying incentive for the association between studios, verifying that they are on the right way, a path brimming with originality and magnetism that would not be defaced by low-budgets. Sadly, the film is left behind compared to its contenders, experimenting a sense of emptiness at the end of the showtime, shows that, at least narratively, has been a partially lost opportunity. Undoubtedly, Landon's film had the perfect tools to become huge, but with the result, it only got to be big. Let us blow out our candle of desires and we pray together for longevity and vitality of this alliance.","

The actors were okay with their performances, nothing great but not bad either concidering that I didn't know any of them. There are for sure tons of movies in this genre that are below average.

"Happy Death Day","lavatch","2 February 2018","""Happy Death Day"" could have a been a routine slasher film based on the repetitive, re-live-a-day-in-the-life technique of ""Groundhog Day."" But the snappy dialogue and comic moments turn the film into a surprisingly intriguing hybrid of styles.The conceit of the film is that the main character named Tree is being stalked by a killer on her birthday. The skillful psychopath is successful, but Tree gets a reprieve by waking up and starting the day over and over with multiple opportunities to outfox her murderer. She is a quick study in figuring out the psyche of her arch enemy.There are some ingenious twists to the film, especially towards the end. But the light touch and tongue-in-cheek approach of the filmmakers brings a much appreciated levity to the film. The parody of the sorority sisters is especially wicked.The sorority president, Danielle, has a number of creative word pronunciations and inflections, including ""Anyhoooo,"" ""Byeeeeeeee,"" ""Beeyotch,"" and ""Living for it."" She is also outrageous in her appearance with large curlers in her hair while speaking to Tree as if she were a Martian, intoning the question, ""What time will you arrive at the party"" in the staccato style of an alien. The actress playing the role of Tree is terrific, as she deftly evokes irony to her character interpretation, as well as some genuine feeling in the reunion scene with her father. ""Happy Death Day"" is a cut above the ordinary horror film. In the DVD version of the film, there is a package of deleted scenes, as well as an alternative ending. Because the film was so well-crafted, I really felt that I wanted to see those scenes and the other ending that was undoubtedly inferior to the one in the final cut.","

"Happy Death Day","FlashCallahan","16 January 2018","Tree Gelbman is a self-centered student who wakes up on her birthday with a student named Carter. As the morning goes on, Tree gets the eerie feeling that she's experienced the events of this day before. When a masked killer suddenly takes her life in a brutal attack, she once again wakes up in Carter's bed unharmed. Now, she must relive the same day over and over until she figures out who murdered her.Happy Death Day is a refreshing spin on the horror genre. Granted, it's not going to win any awards for originality, but for the sheer element of fun the narrative holds, you'll be hard pressed to find a horror that will make you laugh and squirm at the same time.It doesn't hide the fact that the film is referencing Groundhog Day within an inch of its life, or that it depends a lot on the first Scream film, especially during one of the many kills, which only adds to the charm of the film.For veterans of the genre, the identity of the killer is really easy to spot from the first act, as the red herrings are so blaringly obvious, it makes the film all the more hilarious for doing so. The baby face killer 'screams' of Ghostface from said film, but the lack,of the killers voice makes the character just that little more sinister.As expected, the film gives Tree a lot of life lessons, and some of the sequences where she repeats her day are laugh out loud funny, and frustrating at the same time.The only thing that lets the film down a little is the inclusion of a serial killer in the hospital, only because its glaringly obvious it's just to distract the viewer.But all in all, it's a refreshing spin on a much trampled on genre, horror films are three a penny these days, so it's a pleasure to see something that doesn't go down the quiet..........quiet..........quiet...........Bang!! route for cheap thrills.Destined to become a cult classic in years to come.","

"Happy Death Day","haroot_azarian","22 October 2017","If you've seen Groundhog Day and Before I fall, then you should roughly know what the movie is about. The story-line is superb for it is a comedy and horror and whodunit movie all rolled into one. This is Jessica Rothe's second movie that I have seen, the Tribe being the other one. Yes I have not seen La La Land, because I hate musicals. Suffice to say Rothe is one of those actors who play their roles very convincingly. I am glad the test audience reacted furiously to the original ending of the movie and the director opted for the alternative ending. I enjoyed it therefore I recommend it. A nice change to typical Halloween season movies!","

"Happy Death Day","drawnsupreme","25 January 2018","Happy Death Day is different. The story is unlike any other movie in it's genre, which is refreshing to see. It brings back the mystery and suspense. It will keep you guessing and anticipating to see what would happen next, which very few films have successfully pulled off.Similar to the classic movie 'Scream', there are plot twists that will keep you watching and wondering as the story unravels till the end. The main actress (Jessica Rothe) did an excellent job carrying the film as well.I thought the movie was originally rated ""R"" and I was expecting a teen slasher with a bunch of gore, but for a ""PG-13"" film, this was not bad at all. This looked interesting from the trailer... and seeing as horror movies are repetitive nowadays, my expectations were low for this film. After seeing the movie, I must say that this was definitely a good, fun flick. Definitely check it out if you haven't already!","

"Happy Death Day","paulclaassen","2 March 2020","Director Christopher Landon presents a horror film so well made and stylish, this is bound to become a classic in the vein of 'Scream' and 'I know what you did last summer'.We've seen this concept before but 'Happy Death Day' makes it feel original. I enjoyed the subtle humor thrown into this horror, as well, almost making it a horror comedy (but not entirely). Tree Gelbman - well played by Jessica Rothe - is not a very nice person, so its no wonder someone might want her dead. The film offers interesting character development and evolves into a 'who done it' murder mystery. The acting from the entire cast was very good.Director Landon successfully made this look like a bigger budget film than its small $4.8 million budget. I had a lot of fun with this and will no doubt be watching this a few more times still. Well done!","

"Happy Death Day","HorrorFanatic4Life","2 March 2019","Saw the trailer when it first came out and thought it seemed like it had a unique take on reliving the same day twice. I was a huge fan of Edge of Tomorrow, but never have seen Groundhog Day (which this movie was inspired by so it says), so thought I'd give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised by how good this actually was. The two main characters Tree and Carter had perfect chemistry on-screen and Tree was unlike the typical sorority girl in horror movies (or any sorority movie for that matter) which was a great addition to it's already great story line. I actually had hope that her character would solve it and make it out alive - saying she was badass is an understatement!The movie does great at keeping you drawn in and constantly rethinking of who the killer might be with all the curveballs thrown in there. When the true killer was revealed, it was definitely unexpected and not hinted at once during the entire movie - that I caught onto anyways.This movie is a great mix of slasher-horror, mystery and comedy all in one and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great, fun movie. I can't honestly think of any part of it I didn't like.","

"Happy Death Day","EmmeCHammer","7 February 2019","I was cruzin through demand and found this little gem, wasn't expecting much but I am a horror/slasher genre fan so I make a point to watch every movie in this category regardless of good/bad reviews. I'm not a hip teenager anymore so I don't get the heads up on the in movies anymore and my kids are little young to fill me in on the new slasher/horror movies. So I made my popcorn and got my movie on(see what I did there) told you I wasn't hip anymore. The acting was pretty good, for this type movie and I definitely like the premise (Groundhog Day) but in a whole new light. Cliches galore but I wasn't expecting anything less, but was done very well and I was quite surprised and entertained which is all I can ask for in a movie. I think my low expectations had something to do with the 8* rating. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously which I think some reviewers do. If you like the teenage slasher/horror genre then there is no way you can honestly say you hate this movie, it's not groundbreaking, I made have rated a little high do to my expectations being low, but I like this a lot. And the lead actress (Tree) does a pretty believable job.","

"Happy Death Day","cricketbat","3 February 2021","Happy Death Day is a dark & silly movie. This film takes a stab at the time loop gimmick and has a fun time doing it. Jessica Rothe is able to bring some levity to both her character and the plot, but she also can play it serious when needed. Aside from some stumbles in the final act, I found this macabre comedy to be a cut above many other slasher flicks.","

"Happy Death Day","CinemaClown","7 July 2020","A fresh, funny & fiendish delight that's more than aware of its strengths & limitations and prefers to focus on its strong aspects instead of worrying about its weaknesses, Happy Death Day simply takes the unique concept of Groundhog Day and applies it to the slasher genre to offer a fun, thrilling & entertaining ride that's as wild & wicked as it is silly & amusing.Directed by Christopher Landon, while the premise of a college student reliving the day of her murder again n again keeps providing the thrills, it's the personal growth she undergoes over the course of the story that helps the viewers connect with her emotionally. Landon keeps the drama playful & lighthearted and even the repeated killings turn gleeful after a while.The plot follows the same format & established tropes of the slasher genre but with time-loop element in play this time around, the results come off as rather refreshing. It doesn't concern itself with the how n why of its central conceit but just embraces it & runs with it. Jessica Rothe's performance only gets better with time & she renders her character's fear, confusion, frustration, regret & evolution pretty well.Overall, Happy Death Day is a fascinating mix of horror & comedy that delivers the laughter as well as vicious killings in a consistently engaging fashion while keeping its genial & enjoyable tone alive n kicking for the most part. It may look eye-rollingly superficial from afar but there's plenty of heart underneath the surface that makes it a delicious treat that will please & satisfy both fans of the genre & casual filmgoers.","

Sometimes you need to get lost.I won't go too much into the story or give away any twists, etc. The characters are likable and the script is basic, but also doesn't take itself too seriously.

"Happy Death Day","Cineanalyst","18 February 2021","That's right, woodchuck-chuckers, it's ""Groundhog Day"" (1993)! Also, live, die, repeat, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014) and other entries before and since in the emerging time-loop genre. Not much new is done with this iteration, ""Happy Death Day,"" except to mix it with older, more-established genres. In this case, the slasher film and, to a lesser extent, a whodunnit murder mystery. The mystery is relatively poorly executed and none too interesting, but the construction works well enough as a violent horror flick. There's the usual, Michael Myers ripped-off masked madman, and the protagonist is the typical victim of a sexually-promiscuous sorority girl. Not quite the video game similarities of ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" or the mirrored psychologizing of ""Russian Doll,"" the shaggy-dog slacker ethos of ""Palm Springs"" (2020), let alone the cinematically-reflexive philosophical and religious musings offered by ""Groundhog Day.""As in all them, though, we get the romantic coupling. In this case, it's not well fleshed out--mostly serving merely for the repeated ""walk of shame."" The boy is poorly developed. Is he a nerd trope? A ""Scream"" (1996) type side-character who helps negotiate the protagonist's and, thus, our understanding of the situation? Or just a vestigial non-entity there because the filmmakers think every movie needs romance? (Having since seen the sequel, I think it's the latter.) The aforementioned three movies all do better to make their coupling integral to their scenarios, and ""Russian Doll"" actually avoids the cliché.Criticisms aside, I do enjoy even a half-baked time-travel plot, and it works well enough as coupled with the slasher genre. Much of the appeal of these movies, after all, is in the excess of the gore, both in the victimizing from the masked killer (who, as in the original ""Halloween"" (1978) represents the unseen film's spectator) and the victim's revenge against that unknown figure. Within and in its entirety, it's a formula repeated again and again with slight variations, with the spectator all the while being allowed to switch sides and get off scot-free.","

"Happy Death Day","The-Sarkologist","28 November 2020","After watching Freaky in the cinemas I discovered that the director had made other movies of a similar vein, namely slasher films with something of a twist. As such I decided that it might be a good idea to actually watch them, in particular this one. The main reason is that this film is sort of a cross between Groundhog Day and your typical slasher flick, with pretty much should tell you everything about this film.Anyway, Tree happens to be this girl who is a big shot on campus. She is fairly free wheeling, having an affair with one of her teachers, as well as numerous other guys. Anyway, she wakes up, to her horror, in a dorm room and does what she can to get out of it. It also happens to be her birthday, and they throw her a surprise party, except that she never arrives because, well, she is murdered on the way there - and wakes back up in the dorm room.It is sort of one of those mystery films where she is trying to figure out who the murderer is so that she can break out of the loop, and there does happen to be a few twists in it as well. In fact, one of the good things about this film is that there are multiple people dressing up as this rather creepy university mascot (that happens to be a one toothed baby) so you don't know who the murder is and, well, who just happens to be a person that has dressed up.It was billed as a comedy/slasher flick, but I can't necessarily say that it was hugely funny. Still, it was different, and one of the interesting things about this film is that everytime the loop happens, Tree gets weaker, which sort of ups the ante somewhat (which is certainly different from Groundhog Day, though I'm not sure how long he actually spent in that loop, though we do know how many days Tree was trapped - 11 days).It was good, and I must admit that I quite liked the twists as well. I also liked how the experience actually makes Tree a better person. The big reveal was a little odd though, but I won't actually say what it happens to be, namely because it is a bit of a spoiler (though if you watch the trailer for the sequel they sort of spill everything anyway). Yeah, I liked this film, it was different, and surprisingly entertaining as well.","

Relatively quick the film is handily split into what's essentially segments as we follow our protagonists investigation of her murder which until it's resolved occurs nightly. The editing and structure are brilliant and it's good to see the main character develop and find her feet around what's a mostly unlike able but completely fine cast, the resolution to the story is satisfying even if the twist is a little less so than what could've been. Still it's a good little film and another success for production company Blumhouse, worth a watch","

It is a good idea to already like the whole Ground Hog Day, Edge of Tomorrow type of movie, which is always a fun watch. The theme is getting to relive a day over and over again until you get it right. This is fun to watch but would probably be exhausting in real life. As we see our main character Tree (Jessica Rothe) trying to solve the mystery of her repeated death. She (Jessica Rothe) seems to be relatively new actress who does an exceptional job as the cute, smart and funny victim. It will draw you in and keep you thinking about it after.","

"Happy Death Day","Stevieboy666","7 October 2019","A female university student keeps getting murdered in her sleep, only to wake up to find that she is still alive. This keeps happening over and over so she must find a way of breaking the cycle and therefore save her life.
As others have stated this is Groundhog Day meets Scream. The idea behind this is fun but after the umpteenth time the novelty does start to wear a bit thin. What's more no explanation to this time loop is ever given. HDD is at least as much a romantic comedy as it is a horror movie. In fact die hard slasher fans will probably find this pretty tame, although the mask worn by the killer is very creepy. On the other hand those wanting a scary film but without the nastiness should find this very watchable. The production values are good, it is a well made film. Jessica Rothe plays the lead and her character is the backbone of this movie, my only criticism being that a 30 year old actress playing a part that is meant to be much younger isn't very convincing.
Overall a good fun movie with a few scares but I think many of these reviews are over generous. Doubtful I'd watch it again. Unless it's with a chick on a date!","

"Happy Death Day","jcosully","24 October 2018","I was pleasantly surprised by Happy Death Day. It had an interesting premise that wasn't undermined by its PG-13 rating restriction. The main element of this movies sucess was an great and possibly star making performance by Jessica Rothe. She portrays a mean girl with a sad backstory. This is usually a very cliche way to create characters, but she manages to make it unique. If she hadn't brought that factor to the movie, it could've been a lot, lot worse. The rest of the cast does a sufficient job, nothing amazing, but nothing that ruins the movie. Cliche people playing cliche roles. You have the rich, snotty and bratty girls, the nice guy, the creepy and suspicious roommate, the distant father and the handsome secret love interest. Some of these characters don't serve any purpose besides making the movie longer and making the main characters change more apparent. On another note, the plot is pretty interesting, but there are a couple spaces in the development in the characters and what is actually happening to Tree, and how it is happening. Maybe this will be explained in the sequel? I hope so. There wasn't too much gore in the movie, so if you're looking for a horror movie without blood, thus could be one of them. The kills are fine, but not really shown, because it wouldn't look realistic without blood, or the creators would have to add blood and change the rating to R. The movie itself isnt that scary, with a few jump scares. There are some scenes with good tension building, so at least that gives the film a slightly scary/creepy aspect. Finally, the ending isn't great. It doesn't answer that many questions, and is a bit unsatisfactory, as to who the killer is and how they did it. As or how the day keeps repeating itself, there is nothing to answer our connections. Again, hopefully they answer that question in the sequel.","

"Happy Death Day","frukuk","21 June 2020","This was just too monotonous a journey from start to finish, almost as if the screenwriter and director couldn't wait to get it over with.Until the last several minutes, this really felt like the killer had been unsubtly telegraphed: the shot of the guard at the hospital(?) and then the TV news report. Of course, that was a bit of blatant misdirection. It had me thinking, ""What was the killer's motivation for, apparently, explicitly targetting Tree?"" The answer, of course, is that the true killer did have some sort of motive, though I'm not convinced it was strong enough. (I may be confused, but I understood there to have been two actual killers, spread across the various re-runs of Tree's Death Day.)Despite that twist at the end, this just didn't offer enough to make it worth watching. It was an interesting idea, but the script didn't provide any real depth to the characters or situations. I remember The Butterfly Effect (2004) being a much more thoughtful and enjoyable imagining of ""do overs"" and their consequences.","

"Happy Death Day","stebird","23 January 2018","Once again the cash cow has been milked with this somewhat unoriginal love child of Groundhog Day, only with the added twist of murder.
Don't get me wrong ""Happy Death Day"" was a rather enjoyable film, you just can't help but think how uninspired Hollywood are becoming churning out yet another teen slasher and another reliving the same day over and over again film/plot. But for what it's worth this film actually worked, and the suspense was always there with the allure of who the baby-masked killer was and if she stops her murder from taking place, will it end the cycle of waking up on the same day over and over again, on her birthday no less. One of the high notes of ""Happy Death Day"" for me was the ending, or should I say the false ending, all is not as it seems and indeed there's more to the tale, where the false ending was predictable and poor, the real ending was a genuinely nice surprise, giving a tired old formula an extra lease of life, shall we say? The whole premise screamed modern day and young adult, and that's absolutely fine considering that that's the target audience; as well as the main subject of the film, the film also acted as a catalyst for showing the world a brief glimpse into modern college life.The acting was okay, nothing brilliant but certainly not poor, basically the standard you expect from a younger cast of actors..., but did they look sincere or could you tell that they were acting? Thing is a lot of younger talent these days always look a little wooden, so don't let that put you off. Altogether ""Happy Death Day"" is a decent, watch it because you've got nothing better to do film, just don't expect any high-ish standards.","

"Happy Death Day","fdbjr","14 October 2017","There is nothing terribly new in 'Happy Death Day', but it is a fun, cheerful (!) movie that almost everyone will enjoy. I noted 'spoiler' in the caption out of an abundance of caution, but my 'spoiler' is simply to note that there is surprisingly little overt violence in the movie - the heroine always blacks out at the moment before her death. What does happen, however, is the GroundHog Day formula, which is not so much about the repetitive days, as the transformation of the character - in this case, from a petulant, spoiled sorority girl into a decent, rather likable human being. She discovers her true love (the audience likes him from scene one), sees through the vapidity of her sorority sisters, and re-establishes a connection with her widower father. Not bad.Add to that a few plot twists that are logical and not all that predictable, and you have a fun two hours in the theatre. Not all that common these days.","

"Happy Death Day","gwnightscream","14 October 2017","This 2017 horror-thriller stars Jessica Rothe and Israel Broussard. This focuses on self-centered, college girl, Tree (Rothe) who starts reliving her birthday over again and is murdered each time by a masked killer. She tries to figure out the killer's identity and why she's being targeted. Broussard plays her new friend, Carter who helps her. This is a good horror/mystery flick with a bit of humor and Rothe is great in it. It obviously uses the formula of ""Groundhog Day"" and blends elements of ""Scream"" and other slasher flicks. Fans of the genre should check this out.","

"Happy Death Day","Braindead09","21 October 2017","When the Universal logo goes into a Groundhog Day/Edge of Tomorrow roll, its not hard to guess the plot of this film, especially when the loathsome leading character meets her demise within the first ten minutes, and then rewakes takes the audience onn her investigative journey as she gets to live the next 18 hours again.This results in a myriad of different days and scenarios reaching the same conclusion. No point in telling anyone how it ends, just go along with this amusing Christopher Landon film and you will enjoy it as much as his last screen outing the really good 'scouts guide to the zombie apocalypse'. The comedy horror genre has got itself a good talent long may his reign continue.The cast are good, the running gags work, the only disappointment is the lack of gore. The soundtrack selection offered my ear a load of tracks that I had not heard before, mind you I'm not the target audience for the soundtrack downloads.Worth a watch, just try to find a screening time where the phone obsessed and plastic wrap scrunching morons are not in attendance","

"Happy Death Day","chrismyers-87436","14 October 2017","After reading some of the reviewers trash this film, even though they didn't see it, I had to comment on this film. Also after reading glowing reviews for pretty awful films, IT and Blade Runner 2049, I needed to set the record straight. If you enjoyed Drag Me To Hell in a PG13 setting, you'll love Happy Death Day. Tree is a sorority girl, high fashion, snobby, and no carbs. She wakes up in some guy's dorm room, much to her dismay, only to realize she's reliving the day of her birthday and murder over and over again. Laughs, a few good scares, plot twists, and even a single tear (Yes, the acting is that good and Tree shows real growth) make this a fun escape in the magical world of the movies. This movie doesn't have much gore and only has sexual innuendos, which give the PG13 rating.THIS IS A FILM WORTH SEEING! CAMPY HORROR AT ITS BEST!","

"Happy Death Day","Lugo1989","16 November 2017","Happy Death Day is probably not going to become a cult classic of any sorts but if you like horror/comedy type of films you might like it. It starts of quite seriously and looks like it is taking the direction of a typical on college campus slasher. After a while it takes a nice turn and becomes much lighter and that is when some of the comedy elements kick in. It also had a few twists which was a nice surprise. You are not going to avoid any clichés by watching it since it has them all, good looking bitchy sorority girls, a handsome college professor with an English accent and a good-hearted shy kid.One thing I could not get out of my mind while watching it is how similar to Before I Fall it is. It is a drama/mystery also released this year and the premise is almost the same although Before I Fall feels more serious.Do not take Happy Death Day too seriously, relax and you should have fun watching it. I believe that was the main intention of everyone involved in making it.","

"Happy Death Day","Special-K88","25 March 2018","Snarky, self-centered college sorority girl (we all know the type) awakens on her birthday to find herself in a precarious predicament; but that's only the beginning as she's later murdered, then finds herself reliving the same day over and over again...with the same result over and over again. Her only solution is to try and track down the killer herself, but time is not on her side. Groundhog Day for the slasher genre, this has its fair share of clever moments as well as some shocking and laugh-out loud funny ones, but once the premise is revealed it becomes pretty obvious, and doesn't provide a very good or innovative climax given all the effort it makes to tell the story. A bit more unconventional than the usual films of this genre, thanks to a good (though derivative) setup. **","

"Happy Death Day","samtepalopenlesbian","14 October 2017","So, where to we start. This movie at first instance looks innovating and fresh, but the more forward it goes, the more bored you becomes. The plot looks kind of innovative, a groundhog day meets horror, but the groundhog day premise with different genre is done better with Edge of tomorrow. The comedy in this film is equally awful, and the scares aren't scary enough. It's like someone saw the cabin in the woods and made his own fan fiction with a more serious tone. The characters are blank and offers nothing new. Some of them are there for comic relief but they fail too. The only good thing about this movie is that its pacing is somewhat good, not too slow, not too fast, and also that the premise is not half bad. But in the fall, you should better watch blade runner 2049 or Jackie Chan's The foreigner. These two films deserve more attention than this piece of crap. Not like I am forcing you, but just giving an opinion.","

"Happy Death Day","slimer8489","23 October 2017","When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought it looked quite interesting. Sure, the Groundhog Day plot seems to be becoming a cliché nowadays (with movies like Before I Fall), and it was most likely going to be a jump-scare-infested film, since it came from Blumhouse, but I actually had interests in seeing this film, so I went and saw this with a friend.I thought the movie was okay, but nothing special. I liked the premise, I liked how the girl went from this unlikable bitch to an actual caring person as the film went on, and I liked how she gradually learned from the error of her ways. I also liked the design of the mask and how so many people had it in their possession, which only makes it harder to guess who the killer is.But no film is without its flaws.In some parts, it seemed like they were trying to go somewhere, like when the girl is spying on the people who she thinks might be out to kill her, but that was quickly dropped. The scene where she takes out that criminal was pretty good, but it then came off as pointless once the twist came. Oh, and speaking of that, while I did admire the twist and how they chose an unsuspecting person, the heroine jumped to the conclusion WAY too fast. Like, she just assumes all these things and it ends up being right. Like, you need to build up stuff like that. You can't just rush it.Overall, this movie was okay. It didn't rely too heavily on jump-scares, so I applaud them for that. Give it a watch if you want.","

"Happy Death Day","EthanBJones_03","28 October 2017","'HAPPY DEATH DAY' - 2017Directed by Christopher B Landon{Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse}Starring Jessica Rothe{La La Land} and Israel Broussard{Flipped}Plot Overview: ​When a young University student awakens in the dormitory of a complete stranger, she must move through her day until she inevitably gets killed off. The catch? She must relive this same fate ever day until she can stop the seemingly omnipotent and omnipresent killer.Going into this film, I expected a low rent slasher with a silly premise that I could write of a garbage. Well it certainly wasn't that. I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It's a very fun Halloween movie. Don't go into it expecting the next big thing in terms of horror, go in expecting a fun comedy with horror elements and I think that you'll enjoy this movie very much.What can I say that I liked about this movie, specifically? Well the tone was excellent. At the start, very few of the jokes hit for me so I got a little bit worried. But as the film progressed, it became a genuinely good comedy. I tend to like Horror-Comedies because I don't like the feeling of being scared, and thus a joke or two helps calm me down. The way they blend the two genres in this movie is almost effortless. It definitely leans a little more onto the comedy aspect than horror, which will definitely turn off those who EXPECTED this to be a horror movie. It's maybe a 1/4 horror movie, 3/4 comedy? The creepy and jumpy moments worked, but they were infrequent. With the exception of ONE, jump scares were also non existent in this movie. Thank the lord God for that! But to be fair, the one that they DO use was pretty effective and worked well. So as a whole, the tone for this movie was pretty darn excellent.Another aspect of this movie that absolutely deserves praise, is Jessica Rothe's performance as a Tree. Sorry, the character's name is Tree; the character is unfortunately not a tree. She is, actually, far from it. Most horror movies just substitute in a stereotype of a character and expect that to work but this movie doesn't. She's the pretty girl but she's also the deluded, sociopath. Seriously! At the start of this movie, the character Tree is about as likable as the plant one. But Rothe portrayed this character undeniably well. Even in the latter half of the movie, she portrays the character exceptionally well and really sells the character's growth.Another actor who appears in this movie was Israel Broussard. Broussard also gives an excellent performance as Carter. Not only that, but I also REALLY buy the romance between Tree and Carter. It doesn't feel forced in the slightest and that is rare for a movie nowadays. It usually feels wrong when two characters get together in a movie because I just cannot see it happening in real life. But thankfully, I did buy their relationship, and found it to be a very fun and goofy one to watch. Alas, I do definitely have some flaws with this movie. The final 15 minutes and the grand reveal were my two main issues. I won't spoil either of course, so you can still enjoy this film. But personally, I found the final 15 minutes of this movie to be COMPLETELY unnecessary. So much so that I was getting ready to leave at the climax of the scene before that because I thought the film was over. But no. They drag it on an extra 15 minutes and reveal what I predicted to happen. Which was my second issue. I predicted the ending BUT only because I was paying REALLY close attention to a scene and, while it may have bee accidental, they reveal the ending by use of a prop. This may be just me being smart and interpreting it a weird way, or it may have been intentional, in which case then well done to those who were in charge of that. It was a very clever way to reveal it, and the people I saw this film with didn't catch on and I had to tell them about it afterwards. Despite that, I did figure it out so I can't really credit the reveal as being that good.Something that personally didn't bother me but will bother other people, is the fact that this is not a horror movie by definition. It has elements of horror movies, yes. But it is still technically a comedy movie, which is NOT what the trailers suggested at all. So I can completely understand if horror fans felt mislead, therefore I do think that they should've either completely changed the marketing campaign OR included a LOT more horror elements and creepy scenes. But aside from those flaws, I found this to be a very enjoyable movie. It isn't going to win any awards but I can see it gaining a cult following. It was certainly fun and entertaining and I will definitely recommend you go and see it. I'll rate 'Happy Death Day' 6 'Creepy Masks' out of 10!","

"Happy Death Day","aidanratesmovies","30 January 2021","It's very entertaining on all fronts, and the actors do a good job of making it feel that way, as well as up and coming horror director Christopher Landon- however it certainly lacks the smarts and wit it has on other fronts in the writing department. Jessica Rothe provides a fun leading performance in this odd horror twist. The film largely plays out as if the film Scream and Groundhog Day had a baby- and it embraces that fact to the fullest. I enjoy Christopher Landon's direction throughout the film, it gives the energy it needed, and I honestly couldn't see the film being helmed by anyone else. However, the writing also impacts the film quite a bit. Between its generic opening, and predictable moments aside- the final twist just isn't as satisfying as the film makes it out to be. In fact, it can feel frustrating, as if writer Scott Lobdell wrote himself into a ditch. In the end, Happy Death Day was far better than I expected it to be, but it still could use some improvement on terms of how to write a more compelling, less generic, and more convincing storyline.
My Rating: 8/10","

"Happy Death Day","funnycommentor","11 July 2023","First of all, when I first watched the trailer of the movie I really enjoyed it, even though I didn't really had high expectations because I thought it was gonna be just a silly movie. The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and kinda innovative. The storyline was very well written, everything was well-explained and it was kinda original. The characters were very interesting, kinda well-developed and most of them were hilarious. The casting was really nice and their acting was good, each actor portrayed their character perfectly. It wasn't a very scary movie and most jumpscares were kinda predictable, however it was very intense and there were too many epic chase scenes. Also, the killcount of the movie wasn't bloody at all, but I really enjoyed every death scene because it was really brutal. In my opinion, that movie should be R-rated, instead of the PG-13 rating because it's a slasher movie and those kind of movies are meant to be BLOODY. The duration of the movie was perfect and the pacing of the movie was really fast, that's the reason why I enjoyed that movie. Moreover, the soundtrack was really good and the cinematography was excellent. The ending twist was definitely unexpected and it was kinda shocking, however it wasn't very well-explained. Overall, it was an enjoyable horror/comedy movie, action-filled, very funny and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.","

"Happy Death Day","aquascape","28 March 2018","Time loop movies always turn out to be fun and ""Happy Death Day"" made no exception to that rule.The movie is based around a college student who is murder by an unknown assailant, on her birthday nonetheless. After that she wakes up and relieves the same day over and over again, just like in ""Groundhog Day"", which of course was referenced in the movie, in a disappointing way to me with the main character not knowing what movie that was. 
The director left very subtle clues on who the killer might be and someone with an eye for horror/mystery films might catch on pretty early in the game.Some parts were funny, some parts were goofy and let's face it, it's pretty hard to make a good teen horror movie these days. 
The ending seems a bit carried away on how it was approached, missing small details, but if it's a comedic approach the movie was going for then it's fine.""Happy Death Day"" is a great addition to the slasher genre and to the time loop genre, being one of the best horrors of that year.","

In the title role, Jessica Rothe excels as a college student who, on the day of her murder, finds herself trapped in a time loop. The picture adeptly strikes a mix between mystery, comedy, and horror aspects, captivating viewers with its capricious plot and captivating performance by Rothe. The slasher formula gets a new lease on life thanks to Landon's direction, which presents an imaginative and fun interpretation of the genre. Happy Death Day is a fascinating and enjoyable addition to the horror-comedy genre, thanks to its deft writing, likable characters, and well-balanced humor and terror.","

"Happy Death Day","mt-95256","11 November 2017","TL;DRFully and shamelessly embraces similarity to Groundhog Day and uses that to its advantage, developing its own tone and personality - Disappointing in terms of horror – could have been stronger if they'd blended comedy and horror more - Very funny - A good twist towards the end - A very likable lead whose character believably develops more than you'd expect from a film like this——————————————————There comes a point in Groundhog Day where Bill Murray's Phil tires of his never-ending, repetitive day and starts deliberately trying to kill himself. Happy Death Day, on the other hand, while maintaining the same premise, sees the protagonist not running towards death, but running away from death again and again and again – each time she gets killed resulting in her day restarting. Though initially seeming like an interesting blend of comedy and horror, the horror is much more lite than expected, but the entertaining film is saved by the well-done comedy and the eventually very likable lead – definitely more than I was expecting (always a good thing for horror movies!)It sounds like much more of a horror/thriller than it really is. It could have been an excellent achievement, perfectly blending the horror/thriller and comedy genres; instead though the focus is much more on comedy than any kind of scares or suspense. Still, this doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film. There are plenty of examples of films blending horror and comedy (Scream, the easiest example), but it's a shame that there wasn't enough emphasis on horror for it to be included in lists among greats like Scream. Instead the promotion sold it more as a horror film, inevitably disappointing the more avid horror fans. There are enough scary movie clichés and a couple of jump scares peppered throughout to satisfy most, though it's far from being able to call itself a true horror. Yet maybe you'd get away with labelling its secondary genre as 'thriller;' it's here that this film has an edge on Groundhog Day (I know, sacrilegious comment!). Happy Death Day matches Groundhog Day with comedy, but surpasses it by including a more unique whodunit plot. It's hugely enjoyable watching Tree go through her suspects and theories, ticking off her list as well as your own. Plus the twist at the end (one you absolutely do not see coming) makes it all worth it too.This isn't to say though that Happy Death Day is perfect; awards are hardly going to come by their way and there are plenty of examples of overly clichéd and cheesy lines but they're well aware of this and they play it as a strength. Director Christopher Landon is absolutely self-aware and uses all manner of horror genre clichés and cheesy lines to add to the personality, keeping it fun, quirky and, most importantly, very enjoyable. This is best seen right at the very end where one character actually compares it all to Groundhog Day, which Tree, comically, hasn't seen and isn't even aware of. It's a wonderful satire of Hollywood, tired of ideas and just copying what's come before, repackaging it and feigning ignorance, pretending it's totally original. They certainly didn't mention it for a similar film with a repetitive day, Edge of Tomorrow.A lot of how much we enjoy it though isn't just the writing, but down to the cast, specifically the leading-lady. The supporting cast are all good, particularly bitchy sorority sister Rachel Matthews and sweet and innocent male love interest Israel Broussard. But the one who really excels here is Jessica Rothe, absolutely deserving of a leading role since her only really high profile role so far has been as Emma Stone's flatmate in La La Land (she played Alexis by the way – something only hardcore fans of the musical would even have a chance of knowing). Happy Death Day is much more a showcase for her talents, showing she can do more than just sing and dance, but can carry a horror-comedy almost totally single-handedly, showing particular attention to character growth and development (something often overlooked in many films nowadays). Her character is the polar opposite to Bill Murray's counterpart in Groundhog Day; yes, he's miserable a lot of the time, but still very likable. For the first part of Happy Death Day, however, Tree is utterly unlikeable; a rude, irredeemable character we dislike despite her looks; but this opinion quickly changes once the film finds its feet and gets going. Each bad quality she seems to have slowly and believable changes as she understands her situation and tries to change it, becoming self-aware. In a Dickensian manner (a la A Christmas Carol) we quickly fall for Tree and like her very much as she changes to a very charming, quirky and lovable lead character. Props to the writing from Scott Lobdell too, but this is totally down to Rothe who makes the film the joy it is.It's impossible to take this film too seriously and to ignore comparisons to Groundhog Day; but you might as well because this is a still a different enough film to not feel like a repetitive rehash (ironically). It's a shame that it doesn't live up to it's horror promotion and shies away from its premise of marrying humour and horror since this could have really strengthened the film and made it more memorable. Nevertheless, this doesn't at all hamper any enjoyment of Happy Death Day because it's a very fun one; a bit of horror here, a lot of laughs there, lots of fun throughout with a charismatic, lovable lead. Halloween has never been happier.","

What is up with Teen Mom?Director Christopher Landon, perhaps mostly known for being the screenwriter of Disturbia, Paranormal Activity 2, Paranormal Activity 3, Paranormal Activity 4, and Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, has achieved something strange with Happy Death Day. It rehashes the gimmick of Groundhog Day as an introspective commentary on snobbery, apathy, vanity, and almost sympathy. It also throws in a psychological whodunit with only a couple of unsatisfying twists, some decent laughs, and surprisingly good acting from a star- bedazzled-less cast of B- and C-listers, all of whom have a sense of self-awareness that this is not a great movie, but at least they had fun along the way.I kept wondering, though, why not buy a gun? Why not leave town? Why not spend all night on the floor of a casino, where you will be surrounded by amped-up gamblers making murder more unlikely?If you were stuck on a deserted island and had to watch only one movie, every day for eternity, would you prefer Groundhog Day or Happy Death Day? It's a closer call than you might initially think.If you were stuck on Dessert Island, would you choose Bananas Foster, Cherries Jubilee, Baked Alaska, or Strawberries Romanoff? I bet you didn't even know about Strawberries Romanoff until now.","

"Happy Death Day","killercharm","29 April 2022","Delightful story about an uppity sorority sister reliving the day of her murder, which is her birthday, over and over again until she figures out the answer to life the universe and everything. Not only does this flick have great scares, but it's funny. Jessica Rothe's emotional slide into the Groundhog Day pool is wondrous. Each morning she wakes up to the same day with a little less ability to cope until she wakes up screaming. That blows the boozy cobwebs out the brain and she gets down to figuring things out between each murder.","

"Happy Death Day","ethanbresnett","31 March 2021","Happy Death Day is one of those films that punches well above its weight, and is far greater than the sum of its parts.It blends comedy, horror (pretty light touch horror in truth), teen drama, and does so brilliantly in my opinion.They use the groundhog day repetition of the events to great effect, drawing out lots of comedic potential, but also using this to develop and explore the central character of Tree in interesting ways. There's some great dramatic and emotional moments and I found myself getting very invested with the character.If you are a horror fan I'd maybe temper your expectations a bit going into this film. There are a few moments of genuine suspense and a couple of jump scares, but I'd say the film leans away from horror and more towards the comedy side for the most part. I enjoyed that they went down this route, as since we know she is going to die each time there's only so much horror they can really inject.Overall a really fun film. It perhaps lacked decent supporting characters and was a bit cliche in parts, with occasionally clunky dialogue, but none of this stopped me having a great time with this film.A really enjoyable movie!","

"Happy Death Day","pedroquintaoo","12 October 2017","Since Happy Death Day was announced, seemed to be a mix between Scream (1996) and Groundhog Day (1993), a story about a sorority girl getting killed and needing to repeat her day again, again and again was a really nice concept. However my expectations went low when the movie was rated PG-13. I mean how is possible to do a good slasher without blood and violence?This movie has a good plot, the characters are really nice, I was interested in all of them and trying to guess who was the killer since the movie started. Sometimes tries to break the usual horror movie clichés and that's amazing. There are a lot of funny moments (some jokes are a little naughty for a PG-13 film, but still great). In my opinion the biggest problem is the lack of violence because some death scenes would be so amazing and funnier if the producers decided to add some blood and gore (like some Final Destination's deaths), however the worst problem is when Happy Death Day tries too hard to be different and surprise the viewer with some revelations that don't make sense.SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT That's one of the worst plot twists I've seen in a horror movie. Near of the 3rd act, Tree Gelbman figures out the killer is a random serial killer that just likes to kill young girls, it doesn't make sense, because how it's possible that guy know some secrets about the protagonist? Then we figure out the real killer is just an annoying girl from the sorority, she used the serial killer to put an ending in Tree's life. When the main character asks why she's doing this the villain just gives an explanation like ""you have an affair with the guy that I love"". For me that was awful and really confusing in someway.I would prefer a plot twist where we had 2 killers working together, Tree figuring out his identity, surviving and thinking that wouldn't die and repeat the same day again, but she's surprised by another killer and figures out there are 2 killers and not just one. They could be just 2 ""friends"" of her giving the explanation they hated her in due of the bad things she used to do to everybody. ENDING OF THE SPOILERS - ENDING OF THE SPOILERS - ENDING OF THE SPOILERSHappy Death Day tries to be different and it's in someway, however is also a victim of its own mistakes as the PG- 13 rating and the confused and weak plot twist. In my opinion is a good option for this Halloween, because at least is fresh and really funny.Rating: 6.5/10","

"Happy Death Day","AngelHonesty","3 February 2020","Not bad. I wasn't too sure what to expect, most newer horror films are full of blood and gore, but this one was surprisingly tame. The movie has a mix of Groundhog day, scream and American Pie all put together, making a nice combination of funny and scary. The film isn't deep or terrifying as it's about cliché collage drama mixed in with a little murder, which in turn sets a fun and light mood to the movie. The character development was interesting and the ending was unexpected as you are constantly trying to guess who the murderer is.","

"Happy Death Day","RetroRick","27 January 2018","Given its current rating - 6.5 at the time of writing - , it's identity as a college slasher flick, and notwithstanding the genre transplant, it's fundamentally derivative nature in its reworking of groundhog day, I didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I did.I can think of at least one other film based loosely based on ground hog day (I'm sure there have been many since even that I believe was based on the Ouspensky story ""a strange day in the life of Ivan Osokin"", and of course has even older origins in the myth of Sisyphus / cyclical ideas of history / psychological theories of arrested development etc. The film I'm thinking of, the name of which escapes me, but came out only a few years back, was written as a horror rather than a who-dunnit as I recall, but the one thing I do recall about it was after a while I began really did start to feel as existentially depressed as the nature of the experience might itself might predict. In other words, as the story itself suggests, the relief from monotony, repetition and ultimately deja vu, depends on the freshness of execution, deftness, and not just the idea, or splicing of ideas in this case, itself. Happy Death Day, despite the corny title, actually executes its ideas quite brilliantly, and there was never a time I was actually bored or felt as though the scenes in the film were literally repeating.I've given it a generous rating because I genuinely found myself concerned about the character - Jessica Roth's Tree, and - unlike some other reviews I'm afraid, failing to predict where the film would go. There are some predictable elements, like the Bill Murray like character progression, but these complement the story, and oddly serve to lull the viewer into a false sense of security.I won't go overboard. This isn't the best mystery, or who-dunnit, you've seen. The solution seemed pretty good to me, but clearly not everyone felt that way, but in the end it works really well, and in my view largely manages to transcend its genre. B++","

"Happy Death Day","invisibleunicornninja","13 March 2018","Plot - The longer you watch this movie, the more things you will notice make no sense. Don't worry though, pretty much everything is explained nicely in the finale. Except how the main character kept reliving the same day over and over, but to be fair, they never explained that in Groundhog Day either and any explanation for that would be pretty stupid. The Scare Factor - I think that this was supposed to be a horror movie, but its not scary at all. The blood effects may be good, but the acting is not. I was laughing so hard I think I annoyed some of the other movie theater patrons (I saw this in theaters). This film is what you might refer to as an ""unintentional comedy"" as whenever its trying to be scary or dramatic, its actually funny. The Characters - Most of the characters are dumb and underdeveloped. The main character is extremely unlikable, but that just makes it funnier. A lot of the characters are obnoxious American teenage girls, and the bad acting just makes them so much more believable and obnoxious. Some of the stupidity can get very infuriating after a while though. Sights and Sounds - The soundtrack isn't fantastic, but its decent. The sound design is overall ok. This movie has a pretty cheap vibe to it, but effort was made to make this movie look good. If you pay attention, some of the editing and the effects are pretty well done. Its not perfect, but there was clearly effort put into the presentation of this low-budget movie. Overall this movie isn't the greatest thing ever, but its fun. This movie is funny, and entertainment is to be had here. My number score mainly reflects how much fun I had watching it and not the overall quality of this movie. I would recommend this movie, but its not for everyone. You'll either find this funny, or annoying.","

Jessica Rothe as Tree Gelbman and Israel Broussard as Carter Davis are fantastic as the two leads. They have excellent chemistry and make us root for them.The script is smart, there's horror, there's comedy, there's drama. Happy Death Day takes you in numerous directions, while also making sure you have fun along the way. It even pokes fun at Groundhog Day, which it very clearly took some inspiration from.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror; again, it doesn't redefine the genre and there are definitely an abundance of clichés.

"Happy Death Day","MonsterVision99","6 November 2017","Yet another teenage horror comedy, this one its much more lacking in the horror department than I was expecting it to be, it has a few decent suspenseful scenes and some slightly funny moments but its mostly just uninteresting, predictable, dull and obnoxious.This feels like a made for TV Lifetime movie that went to theaters, its kind of like ""Scream"" in many aspects they are both annoying, they are both dumb, and they are both rather decent when it comes to the actual horror scenes. The main lead is a brat, really unlikable, even when she gets done with her character arc she remains somewhat irritating, Bill Murray could get away with saying douchy lines and still being likable, he was known for that, we rooted for him in ""Groundhog Day"" because we wanted him to be a better person and to be happy, the girl in this movie is decent at delivering the lines but you never feel like she could be a nice person.While the comedy in movies like this its often hit or miss, I will say its mostly miss here by having characters say predictable lines or being exasperating just for the sake of it.The director is Christopher B. Landon, who wrote many ""Paranormal Activity"" movies and directed ""The Marked Ones"" after that he went into teenage horror comedies with ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"", looks like he couldn't make a decent horror movie so he decided to ""make fun of them"" with these awkward juvenile movies like ""Happy Death Day.""","

"Happy Death Day","thekarmicnomad","14 January 2018","No two ways about it this is Scream meets Groundhog Day.Plot wise there is not much more i can say without spoiling but I think there is enough to go around.The production on this movie is very slick and lavish.A lot of weight falls on the lead and she does an excellent job.A lot of negative reviews seem to take issue with how unlikable the main character is.
This is obviously by design, and necessary for this type of movie.
What would be the point of watching Ground Hog Day if Bill Murray was an absolute delight from scene one?The gore and horror elements are quite light making this a very easy watch.
The plot is fairly sturdy, but if you are inclined to sit there and pull at strings then this will unravel and perhaps sci-fi/slasher movies are not for you.This won't give you nightmares or strain your brain too much but is a very enjoyable, fun romp.","

"Happy Death Day","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","10 September 2020","Wow, there has certainly been a deluge of time-loop stories lately, hasn't there? From quickly forgotten films like ""Before I Fall,"" to quirky mainstream comedies like ""Palm Springs,"" to popular television series like ""Russian Doll,"" audiences can't seem to get enough of these types of projects. And possibly the best of the trend is 2017's delightfully twisted and wonderfully hammy horror-comedy ""Happy Death Day!""Jessica Rothe stars as ""Tree,"" a troubled and sometimes selfish sorority girl who gets her kicks from things like ignoring others and having illicit affairs with her college professors. But things quickly change when she is murdered one night by a masked assailant... only to wake up and relive the same day over again... and then die yet again at the hands of the masked figure. With the help of a charming fellow student named Carter (Israel Broussard), Tree is able to surmise that she is stuck inside of a time-loop, destined to relive the day again and again until she can solve the mystery of her own murder and keep herself alive. And along the way, she'll also learn to confront her inner demons and maybe become a better person for it.Directed by Christopher Landon from a script by Scott Lobdell, ""Happy Death Day"" works extremely well thanks to the wonderful cast, a good blend of humor and thrills that make the most out of the time-loop gimmick, and some top-notch character development. It's a resounding success all around, and is arguably one of the best horror-comedies in recent memory.I absolutely adore the cast. Rothe, a relative newcomer, knocks it out of the park as our lead. I've only seen her once or twice in the past, but she absolutely commands the film. She gives Tree a good sense of depth, and is also just as entertaining as you could want her to be. Absolutely fabulous performance. Broussard is endlessly likable as Tree's main ally in the film, and potential romantic interest Carter. He helps ground the movie, and is a lot of fun in his part. I also absolutely loved Rachel Matthews as the school's resident queen-bee mean-girl Danielle. It's a small part, but Matthews makes quite the impression. And of course there's a small turn from Ruby Modine as Tree's long-suffering roommate Lori. She's quite good in the film and has some juicy scenes to sink her teeth into.The film's execution is also top-notch stuff. Lobdell's script skillfully mixes classic slasher-film scares with a keen sense of humor, creating a pretty ideal blend that keeps the audience at the edge of their seats while also piling on the laughs. The script also makes the most of the time-loop narrative in clever and subversive ways. There are so many fun little moments showing Tree's journey, and her just... having fun with the fact she keeps reliving the same day over and over again. And director Landon's execution of the material is pitch perfect. I've been a fan of Landon for a while now thanks to his other projects, and he's just the right fit. His sense of pacing and composition is fantastic, and he's able to execute the laughs and the thrills to perfection. In a lot of ways, he very pleasantly reminded me of early Sam Raimi in how he handles the material. And that's a very good thing.And then there's the character development, which is really the beating heart of the film. In a lot of ways, Tree's growth is more important than the story. And it is just perfect. The film does a remarkably good job at establishing Tree as a very flawed and often unlikable person at the start... but then cleverly begins to dole out little bits of information suggesting it's not really her fault, and that she has a lot of pain beneath the surface. And the story goes on, Tree eventually begins to reevaluate her life in pretty fantastic ways. It may be a bit simplistic at times, but I really appreciate it when a movie is able to take us on a journey like this. Especially a horror film, which don't always have the best track records when it comes to character development.If I absolutely had to point out any weaknesses to the film, I would say that the story perhaps takes a little too long to get going. The first few days in the time-loop can kinda drag a bit. A little tightening to ""trim the fat"" would have been appreciated. I also do think some of the twists and turns are a little... ""convenient."" But then again, the film is so much fun, I can forgive that for the most part.I absolutely adore ""Happy Death Day."" It takes a simple premise-- ""What if 'Groundhog Day' was a slasher movie?""-- and spins it into pure gold. It's arguably the best ""time loop"" story in recent memory, and it's just a blast-and-a-half to watch. I'm giving it a very good 8 out of 10. Definitely worth seeing.... again and again.","

"Happy Death Day","hnt_dnl","16 February 2024","HAPPY DEATH DAY (2017) is an anomaly of a modern film for me because the actual film turned out to be just as good as the trailer! Maybe even better. I've seen a lot of movies where the trailer was good/great and the actual movie was awful. Happy Death Day is a horror-comedy (or comedy-horror if you prefer) centering around Tree Gelbman (superbly played by Jessica Rothe). Tree is a haughty sorority girl on a college campus and the movie begins with her waking up with a hangover on her birthday in the dorm room belonging to Carter Davis (excellently played by Israel Broussard). In these early scenes, we see that Tree is a real piece of work! Lol The writing lays it on thick that Tree is extremely vain and unlikable, but it works mostly due to Rothe's persuasive acting and her exceptional acting continues throughout the film as Tree progresses into a better human being as she is forced to re-live her birthday (and death day) many times until she finds out the identity of her killer. The movie tackles Groundhog Day with nonstop humor, twists, and turns and a winning supporting cast. In addition to Tree and Carter, there's Lori (Tree's roommate), Ryan (Carter's roommate), Gregory (Tree's very married professor and also her lover), Mr. Gelbman (Tree's father), and last but certainly not least scene-stealer Danielle (brilliantly played by Rachel Matthews). A huge bonus for me in this film is that I had virtually never seen any of these actors in anything before and also their performances felt so natural, it was like watching actual people in the context of a well-told story.Rothe was a revelation as Tree, carrying this hilarious and at times heartwarming film on her back for it's entirety. And Rothe and Broussard had genuine chemistry as Tree and Carter that was methodically built up throughout the movie. And have to re-iterate how hilarious Matthews was as the vapid head sorority girl Danielle. One of the funniest performances I've seen in ANY film in recent years. In fact, this is a movie where the likable cast was even better than the script, which itself was pretty good. It got to a point where I was liking the characters so much I almost didn't care about the plot, which itself turned out to have a really clever twist. Happy Death Day is one of the best and most refreshing additions to the horror genre in recent years.","

"Happy Death Day","VenturousArtist","14 December 2017","Throughout this particular time-loop horror film, there's many instances where great potential is uncovered but either underwhelming, disjointed, or underutilized. Primarily the incoherency comes from its style of writing and scenery with characters and subplots. Although some creativity is presented, there's never enough explored or justified to enhance the messy experience.However, despite some major setbacks, there's some elements that could be appealing in terms of comedy, drama, romance, and horror. Unfortunately, for some viewers, these and other elements may either appear incomplete, irrational, or outright unsatisfying. There's many characters but few are given enough time to perform to their fullest to benefit their existence including unexpected outcomes for questionable consequences.Many opportunities and ideas, with the great performances, are missed many times to the extent that gradually alters the experience. For some, these could be easily ignored and accepted for their worth. But for others, these are weirdly written and directed concepts that deserved a greater vision in better care. It delivers what the premise promises but not strongly as it could.It's a middling birthday party for the middling demographic.","

"Happy Death Day","imdb-936-837144","16 October 2017","Bayfield U. co-ed Theresa (Tree) Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) is having a bad day in Louisiana. She's living her birthday over and over again à la ""Groundhog Day"" in which Bill Murry played a Pittsburgh weather­man whose holiday gig repeated itself every day—only hers has a more tragic ending. She shares the same birth­day with her deceased mom; they used to celebrate it together. We wonder if anyone else shares her Monday the 18th celebration.The U.S. Constitution was signed on Sept. 17, 1787. Since in 2017 the 17th is on a Sunday, Constitution Day is celebrated on the 18th. At least we'd be comparing apples to apples, two designated holidays. But what has Constitution Day got to do with Groundhog Day?In John Trotwood Moore's circa 1897 story, ""First Monday in Tennessee"", he relates ""the origin of First Monday in April, a day now entirely devoted to the display of livestock, was a kind of feast day in the temple of Ground-Hogium, celebrated in honor of the termination of the Ground-Hog's potent prophecy."" People rode their horses to town after the six weeks of extended winter was over. ""The custom was gradually changed from Ground-Hog worship to horse swapping."" He relates the festivities: ""the pikes are fairly alive with folks, peoples, horses, jacks and nigg'rs.  that is the order in which they stand socially in Tennessee.  when 'all hands' have reached the classic town of Columbia, for instance, their first duty is to repair to the nearest bar for a drink.  When a portly gentle­­man of the first class walks in, his face shining behind a silver grey mustache,  the best in the house is set up. He's folks. But when one of the other class walks in, the bar­keeper peeps over the counter to observe his foot­gear. If he has on shoes and stockings, the bar­keeper knows his purse will stand Lincoln County's Medium; if he has on shoes but no stockings, apple brandy from the county of Warren  is set out; but if, in looking over the counter, the bar­keeper's eyes meet the sprawling flabbiness of two po'white feet, bust-head at five cents a glass is what he wants. In no case is any question asked except, 'How are you shod, partner?'""In ""Death Day"" Tree wakes up to put on her best evening dress high heels, sans stockings. She goes to a good school but the students are hardly academics, being given over to partying and hookups: strictly middle class. Her daddy, though, is shown doing some fine dining at a fancy restaurant, where a colored waitress serves the tables. Tree's sorority had a prejudice against ""chocolate milk."" Tree's mom had an endearing ""horse laugh."" Tree did a ""Lady Godiva"" number sans horse. Those were social liabilities. And at least one jack­ass in the dorm deserved a swat on the ass. Discriminations are rife in this place, which Martin Luther King Jr., who now has his own MLK Day immediately preceding Ground­hog Day, would have been dead set against.Schools receiving federal funds are mandated to teach about the Constitution on Constitution Day. Here there's a girl soliciting signatures against man-made global warming; she's taken as seriously as the water sprinklers, false car alarm, and stand-till-you-drop stunt, which all follow natural cycles. The homo­sexual who tries to go straight is not helped either. These are nonstarters here.If we want traction, we need to consider a Mormon sermon set down in Owen Wister's 1895 short story, ""A Pilgrim on the Gila"": ""Don't empty your swill in the door-yard, but feed it to your hogs.  Rotten meat, rotten corn, spoiled milk, the truck that the thought­less folks throw away, should be used. Their usefulness has not ceased because they're rotten.  nothing is meant to be wasted in this world.  Waste it by the threshold it becomes deadly, and a curse."" The food tray spilled by the dining sorority was not cleaned up right away, and Tree tosses her uneaten cupcake in her dorm room's open trash can. Festering food can be deadly. ""That sagacious patriarch told his flock the things of week-day wisdom down to their level, the cleanly things next to godliness."" To complete the cleanliness with godliness dyad, there's also a lesson against committing adultery, sleeping with one's professor to skate with good grades.These were the two things the Christian community held against MLK: he marched without a parade permit, spewing trash that the city was not prepared to clean up, and he was a well-known womanizer. But by the time Constitution Day rolls around, MLK Day is already forgotten. Relating it to Goundhog Day makes it still relevant.Article IV, Section 2, ¶ 3 of the US Constitution mandates the return of escaped slaves to their owner even from free states if need be. This was obviated by the 13th Amendment that abolished slavery. However, ratification required ¾ of the states' approval, and some southern states were occupied until they consented, making that approval non-voluntary. If MLK could be considered still subject to slavery—he was, after all, highly worried—, then his birthday replacing halves of both Llincoln's & Washington's would place him in the position of: (Prov. 30: 21-22) ""the earth is disquieted,  and cannot bear: for a servant when he reigneth."" Having the days out of whack would qualify for this disruption. Q.E.D.When Tree's friend Carter (Israel Broussard) turns to help her, we see her in good hands, Carter having been the last president before Reagan instituted MLK Day.I loved ""Groundhog Day"", having seen it 13 times on the big screen. I saw ""Happy Death Day"" on Friday the 13th, in House 13 of the multiplex. The number 13 was not wasted on this movie. The acting was all adequate to the plot. It incorporated the best of ""Groundhog Day"" while not being entirely redundant. It has my hearty recommendation.",NA
"Happy Death Day","Paurian","16 July 2022","The humor, wit, clever twists and thrills made this an instant favorite!

"Happy Death Day","Aktham_Tashtush","6 January 2018","The movie delivered ,, the plot was so strongly built even though the idea is not that original and 40 movies (yes i checked :D ) had the same idea of repeating the same day over and over again 5 of them this year , But this one had it's own taste fresh-style as it had mystery, horror and comedy all blended together.The perfect element in here was the writing ,, it was exciting and no gabs , maybe started just a little slow but just after 15 minutes the events went on a rabid finger flicks and at some point they make you suspect everyone even those who are unlikely to be the murderers.The cast was good,, all engaged well and gave a nice performance ,, they all look new faces to me ,, i don't know if this was a low-budget movie (i absolutely don't think it is) but if it was me i would have casted at least one familiar face to give the movie a bit of popularity and name on the movie theaters,, but again the whole cast was really good.The Last scene just made my eyes gouge ,, but it was really fun way to show they had a sprinkle of comedy that changed to consistency of the movie.Final thought,, go watch it, it's worth paying your 14 bucks ;)",NA

I have never written a movie review before nor have I wanted to but for 'Happy death day' I had to make an exception. From opening sequence to the end credits, this film was incredibly bad. After seeing it, I wanted a refund and questioned whether I should ever watch a movie again. I am a regular movie goer and so can appreciate just how terrible this really is. There was not one single redemable quality the movie showed me why some people choose to end their own lives. From the cringey awful casting and dialogue, to the tired and predictable ending, this is hands down the worst thing I've seen since concentration camps.

"Escape Room","rustonreviews","9 February 2019","Drawing influences from Saw (2004), Final Destination (2000), and Cube (1997), Escape Room follows six individuals, all of whom receive a puzzle box prescribing a cryptic note inviting them to the Minos Escape Room Facility. Lured to the facility under the promise of receiving a cash prize of ten thousand dollars, these six strangers must endure several intricately designed puzzle rooms in a thrilling game of life or death. While the premise doesn't exactly scream originality, Escape Room is a perfectly enjoyable little thriller. For those expecting buckets of gore and sickening death scenes, look elsewhere, as Schut and Melnik's screenplay is much more attuned to focusing on the elaborate puzzles themselves, resulting in a film that intrigues rather than disturbs. Pace wise, the film doesn't slow down and is engaging throughout, some of the puzzle rooms are quite visually arresting, and thankfully the characters aren't just one dimensional zeroes either. While the ending does border on nonsensical, Escape Room is a still a fun film that is definitely worth checking out.","

We see flashbacks that they were all involved in some life threatening event where they may or could had perished.Escape Room in its own term is better than a lot of low budget horror/thrillers.

"Escape Room","CronenbergsMonster","12 August 2020","Dont believe the 10/10 or the 1/10 reviews. This movie falls almost squarely in the middle. The premise is essentially a PG-13 Saw movie with multiple puzzle rooms for the protagonists to escape (rather than torture devices). There are some really great set pieces, tense moments, and decent acting throughout. However, the film completely falls apart in the last act. Its clearly meant to be setup for a franchise, which completely belittles everything in the first 3/4 of the film and ruins all the goodwill established up to that point. This could have been a really competent thriller if it werent for the money-grabbing shill of an ending. As it stands, this is basically a sub-par ""Cube."" 5/10 for me; I cant fully recommend it.","

"Escape Room","Leofwine_draca","3 February 2020","ESCAPE ROOM is a generic kind of thriller that trades on the newfound popularity of thriller experiences, in which a group of friends willingly allow themselves to be locked in escape rooms before solving puzzles to facilitate their escape. A real-life CRYSTAL MAZE, if you will. I've seen a previous and very similar B-movie that wasn't very good, but this one is more mainstream and bigger budgeted, so there's more emphasis on effects. I found it quite similar to that '90s cult classic CUBE, although of course nowhere near as good, lacking as it does interesting characters and only tending to generate a minimum of suspense despite all the screaming and shouting.","

"Escape Room","SnoopyStyle","3 September 2019","Six strangers are given mystery boxes that invite them to win $10k. Each one arrive at an office building. As they wait in a room, they find the door locked with the heat rising. They struggle to escape and find themselves trapped in a series of elaborate rooms.This reminds me of Cube. At least in that one, the movie doesn't waste time introducing the characters. The opening foreshadowing sequence reveals almost everything. I kept waiting for a surprise reveal that the other competitors were not actually killed. Maybe they deliberately did not show a irrevocable death on screen to highlight a red herring. I don't care about these people. They are annoying. Everybody has a rude comment or a sly joke. The group dynamics could work with one jerk but almost everybody seems to have a jerk mode. They need to chill. As for the room designs, they are the most appealing aspect of the movie. They are fascinating although the clues are basically random. In Cube, there is actually something to solve. In this one, there isn't much to solve. I also hate that the players don't try to bring useful items from one room to another. It's rather unrealistic that everybody walks out of the cabin into the woods without grabbing a blanket or rug. At the very least, someone would brace the door open. The room designs are inventive and pretty fun. That keeps my interest until the end.","

"Escape Room","cruise01","5 January 2019","Escape Room (4 out of 5 stars).Escape Room is a twisted and fun thriller film that lacks the originality of the concept since there are films like Saw, The Collector, and The Belko Experiment. But the film does not stop you from being entertained with a thrilling direction that does keep you on the edge of your seat and plays around with the concept of characters going through several escape rooms and puzzle solving. If they fail to solve in time or escape, there are some deadly consequences.The plot follows several characters Zoey (Taylor Russell), Ben (Logan Miller), Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll), Mike (Tyler Labine), Jason (Jay Ellis), and Danny (Nik Dodani) all getting an invitation puzzle box that invites them to an escape room experience. If they get out, they will win 10,000 dollars. Right when they go to the destination and waiting in the first room. That is were the games begin. They will have to use their knowledge and problem solving to get through each room before they fall for the trap. With each room and puzzle solving involving a secret of their past. They figure out there is something bigger going on than just an escape room game.The plot was good. It may not be fresh of an original idea. But it was entertaining to see several strangers trying to figure out the clues and survive. Each character has their own backstory of a tragic past that lead them to this game. Each character all has their own distinct personality on how they try to survive. Zoey is a sweet, intelligent college student. Ben is an alcoholic and a dead beat teenager. Amanda was in the military. Mike is a truck driver. Jason is a financing businessman with a selfish attitude. Danny is the geeky teenager who is obsessed with problem solving. But how are all these characters connected? Or what they have in common? The build up with the plot was good. As they go from one deadly room to another. From a room that is firing up in high temperatures to a frozen lake that is breaking apart to an upside down bar and a white static sound room that may not be for the sensitive audience that can not handle flashy dizzying lights.Taylor Russell was good playing her character that is pushed to her limits as she progressed through the games. Logan Miller, Deborah Ann Woll, Tyler Labine, Jay Ellis, and Nik Dodani were all good with their characters.Director Adam Robitel did well in building the suspense and thrills. As characters are facing danger in every room. The direction did well in making you feel claustrophobic or fear of falling from an upside down room. The opening scene with a character being crushed from a room with walls closing in does set the momentum of the suspenseful direction. The music score Brian Tyler and John Carey also helped creating the tone with each room.I did feel like the twist was a bit far fetched with the last ten minutes of the movie. Without giving away spoilers about the idea of the escape rooms and the ending. Yes, it does leave room for a sequel. I was disappointed and the twist did not leave that surprising shock feeling at all.Overall, Escape Room is a good psychological horror film. The cast was great. The script and plot was good with having several strange characters playing a deadly game. The direction did have suspense and thrills that was entertaining. Twist may have been the weakest link in the movie. But it was still a fun good time watching the movie.","

"Escape Room","danielmanson","29 December 2020","As the title suggests this film is about a 6.5/10 so I'll be nice and plonk it on 7.I'll just jump right into what annoyed me and there was 2 glaringly annoying parts of this film which lets it down. The first is the very first scene, I won't give spoilers but it does the classic ""shows one of the final scenes of the film first"", all this did was eliminate a lot of the surprise and tension as you know full well what the outcome of the characters will be. The second is that throughout the film, more so the 2nd half of it, you're expecting some huge twist to the plot and it just doesn't arrive, so the ending is just underwhelming. It sets for a sequel as well which I find pointless.The film does have good parts and the plot does contain a couple of interesting points which give this ""saw"" plot a bit of depth. The character depth is quite good as well I thought considering it's hard to portray that in such a linear plot. Overall though I think it's just a simple thriller/horror that you can sit back and relax whilst watching. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination and contrary to what I said in the first paragraph I did enjoy my time watching this, so I'll give it a 6.5/10.","

"Escape Room","funnycommentor","19 July 2023","First of all, when I first watched the trailer of the movie I really liked it and I was so hyped about that movie! The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious, but not really innovative (because, there are too many escape room movies). The storyline was very well written, really clever and everything was well-explained. The characters were unexpectedly interesting, well-developed and some of them were really likeable (especially, Zoe). The filming location of the movie was mainly, inside the escape room. The casting was nice and their acting was really good, each actor/actress portrayed their character perfectly. It was a very intense movie, action-filled and most escape rooms were super innovative and mind-blowing. The killcount of the movie wasn't really bloody nor gory, but most death scenes were super intense. The opening scene of the movie was definitely unpredictable, super intense and very shocking. The ending twist was really good and definitely unexpected, I really enjoyed it. Overall, it was an enjoyable action movie, very intense and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.","

"Escape Room","Netscape_Navigator","25 October 2021","This was fun and suspenseful. The characters are written in a very basic way, but just enough to move along with the plot.The most annoying character was the businessman. It's unrealistic that a person in that position wouldn't know how to talk to other humans. In general, the writers had characters say things that made so little sense. For example, the businessman made a comment about ""survival of the fittest,"" after one of their friends had died, except she died sacrificing herself. One of the characters corrects him on that, and so then he says let's not waste her sacrifice. Ok, that line makes sense, but why would he even say that first line in the first place?There was another part where the businessman tried to insinuate that another character had caused the death of another. So that character the starts defending himself, and the businessman cuts him off and says to forget all that and to get back on task or something. Wait, YOU'RE the one that just accused him of MURDER, what do you mean ""forget all that,"" ***you're the one that brought it up.***The biggest thing that annoyed me was the way the girl reacted at the end when she went with the police back to the initial escape room, which is now in a completely burned up state since that's how they left it originally (it burned up after they left). She storms in and starts frantically talking about how this was the lobby, and how such and such was over here, and just going on and on. Let me break this down....* First off, why is she so SURPRISED that the room looks like this now?? How's it supposed to look? You have no idea exactly what happened to the place after you and your friends crawled through the duct. But, you have some idea that it probably burned right? Then.....how is the way the room looks now NOT consistent with that? In other words, what is it about the way the room looks now that immediately triggered her alarm bells that ""omg, someone is trying to cover their tracks by making it look like the escape room never existed and that I'm crazy."" What are you talking about, this looks EXACTLY the way I'd expect an escape room to look after an inferno had gone through it. And if she didn't know that an inferno had gone through it, then she has even less reason to be surprised about the way it looks now since she has no idea what happened to it after they left. It looks like a crazy room where crazy stuff happened. Her reaction would've made more sense if the place had been in *pristine* condition.* She's frantically going on and on about what the room looked like as if someone had already doubted her. No one had even said anything yet, and she's already reacting like her story is suspicious, trying with all her might to convince people that for all she knew, already believed her.* When she does mention some area of the room and what it used to be, the policeman IMMEDIATELY says there's no evidence of that. So that's it. You're not going to ask any questions, you just immediately assume she must be crazy?It's really not that hard to write good dialogue. Yes, it's hard to write a story, but dialogue isn't hard. You just picture what a normal human being would say given that circumstance, however fantastical or not.","

"Escape Room","rgkarim","4 January 2019","The age of horror took a major turn when the Saw series unleashed its gory thrills to the Hollywood industry. Sadly, the very edge and gimmicks it brought grew stale, as sequel after sequel appeared to dilute the quality and originality. Soon carbon copies came in, eventually flooding the market with mediocre films that didn't do much to progress the genre. Still, there are always those hopes that some quality still lurks in the chaotic slew that is this genre. Hi, Robbie K here with his first review of the year on the latest Horror movie entitled:Movie: Escape Room (2019)Director:
Adam Robitel
Writers:
Bragi F. Schut (screenplay by) (as Bragi Schut), Maria Melnik (screenplay by)
Stars:
Deborah Ann Woll, Taylor Russell, Tyler LabineLIKES:New Twist
Attention To Detail/Creativity
Good Acting
Character Development
Story
Stuck To Gimmick
Suspenseful Energy
Short Run TimeSUMMARY: These types of films fall victim to stale presentations and lack of originality. As such, the Escape Room approach was a nice twist on this film bringing with it a new creativity and approach that was refreshing. Each of the rooms had extraordinary detail, planned out to feel like the intense game of survival, filled with snares, baits, and clues to spur the threats on. Such design brought with it new arenas to engage your mind and held much more sustenance.
What further advanced the story were the characters, contenders who for once had more dimension than simple, snobbish, cannon fodder that often take center stage. These players held backstories, opportunities to learn, and personalities that evolved with each passing minute. As such, I found myself rooting for the team to succeed instead of rooting for a timely demise to end their flawed personalities. The actors had more room to use their talents to cross the spectrum and do a surprising job expanding upon what was once simple roles.
Tying all of this together those, was an engaging story that managed to combine all the backstories, gimmicks, and flair into an engaging cinematic piece that delivered on its promise, but remained interesting on many levels. Uncovering the mysteries, solving the clues, and keeping the energy flowing through the film with a presentation that was filled with anticipation and excitement. Given that they balanced the gimmick with a story it gets bonus points, even more so keeping it in the short run time leads to even more bonus points.DISLIKES:
Cliché
A few stretches
Wanting More Backstory for some characters
Ruined by TrailersSUMMARY: Sadly, all the planning and details laid out still haven't escaped the cliché and unoriginality that follows these types of films. Escape Room falls into these own sets of traps, but fortunately the spin, ingenuity, and suspense are able to divert the blunt of this area of improvement. One of those that is a bit eye rolling, is that the rooms takes some stretches of the imagination and ignoring reality to get on board. While most of it is acceptable, there are some times I had to turn my brain off extra to get over the unrealistic hurdle.
In addition, there was a little bit of adjusting the story order I would have liked to see, placing all the character stories closer to the beginning where their lives were explained in more detail. Had they done this, I feel some of the parts rushed over for me would have been improved, but this minor detail is nothing compared to my big limitation. That much of the story, twists, and fates have been revealed in the trailers to great detail. If you've got a good memory, and watch the trailer with enough focus, you'll get about 60-75% of the movie revealed. So avoid the trailers enough and you will be okay, but otherwise look forward to the last 25% to really give you the last tidbits.The VERDICT:This genre is what you pay for, but fortunately Escape Room renews the potential for greatness in this type of movie. With a focus on detail, character designs, and story integration this addition to the group was fantastic for me. It's engaging pace and suspenseful energy will offset most of the film's limitations. Given all the visuals and fun I had, the movie is well worth a trip to the theater and certainly one of the better horror movies to show up in a while, at least in terms of thriller/slasher. I certainly enjoyed this film and look forward to this direction for future installments if possible. My scores are:Drama/Horror/Mystery: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0","

Escape Room gives you a intense thrill that is similar to Old (not quite as good but Escape Room's ending is better). Escape Room probably scrapes it's way to my top 15 movies, and that's saying a lot. I love Escape Room! I love it's idea, it's escape rooms, the action, the phsyco people, everything about it.

"Escape Room","ridi-arahan","11 June 2020","What worked:
it's a rollercoster ride; you just buckle you seat belt and enjoy the show. What worked than any other movies with the same theme is giving background story, show empathy for the characters and making them work as a team for the most part. It's exciting, thrilling and maybe a bit predictable at parts but the movie as a whole worked.What did not work:
anti climatic; maybe the conclusion of the puzzle could have been stronger, with convincing scenes leading to the end. Also, the ending of the movie shows there is a sequel coming up but I did not get why they are filming an action sequence when the real event is meant to destroy the whole plane in real.Final verdict: it's an exciting movie","

"Escape Room","thebricks","5 January 2019","I loved the first Saw movie, but got tired of subsequent movies because the gore and torture got a bit too much to watch. It actually was a decent movie and is kind of rewatchable, I'll admit. I did feel at times that the characters were a bit too smart to discover certain things as quickly as they did. Still, for a January release, you expect the worst but it actually was pretty good.Many of the leads were unlikable, but that's to be expected with budget movies like this. Also, it's written like a teen movie, where people are losers one day, white collar successes the next, which is ridiculous, but that's Hollywood. Getting past this, it still is a pretty good watch and a way to waste two hours.","

"Escape Room","burlesonjesse5","9 January 2019","Six strangers are promised $10,000 if they can unknowingly win a life and death game. They have to exhaustively find their way out of a Minos Escape Room Facility in downtown Chicago (ah, yet another freaking movie that takes place in yet doesn't echo The Windy City). That's the rub of Escape Room, my latest review. In truth, I found ""Escape"" to be as disturbing or upsetting as any PG-13 endeavor I've ever seen. After viewing it, you might think twice about entering any sterile office building with I guess, one creepy employee and a butt load of surveillance.Released in January yet better than your typical January ""junk"", Escape Room revitalizes the helplessly trapped, twenty-something genre. Bucked with a hint of originality, it has elements of stuff like The Game, The Belko Experiment, any Saw sequel, 1997's Cube, and even The Breakfast Club (go with me on this one). With ""Escape"", director Adam Robitel gives us a nifty little thriller that resembles the aforementioned but in good taste. He piles on the tension, effectively inserts flashbacks, avoids any bloodstained gore, and provides riotous set designs with mounds of verve. Credit also goes to the performance of Taylor Russell as Escape Room's reserved contestant named Zoey. Russell goes from timid physics student to gun-toting badass as the film readily wears on. It's a heck of a transformation.So yeah, ""Escape's"" polar characters walk the fine line between being annoying bickers and nervous humorists. And yes, Escape Room's last act piles on twists, turns, and implausible revelations just for the heck of it (the whole diegesis might have been a hallucination or an experimental fugazi, seriously?). Still, this flick with its fringe booby traps, its inventive shocks, and its remorseless cantering keeps you enthralled for 75% of the running time. Yup, I'm down for joining this ""Escape Club"" (that's a reference to an English pop band from the 80's if you didn't already know). My rating: 3 stars.","

"Escape Room","alesjonestrader","4 January 2019","I saw this film with my wife and in-laws - just a few days after we all went to a an actual ""escape room"". Astonishingly, everybody including myself was impressed with this film. You know you have a good movie when all generations of a family like it!The acting was great - but more importantly this film had a great story. It never got boring. A very clever idea to combine aspects of the Saw films with modern escape rooms.The only criticism I have about this film is that the twist at the end was a bit of a stretch - very difficult to swallow. But Overall - an excellent film.","

"Escape Room","thailerrhyne","13 January 2019","Don't get me wrong, the people who are saying ""1 star, it's visual vomit"" are being dramatic. But this movie is not good. It's beginning and half way point are somewhat decent, plot wise I mean. Acting and visual effects are lacking in many areas. But the second half until the end is horribly executed. The fact that it sequel baits you hard at the end is also a little insulting. Save your money. Do a real escape room instead.","

"Escape Room","svhot","9 January 2019","Two thumbs up from me to the story-writer(s) , director , and producer of this new modern masterpiece movie titled ""Escape Room"". I thank the story-writer(s) for writing such a fresh story in the horror-thriller genre ; I thank the director for skillfully and brilliantly presenting this story on-screen ; and I thank the producer(s) for having faith in such a story.I really liked the fact that viewers of ""Escape Room"" were simultaneously involved in solving the mystery, together with the characters of the movie. I appreciated the revealing of various clues, backstories of the movie's characters, the characters' development as the story progresses, and well-paced screenplay. The only negative criticism I have is about the movie's ending - the ending could have been better ; Maybe the makers are trying to give hints that a sequel is in the pipeline. Anyway, overall, this is a very good, fresh entry in the horror genre.","

"Escape Room","andyajoflaherty","12 May 2023","I just randomly came across this on Netflix so decided to give it a go. You can probably guess the premise from the name alone, 6 strangers get invited to an escape room challenge, the winner getting a cash prize. However, instead of being the usual fare, the rooms are actually extremely deadly, and soon the participants are playing for their lives.I must say, I actually quite liked this. It was just the right amounts of absurd and goofy to offset the tension, and the performances and effects were pretty decent for a low budget horror. If you're in the market for a brief but decent horror then you can certainly do worse.","

"Escape Room","Groverdox","5 September 2020","""Escape Room"" is a forgettable would-be thriller which fails to do anything interesting with its premise.It assembles the typical disparate group of characters, whose attempts at showcasing their individuality is more annoying than enlightening. The way the characters grate on each other grated on me also.The plot is something to do with said characters taking part in a game where they are locked in a series of life-threatening rooms and have to figure out how to escape.The movie just goes too far outside the realm of possibility for it to be worth engaging with. It doesn't play by any set rules, and just feels lazy as a result, like they had an idea, and couldn't be bothered figuring out how to make it work.Hard to believe there's a sequel coming. I wouldn't have thought this would have been successful enough to warrant that.","

"Escape Room","eparazak","4 January 2019","From the director of last year's ""Insidious: The Last Key"" comes Escape Room. This movie is about six different people who receive a cube through an unknown identity and are then invited to take part in an escape room challenge. If they lose, their lives are claimed.I went into this movie thinking it would be an intense, fun movie that would brighten up the mood for what's to come in the cinema. In a way, it gives us that, but when thinking about it, this movie also suffers from a large share of problems.This movie's biggest strength has got to be the tension that rises with the continuation of the movie. The situations that the main characters get stuck in are highly gripping and even a little discomforting. I think the movie handled this part excellently. Of the six main characters, there are two of them that stick out and act as very believable and had me rooting for them in particular. I think this is due to how they're better established than the others. As much as this is a benefit, this also does make the movie's end result feel predictable. I find the first half better however simply because of the fact that the movie seems to lose its momentum in the second one.I mention in the headline that the movie is pretty dumb in a lot of ways. I'm not simply talking about the decisions the characters take either. Yes, the characters make a lot of dumb and nonsensical decision during the second half, but there area bunch of other decisions that ruin the movie for me. I will talk briefly about them without spoiling. The motivation for bringing the characters together is generic and stupid. There is something that happens with the female lead in the last 15 minutes that makes no sense. Finally, the ending scenes seem to exist simply to set up a sequel and a franchise. The latter also feels last minute and that it was done in one draft considering that I was very confused while watching it.Look, if you just want a mindless thriller that you can watch and have fun with, this may be up your alley. Heck I would even agree with that statement myself, however, the second half really ruined it for me.4/10","

"Escape Room","Wizard-8","10 October 2019","It seems the maker of this movie got quite a bit of inspiration from past movies, most notably ""Saw"" and ""Cube"". Those two aforementioned movies managed to be effective at times despite being made with really low budgets. So it's really strange to realize that ""Escape Room"" is much less effective despite having a much higher budget. I think that having much more money backfired because it caused these filmmakers to go ""wild"", having much bigger setpieces and challenges for their characters. As a result, the movie becomes increasingly harder to swallow as it goes along, because you simply won't believe that ANYONE would go to all the trouble to inflict this particular type of deadly terror on the protagonists. Sure, I admit that I was never bored at any point, but it was hard to care about the characters or the situation because almost everything was quite unbelievable. If you must watch this movie, it's best reserved when you're in a really undemanding mood where you won't think too hard during your viewing.","

"Escape Room","educallejero","16 February 2019","I absolutely despised this.They SPOIL THE MOVIE ON THE FIRST SCENE (amazing first scene, by the way).WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?Another thing: Usually, the characters trapped are a bit more complex than these guys. They usually start as archetypes: the egotistical douche; the innocent teen; the maternal/paternal figure; the fat/dumb guy; the hot chick. But when we get to know them, we realize that everybody has done bad things, and even the bad guys usually have good qualities.Whatever, that's what is usually done. Not this movie. This movie is nothing. The archetypes are only archetypes, backstory or not. The ""who's doing this"" has been done a gazillion times before, and probably every single time, better than here.And one thing is to be predictable, a lot of movies are in some way or another. Another thing is to be predicable, and play it like they are being new and different while also giving CLEAR EVIDENCE OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, with the already named FIRST FREAKING SCENE!Whatever. This is atrocious. Also, about that Disney thing. You have traps. You don't need to go to the extreme Jigsaw graphic violence. No need for that. But you also can't just be PG-7.They stole my money except for the first scene, and a great ""Room"" sequence. Not enough.","

"Escape Room","Platypuschow","7 April 2019","As Escape Rooms have gained in popularity Hollywood took note and 4 movies focusing on them came out between 2017-2019! Three of them in fact were simply called Escape Room.This 2019 outing is the highest budget of the four and the third that I've seen. I've always said that budget doesn't matter provided you don't swing above your weight but here it's helped no end.Both of the previous two were watchable stuff but this right here is very impressive and positively franchise worthy.It tells the story of six people invited to participate in an escape room for a 10,000 dollar prize. All starts innocently enough until things start getting a little too real.Starring the excellent Tyler ""Tucker & Dale"" Labine and Deborah ""True Blood"" Ann Woll I was impressed with the competent cast, the stunning visuals, genuine intellect and originality (Despite all the others of the same ilk recently).By the time the credits rolled my belief that this should be a franchise had strengthened. This, could be something really special. I'm not saying they should milk it like they did with SAW (2004) but at least a trilogy could be very rewarding.Fantastic movie, more please!The Good:Some great ideasVisually impressiveSolid castRipe for a franchiseThe Bad:Couple of flawed moments","

"Escape Room","six2561","13 January 2019","Watched this movie tonight with the husband. At one point, surprised myself by leaning over to him and admitted I couldn't believe how much I was enjoying it! Good story with a lot of suspense. I was genuinely into it, not wandering in thought at all throughout. I am not familiar with any of the actors, but they were all very good and believable. I loved all the detail put into each of the scenarios through the different rooms. An action-terror fantasy as I'm pretty sure actual escape rooms don't work like this. Kind of got lost at the end, we still can't come to a conclusion as to how all the rooms went away that quickly (the whole building, for that matter?), and after the airplane scene are we left to believe that all of life is just one big search for the clues to escape?? Probably a bit too esoteric for us. May be a sequel lead-in ending? ? I can't pretend to know, but I still recommend.

This movie has several influences, including Cube and Saw. Six strangers are given an invitation to come play a game and their incentive is a chance to win $10,000.00. Taylor, Logan, Deborah and Tyler are four of the six participants-they don't all survive. The only thing they are told is that if they solve the puzzles, they can win the money. Once the game starts, they realize that they are in deadly danger-most of them just thought they would be able to go home, if they failed a test. Each room they escape from just leads into another death trap. Whoever is behind the games knows personal background information-dark secrets-on each contestant. You do discover exactly what is going on and why, by the end of the movie and there is an ending set up for a sequel.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for terror/perilous action, violence, suggestive material and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.

"Escape Room","Coventry","1 September 2021","When I hear or read the words ""Escape Room"", I automatically think about those horrible - and sadly mandatory - team building activities I had to participate in the past couple of years. Escape Rooms are undoubtedly one of the most annoying and useless hypes of the 2010's. Few things in life are more irritating than having to solve stupid puzzles with people you can barely stand, only to discover that the answer to the puzzle leads you towards a new and even bigger puzzle. Giving the concept of the game, it obviously was just a matter of time before an Escape Room would get used as a location or as a gimmick in a horror film. It's a concealed space full of potential torturing devices; so basically, just a blending between ""Cube"" and ""Saw"". Between 2017-2019, at least three or four uninspired horror movies centering around escape rooms were released. They don't even bother to come up with a decent title and are all called ""Escape Room"".Until now, I had only seen a 2017-version written and directed by Will Wernick. It was awful, and I'll gladly admit this 2019 film (by Adam Robitel) is a massive improvement. This particular ""Escape Room"" has the best rating, the most favorable reviews and already turned out successful enough to have spawned a sequel. The stories of all ""Escape Room"" films are identical, obviously, but there are at least some likable characters in this one, and the writers undertook some effort to give them a bit of intellect, emotional depth and background. The deaths aren't excessively gruesome or bloody, but still painful enough for me to want and subscribe some colleagues I cannot stand. It's still predictable nonsense, though, as it takes far too long before the players realize their little game is deadly serious, and the ""twist"" at the end is blatantly stolen from a certain Eli Roth film released in 2005.","

"Escape Room","classicsoncall","10 August 2020","Tell you what, I'm almost seventy years old and I never heard of an escape room. I just did an internet search and found out that this sort of immersive group game actually exists. The thing is, what responsible business or entertainment company makes it their business model to kill their customers? Granted, the invitations to the six participants in this particular escape room didn't involve pay for play, but still. It takes a certain demented mind to get off on the torture and death of others. So with unlimited resources, I guess some major reprobates could pull something like this off.Going in I couldn't really tell in which direction this story would go specifically, but pretty much knew from the start that Zoey (Taylor Russell) would be a survivor. Even when she 'died' I figured there would be some room in the script to make it negotiable. I didn't see two survivors coming out of the game, so that was a bit of a twist. The various room scenarios were pretty creative, although the winter scene with the snow and ice cast all probability out of the picture for me.The ending of the story sets up the opportunity for a sequel in which Zoey and Ben (Logan Miller) try to get the goods on the Games Master and Puzzle Maker. I'd probably tune in to see how that one turns out, but I'm not holding my breath.","

"Escape Room","BA_Harrison","21 February 2022","Six people are invited to take part in an 'escape room', in which players must find and solve a series of clues that will lead to their freedom, the winner of the game receiving $10k for their troubles. Of course, this being a horror movie, failing to correctly solve the puzzles within the allotted time leads to death.Escape Room requires its characters to behave in a very specific way for it to work: what if one of the players didn't turn up at the start? What if all of the contestants failed to solve the first room and died immediately? What if a player with a specific skill died before they arrived at the room which was designed to make use of their particular ability? Any deviation from the creators' predicted sequence of events and it would be game over (and movie over). It's asking a lot of the viewer to ignore this fact.If you can successfully put those kinds of thoughts out of your mind for the duration, then the film is an enjoyable enough time waster, delivering plenty of tension, but little of the gore to be found in the films it most closely resembles: the Saw series. People die, but we don't get to see them reduced to bloody chunks. The fun is more in seeing how the contestants can solve the puzzles than in how messily they are killed.Director Adam Robitel handles the material confidently enough and his cast of relative unknowns all acquit themselves well, making this a slick but narratively flawed little thriller for those who find the Saw movies a little too extreme for their taste.","

"Escape Room","view_and_review","10 October 2019","Moving on from my defense of escape rooms, this movie is nothing unique in the least. This movie has been done several times before in different forms, but now they've titled it ""Escape Room"" to be contemporary and capitalize on a contemporary form of recreation. This movie is essentially a modern version of Cube--the idea of having to solve puzzles to exit a room of death.Then there are the movies Saw, Die, Hunger, Hostel, Would You Rather, The Belko Experiment, Kill Theory, 13 Sins, and others which are all predecessors to this in one form or another.This movie and the others I mentioned are fun, but I have a major problem with one part of the story lines. I hate the Illuminati aspect of these types of movies. It's so tired to conjure up an individual or group of individuals that are so powerful that they can concoct these expensive elaborate death traps for simple entertainment. And even more than the wanton spending on people and equipment just to kill is the divine ability to know intimate details of a person's life so as to recreate horrible situations they were in. I wouldn't care how much money you have there are certain things that are just unknowable unless you are God Almighty. Now, if they go for a paranormal angle then I can understand, but to believe a team of clandestine people can gather mountains of intimate details on people, recreate said details, then lure those people into the detailed trap--it's too far-fetched.Again, Escape Room is fun, but so were all of the other movies before it. I give it an eight on the fun scale and a zero on the originality scale.","

"Escape Room","opmoffatt","2 October 2022","Seems like a blatant rip-off of Saw, and it's filled with plotholes. Some of the characters are insufferable and terribly written and it is filled with pointless one-liners that force me to cringe throughout the movie. Some of the lines made me laugh out loud. The concept of the escape rooms, however, is a very cool idea and with better execution, it could've been great. The designs for the rooms were also cool but it felt *too* similar to saw. I also found it too predictable and the ending seemed forced and also a bit anticlimactic. 3/10, it gets 3 points for its semi0creativity with the escape rooms.","

Maybe it's a bit over the top but that's the style of this kind of movies, and it might be predictable at times but the general idea is working, the audience is entertained. The acting wasn't bad concidering the genre of movie, nothing mindblowing either but good enough to not be annoyed. Some reviewers compare it to Saw, which is partialy true but Saw is just a bit sicker with more gory moments.","

"Escape Room","ThomasDrufke","8 January 2019","It's the first officially released film of the year, so my expectations are about as low as they could possibly be. January has and probably always will be the dumping ground for movie releases (although September has tried to take those reigns in recent years), but Escape Room manages to be a semi-entertaining if not overtly silly mystery thriller. In many ways, the film is almost too clever for its own good. Constantly proposing new and fascinating ideas amidst a cool action scene, only to be outdone by clumsy dialogue and below average acting. But make no mistake, for an early January release, this was a solid amount of fun.6.0/10","

Neither of us seen a trailer of any kind and went into it blindly. I'm glad I did, because seeing a film you know nothing about and being high was an awesome experience.The film centers around a group of people having to get out of a series of rooms for a mere $10,000 dollars. When they find out how dangerous it is, I would be asking for a raise for all this crap. However, it's all very inventive and the scenes were pretty tense. I was at the edge of my seat.... of course I was high.However, the movie starts to derail towards the end and I predicted the ending and wished they didn't go that route. There are also some scenes where the dialogue between characters felt unnecessary. There's a fight between two characters that could have waited until they got out of there.However, I'm glad I saw it. The only way I could remember this movie is the fact it was the first movie of 2019 that I saw. It reminded me a lot of Saw, and I was entertained which was what I was asking for.","

The story is simple and unoriginal, but the setting starts off strong with some great puzzle rooms and tension. However, as the film becomes formulaic, it loses this edge and has to rely on the settings and passable special effects to keep momentum. The characters are good and well rounded, each with their distinct personalities and back stories, but the mystery behind the game is very disappointing, and the ending is poor and goes on for far too long.","

This is the premise of the movie, however, there is not much gore and some focus on the puzzles. They do try to make the characters more likable, and it did make an impact. However, if they added more of the mathematical aspects like Cube, and made the characters spend more time deducing, it would have been better. The solutions seem to be found too conveniently by chance. Yet, it delivers great entertainment, and has a not subtle set up for a sequel; which is both thrilling and cheap.

These characters have to be the worst in a movie so far this year, you're just hoping to see them die because they're complete a**holes but even when it happens is uninteresting because this movie is for babys.
One of the worst things is that there is very noticeable dubbing in the entire film, and i'm talking about The Room quality dubbing, I guess the dialogue was even worse or the acting was even more atrocious and they decided to dub every line.
The movie itself doensn't make any sense and the pacing is so slow, this garbage is like 100 minutes but it feels like is a 4 hours movie.

"Escape Room","paul-allaer","5 January 2019","""Escape Room"" (2019 release; 100 min.) opens with a bang: a guy seemingly drops from out of the ceiling into a room, whose walls are rapidly closing in on him. Will he manage to escape the room? We then go back to ""Chicago, Three Days Earlier"", as we get to know several people, including Zoey, a shy college student taking a quantum physics class. The professor encourages Zoey to do something outside of her comfort zone over the Thanksgiving break. He then sends her a mysterious black box, which Zoey finally manages to open. It contains an invitation to participate in an escape room contest. Five other people have received the same invitation (we learn much later what the connection between those 6 people is), and they convene in a third floor office waiting room... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Adam Robitel, who just last year brought us ""Insidious: The Last Key"". Here the movie makers have what sounds like a possibly intriguing premise: put a group in a room which seemingly has no way out, but of course there is if you find the right clues. In the film, the group will go through 5 rooms altogether, and each of the escape rooms has a particular theme to it. So far, so good. Alas, that is it for the good stuff. Now the not-so-good: there is no character development to speak of, with Zoey being the one minor exception. As a result, I have zero emotional involvement in any of them (with the exception of Zoey, however minor). Worse, there are no scary moments to speak of, in fact none. As a result, we merely watch what happens on the screen, but not in a scared way at all. Last but certainly not least: where is all the fun? I wasn't having any fun watching this, and it appears neither do any of the 6 lead performers making this movie. I can't help but recall ""Happy Death Day"" of a few years ago (whose sequel was one of the trailers shown in the previews, by the way). which also had an interesting premise (""Groundhog Day"" for scary movies), but which brought it with smarts, with some fun and definitely some scary moments. Too bad ""Escape Room"" couldn't be more like that. I wish I could be more positive about ""Escape Room"", but the truth is I felt very disappointed.""Escape Room"" opened wide this weekend. The Saturday screening where I saw this at in a large theater was attended okay, but just okay (about 25 people). If you are into scary movies, keep your expectations low, and maybe this will work out fine for you. Of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","

Yet, the puzzles somewhat intrigue and the fact that it's a race against time makes it fairly exciting (though repetitive). The upside-down pub was the best (and most inventive) of the lot. The climax is again, a total downer. At a crisp run-time of 95 minutes, the film doesn't let you think too much because it's custom-made for twists and last-second flourishes. Performances are serviceable, but it did look like the cast was 'trying hard'. As was the case with the latter Saw flicks (a little too much déjà vu), the dialogues are mostly banal. Watch it purely as a guilty pleasure!","

The basic premise is fairly simple, a group of six strangers receive, under mysterious circumstances, a sort of puzzle cube which when unlocked reveals instructions for an ""escape room"" experience where the winner wins 10,000 dollars. Some decide to participate due to barely being able to get by on their work salary while others are wealthy and successful and seem interested in the ""Escape Room"" only for pure amusement purposes or perhaps to challenge themselves mentally.Regardless of why they decide to join, once they arrive and the ""Escape Room"" begins it quickly becomes clear that this is no simple harmless game, the stakes are deadly and the consequences are real, and if they can't find a way to escape it very well may mean the end of not the game, but their very lives!","

"Escape Room","jtindahouse","21 February 2019","I remember seeing 'Cube' when I was a kid and being fascinated by the concept. 'Escape Room' is basically 'Cube' on heat. What surprised me most was how creative it managed to be (and I expected a creative movie going in). Some of the rooms created in this film were next level, both in their look and function. Moving from room to room kept the pacing at a very fast level as well. Add in highly watchable characters, an original concept and some clever plot twists and you have yourself a very fine film.What excites me about 'Escape Room' is the unlimited potential for sequels. There is an incredible amount you could do with this concept. If they played it right they could have countless sequels and have each one of them feeling equally fresh. While I did like the characters in this one, I don't necessarily see them needing to be the same in the next one either. They could go the 'Final Destination' route and have a different cast each film (with perhaps the odd reoccurring character).There wasn't a lot I didn't like about the film. Perhaps one of the rooms (the ice room) dragged a little too long and the ending, while I appreciated its endeavour, didn't quite deliver the knock-out blow I would have liked to nudge this up to a 9/10. Still though, the large majority of the film is a great viewing experience no doubt about it. If you're on the fence about this film, get out and see it. You'll be glad you did.","

"Escape Room","BJG-Reviews","9 May 2023","The stage curtains open ...Danny: ""Talk about immersive!""
Amanda: ""Immersive? What the hell is wrong with you? That was real!""""Escape Room"" (2019) starring Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, and Deborah Ann Woll is a thrill ride from start to finish with everything you would expect from a movie with this title. I'm gonna be honest here. Some of the reviews I've read, by critics and moviegoers alike, have been less than flattering - stating things like 'this movie fails to deliver on its full potential'. Seriously? I'm not sure what else they were expecting to see. Did they want a YA version of ""Saw""? Not enough blood and guts for ya? LOL - THIS was a fun movie and much better than what the so-called experts have billed it to be.Six very unique individuals with strong personalities have been invited to participate in a game of strategy that requires them all to work together in what is called an Escape Room - or they won't win. As the first room begins their game, they soon find out it is much more than a game. It is very real with very deadly consequences if you can't solve the puzzle in unlocking the way out. It isn't long before they begin second-guessing each other, wondering if someone among them is the orchestrator of their collective demise. As the survivors progress through this deadly maze, they come realize that they are there for a specific purpose, one they could never have guessed.I read some of the reviews for this before I watched it ... the good and the bad. I didn't have very high expectations going in, and maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much. I don't understand the negativity surrounding this film. I felt each room was original in its design, and the plot behind it all was interesting and engaging. It was decently acted with some great action sequences and thrills. I liked each of the characters as well, as they all brought something to the table worth having. Some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy in parts, I will say that much, but overall, this movie delivers.I highly recommend ""Escape Room"" at a solid 8 stars out of 10. Like any movie of this kind, you are going to find loopholes and inconsistencies, but those aside, you are left with a fun ride for 99 minutes. I've seen this movie twice now - the 2nd time because I wanted to freshen up on it before I watched the sequel (which I am about to do right now). If you aren't an extremely picky person and you enjoy a good thriller, this is right up your alley.","

We have the standard set up: six people make their way to the Escape Room venue, some having to solve puzzles to get their invites. While the progress of the film could be predicted, the game/room scenarios are innovative, perhaps an improvement in style rather than substance. Some rather cruel, indeed nasty deaths involving characters you may have bonded with. The reason why this particular group have been invited to participate in the game is an interesting if not original reveal, it comes after a few red herrings have been set loose.Good acting from Taylor Russell as an introverted student, Deborah Ann Wool as a traumatised ex-marine and Logan Miller as an underachieving slacker.

"Escape Room","baileycrawly","10 January 2021","Nobody really puts on a horror movie with the expectation that they're going to see the latest and greatest in cinematic achievements, and this movie is no different. Nobody is putting this movie on expecting Kubrickian levels of detail and storytelling. It's just a fun little thriller and, when you view it through that lens, it's a really successful movie.
The escape rooms are all pretty well done, and the way the characters (though bland and recycled hundreds if not thousands of times in hundreds if not thousands of other movies) played off each other really well. Despite being generic, there was just enough of a charm to them that, when you watch the scenario play out, you can still feel for them. When one of them does something stupid that affects another one (spoilers redacted, of course), you can feel their remorse for the situation. When the time comes for the size of the group to begin diminishing, the characters were done well enough that you're almost sad to see them go, as each subtraction changes the dynamic of the remaining members to a certain degree.
It was a very tense film and, although it took a little bit too long to get going and let me down a little bit with the ending, it was still a really solid and enjoyable film. Given the length of the film, the amount of material they covered and the fact that they needed to end with SOMETHING, I'd say they did pretty good.","

"Escape Room","jpismyname","18 August 2019","Escape Room is one of the most suspenseful films I've seen.Now, escape rooms are popular means for enjoyment. In this movie, the escape rooms become deadly and the characters must use their wit to survive.The film did not fail on the suspense/thrill aspect. The characterization is great, and the acting is nicely done for a horror movie like this. Most of the characters are someone you'll care for and root for.The movie is fantastic until climax. The writers didn't seem to know how to end the story right. I don't know, it felt messy.Still recommended.","

"Escape Room","leesimon-26357","17 February 2021","The movie looks great. The rooms look very cool. It is acted well, and the story progresses exactly like you would expect. So for what it looks like, it's not bad at all. Having said that, the story is completely stupid and preposterous, in my opinion. I personally have a hard time getting behind movies where the plot revolves around the ultra-rich picking the ""most special"" among st us, lowly, poor, flawed people to put in some ""survive or be tortured"" scenario. The more elaborate the rich person's scheme, the less interested I find it. So, this movie definitely was in for an uphill battle with me.
Having said that, if you like those kinds of stories, this is a good watch. It really looks great, and I like the tension between whatever violence befalls our heroes.","

"Escape Room","RforFilm","7 January 2019","If there's one rule that Hollywood likes to follow, it's that if something is hip and current, then it's bound to get a horror movie. In today's case, its about escape rooms. I haven't done an escape room, even through I like the concept; your with a group, locked in a room (or rooms in some cases) and you need to solves riddles, clues, and puzzles in order to get out before the time runs out. Not only does it almost make a real life video game, but it's a genius way to play up suspense where there is none.The only way one could get genuinely frightened is if the people running the rooms were good enough actors. Escape rooms are another way of illusion, and the trick will only work if they can suspend disbelief that their only playing a game. It's the same idea with video games; even if your rescuing a princess from Super Mario Bros., your really only playing programing on a computer. So the idea of taking an escape room and making it a life or death situation isn't a bad idea. So let's see if Escape Room can develop potential like a cross of The Game and Saw.In Chicago; we focus on several individuals who all receive puzzle boxes. We have college student Zoey (played by Taylor Russell), a slacker Ben (played by Logan Miller), and a successful business trader Jason (played by Jason Walker). They all solve it and receive invitations to a nearby escape room where it's also revealed that if they solve it, they'll receive $10,000. They arrive, along with former solider Amanda (played by Deborah Ann Woll), former miner Mike (Played by Tyler Labine) and escape room expert Danny (played by Nik Dodani). They all head for a waiting area for the game to start...or so they think.When one tries to leave, only for the handle to come off with a set of numbers appearing, they realize that the game has already started. Things become dangerous when the room starts to heat up like an oven. When they manage to get out, they find the next room and several others to be just as perilous. In fact, they see some of their fellow players die. The race is on to see if they can solve the clues, find out who is behind this, and why they were chosen to partake in a most dangerous game.I've said before that I think Escape Room could potentially be a good idea and I even like the angle their taking here. The problem is that the movie is dull and uninspired. Escape Room is another throwaway January release that might play better on streaming platforms, but has little reason for a theatrical release. The first problem is the characters. None of them are memorable or likable enough for care about whether they meet their death solving a puzzle or not. It's hard to tell if they needed better actors or a better script, but I'm betting on the latter, as it has to do with my other problem.The plot is fine, with the goal of simply getting out. It's the overall setup that really fails, and it's worse as I see what they were trying to do. The rooms are supposed to be themed out of a traumatizing past that each character went through. But it only touches upon their past personalities without much rhyme or reason. A character went through a drunk driving history; so let them solves a riddle and their magically cured. One man killed another in his past; so he'll take a drug and confront it. You can tell the script was rushed in favor of focusing on the thrills.I'll give this four escape room passes out of ten. I give it some credit for it's room design and idea in general. But it's too half-assed and non caring on it's characters for me to recommend. At best, if your looking for some thrills within a puzzle room, you'll get some. But for most, I'd say skip this escape room and go to a spa instead.","

"Escape Room","Firetears_X","4 January 2019","Let's be honest: no one is watching this movie with crazy expectations. If you're expecting a decent thriller under the condition that you suspend all belief, that's exactly what you're going to get with this movie. It's nothing amazing here but it did have potential to get a full 7 stars had it not been for a lazy plot twist involving the character Jason.All of the characters throughout the movie are revealed to have been sole survivors in freak accidents that killed everyone else involved. Jason, for example, was lost in the middle of the ocean with his roommate. It is revealed in the third act that Jason killed his roommate so that he could have a better chance of surviving. Revealing Jason to be a psychopath works well as a plot twist out of context but in the context of the movie it was lazily done.Jason wasn't shown the be the greatest guy of the bunch. In fact, he quickly shrugged off a couple deaths before the villainous reveal but he also had moments of consideration. It's assumed that he killed his roommate so that he wouldn't have to share a winter jacket under freezing conditions but during the game he had no qualms with sharing the winter jacket. There was also a room where the movie's lead, Zoey, nearly died had she not been saved by Jason who risked his life for her. I guess the hints to his true character was his ability to shake off the deaths of complete strangers.And while I'm on the discussion of complete strangers, you have to love a movie that spells out just how dispensable their characters are. The movie starts with introductions to Zoey, Jason, and Ben living their everyday lives before entering the escape room. Then, once they go into the escape room, the movie introduces three other characters who come from nowhere. You know right away that those three are going to die for sure just based on the fact that they appeared from thin air.During the beginning of the third act, Zoey decides to fight back by destroying all of the cameras in a room that's designed to poison the players. I loved that the lead decided to fight back instead of playing but, again, the execution was lazily done and absolutely depended on belief suspension. Zoey, under the effects of poison gas, faints to the ground, foaming at the mouth while she does so. A few scenes later, it's revealed that she used an oxygen mask from the ceiling to survive the gas attack. However, that scenario alone comes with many questions. Why would the game master even bother putting an oxygen mask in the room if he wants all of the players to die? And am I expected to believe that Zoey got back up after *nearly (I suppose)* choking to death?And then there's also that big brother element that lacks any realism. Everything in the building that supported the impossible escape rooms disappeared in the matter of a few hours. If I was foolish enough to believe that an enormous crew could dismantle six escape rooms in a few hours then it still wouldn't explain the willingness for everyone involved. It relies on Purge logic in that there are millions of people who are into observing and creating violence.All of that said, it ended on a great note where Zoey is trying to hunt down the game master. It actually has me very interested in a sequel; assuming we get to see more of Zoey being a vengeful badass.","

"Escape Room","bastos","3 February 2021","Dear Mr. Filmmakers, please stop starting your movies with scenes from the end to have an exciting beginning and build suspense. It doesn't work and it's been done to death to the point that now it only spoils part of your movie. Thank you. After this small rant let's talk about the movie. Escape Room borrows many of its concepts from other movies, but that's not necessarily a bad thing because there aren't that many high concept movies like this, and, for me, they usually work. It is an intriguing idea and makes for an entertaining ride, with some good escape room concepts and many suspenseful moments, which never make the movie boring. The characters are a bit flat and the acting isn't Oscar worthy, but that's not very important here. Another odd choice, following the horrendous spoiler opening, is the decision of only giving background on three of the characters. I would've much preferred if they had started the movie with them already in the escape room or, if you need to pad your runtime, at least give background on all of the characters or otherwise you can more or less guess who's dying first. Which brings us to the elephant in the room which is the ending (light spoilers ahead). The problem with these kind of movies is that it's very hard for the writers to come up with a satisfying ending, you either explain everything and leave many viewers disappointed because you can't deliver on the intriguing concept or you don't explain anything, leaving it to the viewer's imagination with many people complaining that it's an easy cop out. It's a bit damned if you do and damned if you don't, what I call the J.J. Abrams conundrum. This one tries the third route with a totally over the top and unbelievable ending, which is so insane that they hope people won't even stop to think how absurd everything was, while at the same time setting up a sequel, again a sin most people don't like. All in all I had fun with the movie with the exception of the beginning and ending and can recommend the movie for what it is.","

"Escape Room","kosmasp","7 June 2019","Or Cube meets Saw - sort of. I have not been to an Escape Room yet, but I do hope they are not like this ... the movie sets the mood from the start though! We get to see what the people who get involved in this have to face. And let me tell you: it is grim and it is violent! So not for the faint of hearted as you should be able to tell.It is tough to comment on acting, because this puts its characters in extreme situations (literally) and that is where it draws its drama from. If that sounds like something you like to see and experience (in movie form that is, completely seperated from reality), then the movie is something for you to watch. And everyone involved does a great job. Effects are good and even though we have to have token bad and good people, the chemistry also works overall","

"Escape Room","jboothmillard","4 November 2019","These days, everyone is trying an escape room, so it is very appropriate to have a scary movie about one, I was told this was a pretty decent film, directed by Adam Robitel (Insidious: The Last Key). Basically, six strangers with varied backgrounds are sent a puzzle cube, each solve it, and are invited by the Minos Corporation to take part in an escape room with a $10,000 prize. These six people are physics student Zoey Davis (Taylor Russell), wealthy daytrader Jason Walker (Jay Ellis), grocery store stock boy Ben Miller (Logan Miller), truck driver Mike Nolan (Tyler Labine), Iraq War veteran Amanda Harper (True Blood's Deborah Ann Woll), and gamer and escape room enthusiast Danny Khan (Nik Dodani). The participants arrive at an office block and gather in the waiting room, waiting for the Gamemaster to arrive, but nobody comes. Ben tries to leave, but the door handle falls off, revealing that the challenge has begun. The room turns out to be a giant oven that begins to heat up. The players discover how to unlock an escape passage, using weight activated table coasters, and climb out before the room is filled with fire. Danny is convinced that it is still a game, and there is no foul play. Next the group find themselves in a winter cabin, where Ben deduces how to open the door. They step out into a room that appears to be an icy wilderness, with a small wood and a large lake, one jacket to keep them warm, and the temperature is dropping. Trying to find the key or a way out, Danny falls through the ice and drowns. They find the key, which is trapped in a block of ice, they use their body temperature to melt it down. Some players notice reminders of their traumatic events of the past. The remaining five players enter an upside-down billiards bar, where parts of the floor periodically fall into a deep shaft below. They realise the room contains a giant sliding puzzle, and the missing 8 ball is the key. Amanda retrieves the ball and throws it to Jason before plummeting to her death. The next room is a hospital ward with six beds, each representing a player. It is revealed that all of the six players were each sole survivors of various disasters: Ben survived a car crash, Jason escaped a shipwreck, Mike escaped a collapsed mine, Zoey survived a plane crash, Danny survived when his family died of carbon monoxide poisoning, and Amanda survived an IED blast. Zoey deduces that the purpose of the game is to determine which player is the luckiest of all. Jason discovers that the room is about to be filled with poisonous gas. Zoey refuses to continue playing and instead destroys the room's surveillance cameras. It is suggested that someone needs to record a certain heart rate for the players to escape. Mike has the highest heart rate, but not high enough to work. Jason suggests using the defibrillator on an unwilling Mike, Jason manipulates him by mentioning the mining tragedy. Jason accidentally kills Mike with a shock. He then solves the puzzle when the gas is released. Jason and Ben escape, but Zoey refuses to follow and disappears into the gas. Jason and Ben enter a room with optical illusions and strobe lights. While drugged with a hallucinogen, they fight over an antidote. Ben kills Jason and injects himself with the antidote. He then falls into the last room, where a wall moves inwards to crush him. Meanwhile, in the hospital room, the escape room employees enter to dispose of the dead bodies. Zoey jumps up and attacks them. Ben solves the last room and meets The Gamemaster, WooTan Yu (Yorick van Wageningen), who controls the game that the Puzzle Maker designed. The Gamemaster explains that each year they lure in players with something in common, and wealthy viewers bet on the result. The Gamemaster tries to kill Ben, but Zoey intervenes, and together they kill The Gamemaster. As Ben recovers, Zoey returns to the building with a detective. The police do not believe Zoey, as all evidence of the game has disappeared. Ben is not believed either, as drugs are detected in his system. While looking at the graffiti on the wall, Zoey notices the words ""No Way Out"", an anagram for ""Wootan Yu"", suggesting the game is not over. Six months later, Zoey meets up with Ben. Newspapers have passed off the other players' deaths as accidents. Ben suggests they should move on, but Zoey refuses to do so. Ben agrees to join Zoey as they travel to Manhattan to follow clues that point to an unlisted building. However, the mysterious Puzzle Maker is already preparing to make their flight a new deadly game of survival. Also starring Kenneth Fok as Detective Li. Russell, Miller and the others give strong performances, a familiar day experience for families and friends is twisted into a dark and twisted mystery, the pace of this film almost never slows down, it is definitely the elaborate rooms that create the most excitement, especially the upside down room, a satisfactory enough horror thriller. Worth watching!","

"Escape Room","CANpatbuck3664","18 January 2019","Escape Room is another feature that is trying to start a franchise by keeping the budget down, so it doesn't have to gross a ton to break the bank (or to get the approval for the sequel). Normally, this might be considered a negative, but I think the creative team did an excellent job with the set design and the visual work for the traps. Each of them is frightening or pushes the envelope and the work done on them was good enough that I wasn't constantly questioning the logistics or how certain facets of the traps were plausible or implausible. They look great for a movie with a smaller budget and it was a pleasant surprise.The escape rooms not only looked great, but I also really enjoyed the design of the traps and how the puzzle pieces fit together on how to solve them. It showed some imagination from the screenwriter, director and puzzle designer and the unpredictability sold the danger in each environment. The scarier elements of each room really show off how much potential this premise has (if you can forgive the fact it has similarities to Saw and Cabin in the Woods). Some levels in the game are stronger than others (my least favourite was the ice room) but I also liked how the solutions to the problems incorporated teamwork and outside the box thinking. Again, there's a surprising amount of inspired work in Escape Room and I appreciated that effort instead of just phoning it in.While there's some interesting elements to the problems and environments our characters face, I wish the same detail had been applied to the script. The main group (comprised of 6-7 people) are all distinctive but they can't escape cliché when it comes to their personalities. We have the nerd, the pretty boy jerk, the social outcast etc. and I had hoped they would transcend such simple descriptions. As we find out more about them, you can understand how they're all bitter and why they don't want to trust each other but I think they could have worked a little harder on creating more unique characters. This is made worse by the dialogue being a little stilted. Almost all the jokes in this fall flat and it makes it harder to bond and root for our heroes (or villains depending on which character you're talking about).Escape Room follows in the foot steps of other horror franchises like Saw and Final Destination in its premise, the plot progression and ultimately the actors and actresses they cast. I've already mentioned that Escape Room looks great on a modest budget, but it also follows the proud tradition of hiring so-so actors to fill out the cast. I thought there was 1 clear standout performance and it came from Deborah Ann Woll as Amanda Harper. The participants/players in Escape Room are neither pure victims or virtuous heroes but Deborah shone through and brought the most emotion to her arc as Amanda. I kept hoping she was going to get more screen time and she did the best she could with what could have been a very forgettable character. Tyler Labine was the next best, he's a good character actor and while they desperately needed to punch up his dialogue, he still managed to get a couple of genuine laughs out of me and he had a few effective dramatic moments. I think the rest of the main cast (Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Jay Ellis and Nik Dodani) were okay but they played a little too far into type. For example, Taylor is a little too reserved, Jay is too mean without any provocation and Nik Dodani is forced to keep playing the same note in his acting repertoire. They aren't helped by the dialogue and character development, but they all get the job done.Escape Room benefits mostly from a great premise and low expectations. My best friend recommended this to me, and his recommendation carries weight. That's what convinced me to go see it. The puzzle design, the interesting set pieces and the overall look of the movie carry it past some of the more implausible moments and while the acting is a mixed bag, the cast does what they can while the material and dialogue try to drag them down. The ending features a nice twist, but it risks pushing the movie into some goofy territory to setup a sequel. I would love to see a sequel to Escape Room, it would give them a chance to build off this debut feature and further shape the idea into a really good movie (e.g. how they took the original Purge movie and drastically expanded on the idea in the sequels). I would give Escape Room a 7.5/10 for delivering a better than expected horror thriller but I can't go all the way to 8/10 because of some of the bigger problems. I'll round down to a 7/10. Its worth checking out but if you can't catch it in the theatre, I think you could stream it at home and have a good time.","

The intensity of the film caused my anxiety to go crazy! The plot also seemed like something that could have been a hit or miss. There have been many films similar to this one, but this one does a nice job of adding never before seen elements. I do have to say, once it got to the point with the final two characters (the drug sequence) it fell a little bit for me. I would still see the sequel though. Another thing that amazed me was the quality of the cinematography and editing. Visually captivating and disturbing. Lastly, I have to give credit to the cast. For not being very well known actors, they all managed to stay in character and portray the feelings of that chaotic experience. Definitely will be watching again!","

"Escape Room","GregTheStopSign95","21 November 2023","This movie is far better than it has any right to be, honestly. Except for the last, maybe 2 minutes? That could have been done a LOT better.A cast of relative unknowns join Deborah Ann Woll and Tyler Labine (frankly the only reasons I started watching this to begin with) for a Saw-style Escape Room movie in a shock twist, considering the title of the movie. I mean, who would have EVER thought that a movie called Escape Room would be about a series of Escape Rooms? Yeah, me neither.Anyway, for a movie that could very easily have been overly derivative and predictable as F, it really was surprisingly good. The tension was great, it distracted well from the relatively predictable story, and the relative unknowns - Nik Dodani, Taylor Russell, Jay Ellis, and Logan Miller - held their own pretty well alongside the more established Deborah Ann Woll and Tyler Labine. It's kind of a shame we didn't get to see more of them, but that would have been a very different movie, I guess.Long story short, you could do a LOT worse to fill your time than watching this.","

Escape rooms well, but not just a simple game, rather a struggle for survival against time. Unsuspecting ""players"" must discover the puzzles of each room against time and before they get killed from its deadly traps. Unknown to each other players should cooperate fully, stay as cool as possible but most importantly, hurry because otherwise everyone will die. The movie has really clever puzzles, plenty of suspense from start to finish and twists. In addition to the excellent direction and convincing acting, another positive thing is the fact that it deepens in each character of the film, so that the viewers can better correlate with the players and their struggle for survival. In the end it leaves room for an equally good sequel. It is definitely recommended and it is watched again and again with same interest! A reference film in this concept!","

"Escape Room","afrocut","5 January 2019","Let's talk about the elephant in the room first , yes this has been done before and better. Playing off of established ideas from movies like Cube and Saw the film tries to set a path all it's own, and for the most part it does but ultimately it falls back on some of those movies styles and troupes,while the script starts to fall apart . The movie gets going once it enters its first escape room and it's pretty intense as it moves along from room to room . Amazing set designs and interesting ideas involving each characters backstories scattered throughout the puzzles really help this . The actors also really are well casted , except for the main jerk of the bunch who's acting and dialogue get old fast and the troupes of the rich jerk seem tired and a little bizarre at times. Another problem is the directing on some of the flashbacks which feel very fake and don't match the rest of the movie. The film also begins with a flashforward kind of ruining some of the twists. The biggest problem is the end , it doesnt end , its sequel bait ,something these films have to learn to do better . end on an interesting twist involving our characters , don't add scene after scene ... it really ruined the momentum. And also kind of ruins the film. But I will admit when it's good, it's pretty good . Because of that it's worth a look.","

The only two things I really liked about the movie was the design of the rooms and the pacing, so I was never really bored during the movie, but it had alot of other stuff that bothered me too much. The deaths of the characters was not that amusing. The dialogue was bad from time to time. The movie felt like PG-13. How did Zoe survive the poisonous gas? And when Zoe is fighting the Games Master, he runs away and just disappears. There is a good camera angle of the room where they are fighting, so we can see the whole room, and there is NOWHERE that he could possibly hide. Suddenly, he just appears and tackles Zoe. Where did he come from?!And then we have the ending... When Zoe is going with the police to the building where it all happened, they go to the first room, which is the room that was completely burned. She explains that things used to be in certain places before it burned, like the painting with the ventilation shaft behind it that they used to escape the room. The police says that there is no evidence of that, and that's it for the police, their work there is done... Wait, what? No questions were asked, they just gave up and had to leave the premises. Lmao... The movie ends with the chance of a sequel, and the ending was really unoriginal and bad in my opinion. I was hoping that the characters did not actually die. Like the guy that went through the ice, that maybe he got washed away safely. And the girl that fell to her death, that she landed on something soft etc. I was hoping that it was all leading up to a big twist, something that you did not expect, or like in the movie The Game (1997) that it was all fake.I'll give it a 5/10. It was watchable and had some excitement, but the ending was too bad. Would not watch it again.","

"Escape Room","robfollower","16 January 2019","Escape Room centers on six strangers who must uncover wickedly designed puzzles and overcome life-threatening challenges set in hazardous environments, with plenty of twists and turns.Went in without watching trailers or reading any background info on it. The acting was great with good character development - but more importantly this film has excellent writing. The film never got boring. A very clever drawing influences from Saw (2004), and Cube (1997) ; with modern escape rooms. The production design on this film is fantastic. ""Escape Room"" is edge of your seat right from the opening frame. Loved it ! Non-stop action from beginning to end. Highly suggest ""Escape Room"" if you like a suspenseful thriller, horror, action movie.","

Most of them are extremely unlikeable, yet all apparently possess the most brilliant of minds, as they proceed to move from one room to the next, solving complicated and seemingly random clues within a few minutes. None of this helps them though, and of course they get picked off by one in various creative ways. The rooms themselves were also very visually appealing and the best part of the movie.However, things just fall apart in the final escape room with freedom supposedly attained. And that's where the movie fell apart too. Rubbish from then on.","

"Escape Room","eelen-seth","8 February 2019","Escape Room isn't a horror-film, let's be very clear about that. It's a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.The film opens by introducing half of the strangers we're about to get locked up with. Zoey (Taylor Russell) is a timid, intelligent college student who's been through some kind of trauma in her past. Jason (Jay Ellis - Insecure) is a confident yet cocky stock broker with a fight-or-die attitude. Ben (Logan Miller - Love, Simon) doesn't really know what he wants to be when he grows up, so losing himself in alcohol and chainsmoking is kind of his thing, in the meantime he works in the backroom of a hardware store. All of these people receive a gift from what seems to be people they work or study with. Once they crack open the invitation box itself, it points them into the direction of the location where the rest of the story will take place.Once arrived, we meet our other three contestants. Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll - Daredevil) is an Iraq veteran, Mike (Tyler Labine) the truck driver and Danny (Nik Dodani - Atypical) our escape room enthusiast. Before truly realising it, the game has already begun, and it becomes very clear that this is gonna be a fight-for-survival kinda game. Real flames, real hypothermia, real heights to fall from and so on.. But the game has some secrets of its own, especially Zoey seems to notice little references to events in their lives.There isn't any blood-splashing or limb-cutting present, but there are enough other ways to keep the tension building all the way to the end. This partially has to do with the exquisite art direction. Every escape room has its own soul and environment that looks expensive: a room that turns into a human-sized oven, a cabin in a snowy landscape where every step might cause you to freeze to death, an upside down bar. Every escape room breathes atmosphere and the creators have spend attention to detail.The script gets a little bit funny at times because you know it all takes place in a building - or does it?! - but a little round of applause to writers Maria Melnik and Bragi Schut is definitely deserved. It never feels like these are just some set pieces and they all have to die at some point, because you actually don't know what might or might not happen to them. Some might be displeased with the final reveal, but for me it felt like the studio knew what they were going for and yes, building up for a sequel that might or might not get made in the future. I wouldn't mind that all. Let's say, BRING IT!Escape Room could've easily been some sort of twist to revive the Saw-franchise, but I'm happy it isn't. Tight, fun little thriller with some spectacular vertigo inducing set pieces.","

"Escape Room","saptesh786","16 April 2019","We suppose that the escape rooms are only physical that they are so far, but in this movie such rooms went into the game universe framework. So we can't understand what are we watching a escape room or a game? Such thing takes us in a big confusion zone i.e. what is actual and what is imagination of game? Some contestants had already died, then how they entered into escape room again and died again? Fake images of them? No answer or explanations found here. First at all escape room is going like a oven, then a cold icy area, then all rooms are reverse from bottom to at top and further situation going on endless. It seems that the only aim of escape room is to kill the participants anyhow, no matter of prize money! End is also unrealistic. How game designer know that the last survival are planning to board a plane to reach their headquarters? Here are many questions are unanswered. This movie only keeps you busy in erratic situation and use mind to survive yourself. No logic no explanation required here. Only watch with leaving brain at your home. Then you definitely enjoy this just stupid like movie. You must watch this if you are ready to watch without brain and none of question will be asked till the end. Then go it is for you. Actors and actresses are horrible, that not perfect as role demand. Then again I said leave acting aside only watch unstoppable crazy killing brain less drama. High ratings are wrong.","

They pulled those two together in a unique way and just made it a fantastic movie. I've seen reviews that it also has influences from the movie The Box, but I've never seen it so I can't vouch for that one. The actors were great and each room was so unique and puzzling. It seemed to go from one thing to the next in nonstop action, which is what I love in a movie like this. There was never a dull moment.The only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 was because of the ending, although I could see them setting it up for a second movie which I would be pleased to watch! I also wished they would have showed the other contestants receiving their boxes since they only showed the few and how they came across theirs. You can assume the ones they didn't show received them in a similar fashion, but it still leaves you wondering.Other than those two bits that could have been better, it still was an intense movie to watch and would recommend to anybody.","

"Escape Room","selfdestructo","16 March 2022","I really wanted to like this, the trailer made it look interesting. And, wow, did I hate it. From the very first scene, I could tell I was in for a long night. It portrays one guy in an escape room, fighting for his life, as the walls are literally closing in. Every action is narrated -- Like he would be spouting exposition in a life or death situation. What's worse, it is ADR-ed to death, so not a moment goes by without him yammering. This scene took me right out of the movie.Escape Room steals aspects of Saw, Cube, Cabin in the Woods, and Hostel, and slaps on the ""escape room"" motif. Major studio: Real PC, plus an amalgam of previous ideas repurposed. There's a horror movie trope that should have applied here: The black guy who ""takes command"" (yet was the absolute last person to realize they were IN the escape room), and barks orders at people throughout this running time, yeah, he should've been the first to go. Really, this is a whole group of annoying characters, bickering with each other constantly (I'll bring up the ADR additions again) -- People in the foreground will be arguing, and seemingly a dozen other voices will be in the background conflicting with each other. Definitely overkill on this aspect.I was so distracted by the character annoyances, that the puzzles and rooms took a back seat. I can tell you the ending where the police show up could not possibly have been more predictable (cliche, really), and of course the PC police strike gold with SPOILER the mousy black girl who rebels, gets all defiant and empowered, figures the entire thing out, and is one step ahead of the lunatics/geniuses who put the whole thing together. You go, girl!","

"Escape Room","janedoe5300","6 August 2021","My first impression of this film was that it was riddled with ridiculous elements. The characters are cliches, the dialogue is dumb, the acting is at best mediocre and the direction is horrible. I almost turned it off, but I'm glad I didn't. I would almost swear (if I didn't know how ridiculous the notion is) that they shot and edited this chronologically, and everyone needed about 10 scenes before the started to know what they were doing, because the film picks up at about 20 minutes in. Everything just seemed to get better, the dialogue, the acting, the characters. Or maybe, and more likely, the plot just took off, and I decided to ignore the dumb little things and just go with it. At about 35 minutes in I was thoroughly entertained. To be clear, this is not a brilliant movie. It's a thrilling semi horror flick, pretty clearly intended for teenagers, something of a retread of ideas from other YA films, and at 15 years old I would have absolutely loved the hell out of this film. At 31, I quite simply enjoyed myself.","

"Escape Room","rockman182","11 January 2019","Now that its a new year, its time for a new year in movies. January is often known as the month where bad movies are released. Escape Room sort of looked like it could fall into that category, but I had interest in this. This was particularly because I have done an escape room a few times (although I've never escaped). Having seen this film, I wish for everyone to ignore what critics say this was actually a solidly entertaining time. About the best possible scenario for a first week of January film.The film is about six different people who are invited to take part in an escape room, one that is billed as the best and toughest one out there. Soon the participants realize that their task isn't just a game and that its a game of survival with death being the consequence. They also soon realize that their selection to participate isn't as random as they initially anticipated. The film is directed by Adam Robitel, the same person responsible for Insidious: The Last Key, which I hated.The rooms and challenges are for the most part clever. Sure, some of the solving of the clues are fast and improbable but suspend that belief and enjoy. Its a really fun time especially for a film that operates with a PG-13 rating. Who would have thought that a film based on a popular social game could actually be really good? It has all the elements of what you would expect from a mystery-thriller so its a good time in the cinemas and a good start to 2019.The film does get messy towards the end, of course you can't really expect this thing to be perfect and without any faults. Also, I really disliked the way the film shamelessly tries to set up for a sequel when it would be better as a one and done, especially since it exceeded expectations. Overall, go see it and judge it for yourself because I feel like this is a picture that will get criticism before people attempt to experience it for themselves.7/10","

However, I was surprised at how well the main characters were written and that they were each given a backstory with compelling motivations and personalities. It wasn't completely perfect, at times Danny seemed like a bit of a charicature of a geek, but even then that wasn't overdone too much. And Mike wasn't given quite as much spotlight as the others, but the other 4 characters I thought were written and acted very well.I also enjoyed the creative puzzles and how they solved them, having done a few escape rooms before I could see the puzzles are similar to an actual escape room (although the stakes are a bit more extreme in this case!)Overall, I really enjoyed watching this and now I want to see the second one!","

I wanted to see if those would be resolved by watching the first.It is a typical take on a group of people trying to survive and escape these puzzle rooms and try not to die. You could argue similar movies are Saw and Follow Me.All characters seemed alright; I actually liked the different dynamic for all of them. Ben (who ends up surviving) was actually my least favorite which made the ending a little meh. Zoey gets kind of too attached to Amanda; I don't know why you'd be super devastated over some stranger you just met dying but okay.The twist with Zoey actually surviving was a bit predictable since the movie pushes for her to be the center character but the way she does is a bit questionable. I liked that they took time to figure these puzzles out (mostly Zoey did) and that the first ""solution"" wasn't always the right one.It's a decent watch but it's not something that you'd enjoy more than once.","

There was an escape room movie that isn't this one that I believe was just a low budget Netflix effort that was cashing in on escape rooms being the hot new thing, popping up in every city. This one absolutely blew the other one out of the water.Is it that believable? The answer is no. But they had the budget to really build some incredible scenes in each ""room"" and I was perfectly happy to turn a blind eye to believability because I felt the execution was phenomenal.The different rooms/challenges were really intense, really well thought through, and the actors all did a great job portraying individual characters that you can actually get behind and empathize with.The ending was a bit trash I thought, just a joyless attempt at leaving the door open for a sequel, but the rest was awesome.","

"Escape Room","therry-69779","14 October 2023","It was a cool concept! I found the main characters likeable and the actors did really well. For the most part, in my opinion the movie was not predictable and kept me on my toes, however, there were some parts, which I thought were a bit slow-paced and could've been more interesting and suspenseful. But having been to escape rooms myself, I felt eerily reminded of the riddles and everything.All in all, the ending of the movie left one wondering. I'm definitely curious about the sequel and want to know more about the background of the escape room.I would recommend watching, it's a good thriller!","

"Escape Room","DawnOfCreation","3 March 2019","The psychological games are well designed. The script is poorly executed. Acting is really really bad. Once they're inside the escape room the movies vibe stays exactly the same throughout the entire movie. No build-up tension. Nothing. So out of boredom I started to analyze the performances of the actors. They acted too dramatic imo and it just didn't seem real enough. For example: they're in this cold environment, but none of the actors were able to portray a realistic performance of a person who's suffering from hyperthermia. For me this was the moment I lost interest.Let's take 'Alita: Battle Angle' for example, despite being a somewhat shallow sci-fi flick this movie gave me an overall entertaining vibe. Escape Room simply does not! So I left the cinema dissatisfied..To sum it up: poorly executed script + bad acting = your typical cheap nonsensical Hollywood Garbage Movie.On a positive note: I loved seeing Deborah Ann Woll, she's a rare on-screen gem imo. She's the only reason I'll rate this movie 4 stars.*English isn't my native language","

It's this kind of movie, where writers come up with a good pitch, but have no idea of how to end the story.
By the way, the movie is full of plot convenience. For example: What would have happened if more people went in the last room (the one with the hallucinogen) ? Luckily for the plot, they were only 2 guys left...","

"Escape Room","sauravjoshi85","2 April 2021","Escape Room is a psychological horror film directed by Adam Robitel and stars Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Deborah Ann Woll, Tyler Labine, Jay Ellis and Nik Dodani.To be honest i was absolutely disappointed by this movie and this movie is utterly disappointing and agonizing and apart from giving a hint of possible sequel the movie serves nothing purposeful in terms of horror or entertainment.The plot of the movie the movie revolves around the life of six people.who were invited for a game to escape from rooms in order to earn $10,000. To escape from the rooms it requires some sports which includes clues, the fun game soon turns into scare and shock as some of them starts loosing their life.The acting is weirdly bad and it seems that the acting is been done by some amateurs, Taylor Russell and Jay Ellis were the most annoying followed by Nik Dodani and Deborah Ann Woll. The screenplay is irritating and the constant fight among all six of them will make you more irritating, Climax of the movie doesn't excites and as mentioned earlier just gives a glimpse of another sequal in making.With gawky direction and dilettante acting this movie is nothing but a fine example of how to waste your precious 100 minutes. There will a section of viewers who will brag about praising this movie but well in that case i am happily on the another side, for me this is nothing but a crap of 100 minutes, please escape if you can.","

Ironically enough, this movie only enhanced my desire to do one. A very likeable and familiar cast serves their purpose through the twist and turns of a thriller that follows the now formulaic nature of the genre. Everyone gets a mysterious invite, enticed by money, and chaos ensues. Film flies by with a great mix of mystery, suspense, and action. An enjoyable time. Got to try one of these rooms soon.","

"Escape Room","SoumikBanerjee1996","11 October 2020","As a Concept, ""Escape Room"" doesn't yield anything new per se; but it bedazzles in its Execution! A competent thriller that is appealing, spirited & wholly entertaining!
All at the same time!I always look for captivating thrillers.
In this booming list of films; sometimes it gets difficult to find any. Luckily I bumped into 'Escape Room'.
The intellection albeit pretty similar to what SaW & Cube conferred way back at 2000's; what I absolutely admire is its approach for unfolding the same substance in disparate manner.
Puzzles are well structured, the visuals complimenting the same. Rendering distinctive ambience & tonalities with the help of versatile color palettes; the cinematography deserves a bucket load of praise.Story sets off on a breathless note and continues in similar fashion until it reaches its conclusion. Stakes being always high, it rarely loosen up on its steam. And that's truly commendable. The characters might have been deprived of germane backstories to support their individual personalities but on a relevance scale they did work absolutely fine.Performances are quite ordinary; but a sparkling chemistry shared between this group is something to take a note of.
I can't elaborate on the exact reason, but They all coagulated so well together.
Perhaps a great selection in casting paid off. The Soundscore had a rather contemporary influence; could be annoying to few. Personally I didn't mind much as I was too invested with the story and its persuasive progression.
My only indisposition is about the climax. Probably the solitary reason I didn't give it a higher rating! Gaping at how remarkably things were going up until the finale; my expectency had already gone up. Guess what? it let me down. Even though I distaste about how it ended; I understand their credulous intensions of setting themselves up for a probable sequel.And if that ever comes up; count me in!","

"Escape Room","alimish-84346","13 April 2019","10/10 for someone, why? Did you sleep through half of the movie? I thought in escape rooms you are working together and share all the info, you shouldn't be keeping anything away. First room and all the weights... You could solve it in different ways. And all this ""let's try this"" when they know it could make the situation worse is weird. Staying sweat in -30-40° in shirt for so long and one of them even passed out but only till the doors open and he's ready to run. Escape room specialist for some reason drop under the ice and moving away - for some reason everybody start blaming guy who should loose on foot. How they decide what the game is about in each room is really strange how could you come up that lock asking for 2nd word of band which was playing when you crash car with your friends few ours years later all this by letters on trophies. All those cliffhangers were plain stupid and they're killing chars just to eliminate them for next room. Room with antidote - so if noone dies only two would have the poison magically get to you through skin. How come that the first guy didn't have symptoms till then 2nd guy touched it? Why not to use half of the antidote and share with 2nd guy? Good that the last room was so easy that grocery guy could solve it even he got the nomination for the game by throwing the black cube out the ground and mostly not came up with anything apart magically guess trophies. Ok in ""win"" room last guy was higher... But really you can lift up and strangle adult at least 75kg heavy adult fighting for life? Well he wasn't really human since ebony shot him twice and he teleported from only place he could hide with his large body and still be able to attack that girl. For some reason they had visible cams only in rooms and not in the rest of the complex. If you make a movie about solving puzzles you should avoid this mistakes and think it through. I'm not sure, that if I'm business man with own office and assistant I would be interested to spend my time to win $10k. Everything is times so if you like this ""stress out"" Scarry movies which don't really have deep meaning and you just want to discuss it with bunch of people and making fun of it - go for it. Don't expect much otherwise and really don't fall for those high rating review.","

FFS. Come on.This movie had a lot of potential until all the super loud talking and screaming started. The plot and rooms at that point just get jumbled and messy. Hard to follow along with everyone yelling at the top of their lungs.Oh and the ending, OMEGAH THE ENDING. Would have been kinda cool if the games master was Jigsaw. Instead they hint at a sequel.

"Escape Room","vengeance20","26 January 2019","Pretty much sums up this film, which I just seen a preview of tonight.The film starts with 6 young 20 somethings being brought together to take part in a mysterious Escape Room event. Each of them was the soul survivor of an horrific accident in their past lives, but each of these strangers has no idea why they were selected, or whose is behind it the event in the first place. So as you'd know, the group are put into an escape room, & there follows the typical traits of an escape room, find clues & figure out how to escape the room. But this room leads to another & then clues & revelations of their pasts start to unfold as the film goes on.I found the film to be pretty decent. It had the Saw & Belko Experiment themes going on & I can't help but feel the Now You See Me Films have a sort of reference in this mind**** of a film along with Hellraiser also playing a role too. It had a solid ending which leaves a door open for a sequel. (I hope!)But my complaints of the film were that it wasn't gory, in fact, it was almost bloodless. Reason for my complaint on that was the kind of promise that this was going to be like Saw. Now although I know full well this was a 15+, I still feel the gore could've been kicked up to a near Saw standard. I also felt the deaths were pretty crap & unimaginative, I mean, this film had the potential to make the death sequences unique given how unique the sets & rooms were in this film.The film was pretty much a dulled down version of what Saw is pretty much. It's solid, unique & entertaining, but could've been gorier & more fast paced, the film dragged a bit to be honest. I also felt the film went off the rails a bit & could've been more grounded.But overall it was a pretty decent film. It had both good & bad points to it, but it was unique in its own right. Though it could've been gorier, with the deaths being better & more grounded topped with a fast paced treatment.7/10","

"Escape Room","Orby2283","7 February 2021","I for one was sucked into this movie through curiosity. A movie about escape room(s) that will literally kill you? I am so in. While the movie does lend itself some really good ideas those ideas seem very bare minimum. While all the actors are really good everything around them is not.A very predictable plot that you could probably guess right off the get go. And despite the cast giving it their all the characters in this movie lack more development, some times they all come off as a-holes, and other times you wanna root for them.The escape room ideas themselves don't seem as fleshed out enough, they could have been more interesting ideas around this premise but it all felt very standard. while tense in some places, the pacing didn't let you sink in that time to really feel that suspense.Average movie overall with a good premise and good acting, but very little in terms of interest. I might watch it again if its on, but its not something I'd recommend unless you were really curious about this type of movie premise.","

"Escape Room","jcosully","5 January 2019","In comparison to other January thrillers, Escape Room definitely stands out against the others. It excels ahead of Insidious: The Last Key, The Bye Bye Man, The Forest, And The Woman In Black 2: Angel Of Death, which are all January releases. Granted, Escape Room isn't amazing, not even great, but it is definitely a step forward in the right direction. I would definitely recommend this if you like thrillers, and if you are on the fence, go see it. It's not great, but if you go in not expecting much, it's pretty enjoyable.The first thing that really stands out is the set design. Each of the rooms has its own distinctive style, filled up with small objects that make the rooms feel more realistic, but not too crowded. They feel like real escape rooms, and each room was thought out as to how they would affect a certain character and their thoughts. The characters were also fine, the movie did just the right amount of backstory, providing enough information so we know the characters and some of their backstories, but not too much so the thrills don't get bogged down by an overload of emotions. The actors themselves do an okay job, the standouts being Deborah Ann Woll and Logan Miller. The only really bad performance was Nik Dodani, but it was obvious that no thought was really put into the character, because he was just a throwaway. The deaths in the movie were also good, because there wasn't much of a focus on the gore (to keep the PG-13 rating) but it actually works out, so the movie doesn't really slow down at any point to show bleeding out characters, or have long emotional scenes. There is really only one sentimental death, but it also doesnt stay too long on that. The brisk pace of the movie keeps everything going, never stopping, so it stays entertaining. That alone is probably the best part of the movie, it never loses it entertainment value. It's fun to watch characters solve their way through the rooms, just narrowly escaping death. Even though the characters are very one dimensional, you still root for them. The last great thing about this movie is that it knows what it is. It doesn't try to be a super sophisticated twisty thriller. There were so many opportunities for it to have huge twists, but it ignored those, and just kept moving along. That made the movie a lot easier to enjoy.The movie does falter though, and it does especially during the third act. There are huge plot holes that leave so many questions, and that aspect was really frustrating. It became unrealistic at one point, and there were just lazy excuses made to cover it up. This all happened toward the end, which factors into the ending. I personally don't think that the ending was as terrible as everyone says, but it still wasn't very good. It spent the final minutes setting up for a sequel, instead of creating a satisfying conclusion. It just branches farther and farther out, making a million different possibilities for sequels and franchises. Even though the ending was bad, I'd go pay to see the sequelOverall, I'd definitely recommend Escape Room. It's isn't great, but it is better then most January movies, and if you like horror movies or thrillers, go see this. If you go into it with no expectations whatsoever, you'll probably come out pleasantly surprised.","

"Escape Room","thirtyfivestories","29 January 2019","Exactly one year after his last feature film that saw him ending (fingers-crossed) the outlived Insidious franchise, Adam Robitel returns to begin another franchise that surely will not have the lifespan of the one it is imitating. He delivers a pilot installment that maybe only Jason Blum would be proud of, hitting various Blumhouse beats with more enthusiasm than even last year's game-to-film adaption Truth or Dare managed. These Blumian (a descriptor I am pained to invent) tropes include characters reading aloud text like a zealous mother, a clunky ten minute group ice-breaking session that clinically checks all the expository boxes, and the ""twist-ception(s)"".Six individuals all receive the same elegantly quirky puzzle box from colleagues and loved ones. Ben, a grocery boy, attempts to use brute force to open the cube, while Zoey, a physics student scribbles diagrams and notes as she unlocks what is an invitation to the world's most immersive escape room. Jason, a financial wizard, utilizes YouTube tutorials to crack his gift, and apparently the $10,000 prize for escaping still appeals to a man who initially expected a Prius key when his package first arrived. After all the participants are gathered in a waiting room of a seemingly barren high-rise, we're introduced to a happy-go-lucky trucker dad, a gamer boy turned escape room enthusiast, and an intimidating woman (her caricature is revealed later) rounding out the players now trapped in what will become an architecturally perplexing series of rooms.The clues scattered throughout the rooms are just barely more subtle than the hints plopped into the dialogue revealing the unifying trait of all the participants. It is far from a spoiler to comment on how painfully obvious that the escape room is more a social experiment than a game. However, our gamer boy Danny tries his darndest to immerse us into the game by effectively giving a ""Escape Rooms 101"" lecture to the gang. Trucker dad Mike eats this up with great appreciation as will many audiences who aren't privy to the new entertainment craze. This goes beyond exposition dumping, and feels eerily similar to an in-game tutorial, which oddly enough, doesn't feel right in a movie.Where the film lacks creativity in character development, its set design flourishes with imaginative decisions that tie into the players' pasts with relative frequency, providing a human anchor to an otherwise procedural death trot similar to the cult beloved Cube. An upside down jukebox bar steals the show by offering the most integrated use of clues worthy of an indie walking simulator game remake. But collect all the rooms together, and the difficulty curve resembles a goose bump: not challenging in the slightest. I knew that this would be where this film lived or died, and it perished early into the first room when I hacked the game's system and saw a much more efficient solution involving glasses and a couch. I effectively mentally speed-ran the rooms in an effort to milk joy from my viewing.If predictability is the film's greatest sin, then the dialogue is the lesser sin. The performances from the auxiliary characters are particularly rigid, but this too can be blamed on down-right lazy writing that at one point has a college professor give our wiz kid Zoey an extracurricular homework assignment of ""doing one thing that scares you"". Yet I'm still fearful of a potentially greater sin lurking in the closing moments of what I'll call the fourth act of an otherwise brisk movie: the sequel(s) option. The same blue-balls Netflix original series ""binge me some more daddy"" gut punch arose, and now SONY's plan was revealed. Once again, I do not view this as being in the spoiler family, because what is inevitable is inevitable.Now only time will tell if they can rise to sustained success that Twisted Pictures basked in with the 8-film series chronicling a sinister puzzle designer. The difference here is tragically obvious, Escape Room's puzzle designer is totally morally deprived. There must be a method to the madness, this mastermind only has business propelling their madness, which I'm saddened to report doesn't generate the intriguing tension between torturer and victim that its gorier predecessors at least attempted to balance. Speaking of gore, my first ""so PG-13 is what we're going to do?"" badge of 2019 goes to this gem for copying the formula, but diluting it in the process. A worthy excuse to create a dungeon crawler thriller I will admit, but contrary to gamer boy Danny's hilariously ignorant exclamation after barely evading flames, this one is far from immersive.","

"Escape Room","kryptonarie","11 April 2019","Out of the 3-4 escape room movies I've seen, this is one of the best. Sure, the premise of this film is nothing new, and yes the acting is a bit weak at times, but the characters were still effective within their particular roles and/or type of people they represented. What I liked was how details about the characters were presented, how they were used as a nexus to tie the characters to specific puzzle elements in each of the rooms. The Escape Room was more original from other movies I've seen of this type. Lastly, the level of action from start to finish was good, and it kept me watching to see what would happen next. I thought Panic Room was more than a reasonably entertaining bit of escapism for my brain.","

"Escape Room","lukasmatkovicdm","4 August 2020","First movie of 2019. A great year for film started really underwhelming. It'sa cool concept done really poorly. It has no identity it's just so safe. Even bad ones you know Saw film when you see one. But this one just holds back sooo much. First two acts are just Pg-13 Saw and then 3rd act gives such bad answers. On the positive side production design and rooms were well done. I gotta get credit where credit is due. Rooms by themselves were kinda fun. It's decently shot and better than most low budget thrillers. Some actors were fine (not all of them). 8 pool room sequence was really cool. That's it. Film takes itself way too seriously and it just doesn't want to have fun. If it was more self aware and tongue-in cheek it could've work. Characters were unlikeable and awful. They didn't get developed and on top of that most of them are just bad. And nerd character was so annoying. They were very stupid in their decisions too. Because of them puzzles weren't as tense and egaging as they need to be. Pacing is not good as well. First 2 puzzles just took so much of time and then other rooms were incredibly rushed. Acting was wooden. Thank God main actress went on to Waves because this is... Last 30 minutes give answers. Answers are not explained all the way because of the intrigue (I mean sequels) but answers that they do give were nonsensical and just confusing. Like who are this guy who just watches people die? How can they erase whole rooms? How can they make room on the fricking plane?! Holes were so big.
Overall: Mess that could've been great self aware comedy but it's not.

The film was very tense and entertaining for the first 3 escape rooms but after that the plot and writing fell apart in my opinion. As a result the film became very predictable. The ending was meh at best and they set the movie up for a sequel I have no interest in seeing. I give this a 6 because I enjoyed the first half of the film but it didn't finish strong at all. I'm an A-list stubs member so this movie didn't technically cost me anything but if it did I'd be a little disappointed.

"Escape Room","thesar-2","18 August 2020","I had a hearty laugh 55 seconds in when one of the opening production company logos was for ""Original Films"" and this is THE THIRD MOVIE CALLED ""ESCAPE ROOM"" in as many years.Actually 2 were made in 2017, only one was released in 2018 and this third, unrelated entry was showed in 2019. Now, so far, I've made it past the 2018 released one and this 2019 ""final"" movie with the title. I actually really liked the 2018 edition. And now I LOVE the 2019 one.It is, in fact ""Original."" This 2019 Escape Room couldn't be further from the 2018 released one. Which is a good thing. Now we can enjoy both.I digress. This movie was fantastic. It's for Saw Movie Lovers. It's for Escape Room fanatics. It's for Strangers Thrust into a Game/Cube and have to work their way out. Only this time: I actually gave a damn about the characters.Yes, I've seen the three Cube movies, the eight Saw films, the Single-Digit Belko Experiment and called The Game a GREAT movie. But, this time, I genuinely cared about each and EVERY character. Well, only one was an asshole, but he still attempted to help other victims 50% of the time.Basically, six strangers receive a boxed invite to win $10,000 for being ""the ONE"" who survives a known unbeatable Escape Room in Chicago. Only, early on, it becomes apparent this...Is.... REAL. Now our stranger victim/main players have to solve riddles, learn about themselves and help each other out to survive this deathtrap series of rooms of which they should be familiar with.I DID care when a character died or did what they could for others. It was SUPER nice to see not the worst in humanity as we normally get in these movies where unwilling victims fight amongst themselves with survival instincts and flat-out murder each other to live. This cast actually tried to be human or moralistic.I loved the sets and world-building, the dialogue/jokes had me rolling, the acting NEVER lagged and aside from them starting on a 3rd floor of a Chicago Highrise, I truly believed in all the peril these people were put in. You want tension, suspense, horror and human redemption, check out 2019's Escape Room. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.And quite frankly, who can say THAT about a January release?***Final thoughts: I try not to do any research on a film I really want to see beforehand. So, it was a nice and pleasant surprise to see a long-time crush of mine was in this: Tyler Labine. BUT, more importantly: Deborah Ann Woll was another one of the cast. I LOVED her as Jessica in True Blood and it took me a little while to get used to her as a Human Role instead of supernatural in the TV series. But at least it was good to see her again, since the series died. Wish I could say the same for Labine...he's NOT as cute as he used to be. Sigh.","

"Escape Room","youngcollind","8 December 2021","It's not original by any stretch, I scrolled past three other films called Escape Room with virtually identical premises on the way to write this review. Not to mention the influence of Cube, as well as real life escape rooms, a popular trend apparently begging for a cinematic interpretation.The performances are imperfect, occasionally throwing out corny dialogue, and often pushing the boundaries of realism, even within the over the top scenario.But does any of this matter?What the film does put on the table is a family friendly rendition of the death game setup, boasting a bigger budget than any of the preexisting Escape Rooms. This results in some awesome production design making for some very inventive traps. If you can allow yourself to get wrapped up in the simple pleasures of ""oh no, how are they gonna get out of this one"" then it can be a fun ride. It's mindless entertainment in the best possible way.It unfortunately ends on a sequel bating cliffhanger, which I'm hoping isn't part of a larger trend as some films just aren't franchise worthy and should probably wrap things up in their allotted time.","

"Escape Room","petereviews","8 September 2019","The Good: I had no intention of watching this film until reviews consistently said it was worth an afternoon tv watch, which I have to agree after watching it for free.Wisely steering away from horror, the movie is a fun little thriller, ratcheting the tension up in each escape room. These escape rooms are the highlight of the movie, as some of the clues to solve them are particularly clever, especially in the first room.While I expected the characters to be detestable, I was surprised to find most of them likeable and for me to actually be rooting for them. While they are cliches, they bounce off each other quite well.The Bad: The actively bad section was the final 20 minutes where it becomes revealed why these people were put there. The explanation was ridiculous, and it was very shameless how the movie did it's sequel-bait.Apart from this, nothing was actively bad apart from this movie not being particularly exceptional.Film Highlight: In the first escape room where the characters find out things are not what they seem. The tension here was raised magnificently.Conclusion: Recommend watching as a light afternoon or evening watch.","

It is entertaining and not boring throughout and provides enough thrills and interest. Solid characters although stereotypical, but we get to know them and do start to root for them.For a B rate thriller type, people seem to have much higher than needed be expectations. The trailers show exactly what type of film to expect. Don't watch the film expecting an amazing complex plot or articulate acting. Simply for the suspense, thrills and journey and you shouldn't be disappointed.Although the ending was clear sequel bait, it worked as there will be an Escape Room 2.

"Escape Room","eddie_baggins","11 November 2019","It may not make an ounce of sense and it at times features some questionable acting and directing choices, but when watched with the right frame of mine, Escape Room is the perfect escapist piece of entertainment that will be a lot of fun for anyone that loves a good puzzle/Saw like thriller.Taking the worlds obsession with escape rooms to a whole new level by adding a life and death spin on the popular past time activity, Adam Robitel's low-budget but well-staged horror thriller is one of those nicely constructed genre entries that never takes itself too seriously and fully embraces it's over the top concept to provide some memorable kills, set-pieces and twisting and turning narrative that seemingly wants to set up future installments.Opening with a hurry as we are thrown into an escape room that doesn't seem like a whole lot of fun, Robitel quickly introduces us to a range of characters that form the basis of our main team of escapees, with Taylor Russell's brainiac student Zoey, Logan Miller's supermarket working slacker Ben and Jay Ellis's snobbish businessman Jason forming the core of our disposable group of humans, who are all nothing more than thinly drawn caricatures and pawns for the films money making concept of a genuine real life escape room where a failure means perma-death.By very early on realizing what it is and what people want from the experience, Escape Room finds a very fun groove as we move from room to room with our collection of players that find themselves under threat from a room of fire, an icy solitude or a disappearing elevator shaft, plus other threats and the film creates a game within itself as we begin to create wagers in our minds about who will escape and who will not.Much like recent horror success Happy Death Day, Escape Room makes a nice space for itself by providing a fun and over the top horror yarn that is more thriller than chiller and while hardcore genre fans may be disappointed by the lack of scares or gore in the film, its inventiveness and creativity will keep you entertained throughout, even if you do wish the people we are playing this game with were a little more likeable and unique, making the stakes of the whole dastardly affair that much more engaging.Final Say -A fun, silly and totally enjoyable romp, Escape Room is not fine dining cinema but its willingness to accept what it is and run with it means another adventure in Adam Robitel's freshly created universe is something to look forward to.3 defibrillators out of 5","

However, each room that the players enter has a connection to one of their pasts. The guilty party must expose the secret in order to get the combination to the lock. But with teammates dropping fast, those remaining must unmask the gamemaster before time runs out.Piggybacking on the popularity of locked rooms and the torture horror movie craze, this low-budget ensemble does have some intense moments, but the derivative and inconclusiveness ending derails everything that came before it.Besides, the easiest way to breakout of an escape room is to take the teenage attendant hostage.

As a claustrophobic horror movie where the characters are killed one by one by puzzles you would expect some more imagination and shock values.I watched it to the end, so it kept me interested late at night.Not sure why this has a 15 certificate.

"Escape Room","peisherman42","1 April 2022","The plot is exactly what you would expect from a movie called ""escape room"": 6 people vastly different from each other receive a invitation to go to a escape room with the winner receiving a 10000 usd prize, just to be surprised when the challenges end up being actually real.There's nothing really genius about the escapes rooms, they just have to find clues that will lead them to the next one, with a skill from each participant being used as they advance through the rooms. And that's actually a good thing, cause every time those movies wanna do a super clever charade or something, they end up being lame (with a few exceptions). But even if they are, in a way, ""simple"" to solve, they're still fun to accompany and make the movie more real.The acting is good, the characters aren't too exaggerated or clichés and are actually pretty interesting.The movie has a few plot holes, but most of them are silly and predictable, considering the gender and the plot, so I could ignore (but I took them into account when giving the rate).","

"Escape Room","citrine1129","6 January 2019","Granted movies like this have been done before- saw, a past escape room, etc, but this movie was absolutely brilliant. The characters never did anything wrong (except 1), unlike in SAW, when they all did something wrong or hated life. Instead, these characters are brought together by unfortunate tragedies that led them to have to fight for survival. The characters are not the stereotypical ""blonde, stoner, virgin, smart guy, and buff guy."" They are all unique and the female leads are so powerful. One served in Iraq and the other is African American studying Quantam Physics. There is also the super smart guy who has played escape rooms many times before. More than one incredibly smart person who is also a virgin. Most of the movie is completely unpredictable and has you on the edge of your seat for most of it. It is so brilliantly played out and has numerous twists and turns I never saw coming. Most horror movies nowadays are predictable or based on jump scares, but this one was completely psychological and made you really feel for the characters. 9/10 beautifully made, coolest horror movie I have seen in a very long time!","

"Escape Room","HafizhMaulana21","2 December 2022","Six strangers meet each other in one room which becomes a deadly game. They have to solve the puzzles of each game to be able to survive and escape.Escape Room is one of the films that performs poorly. This movie doesn't have a great appeal. By presenting the concept of survival from a deadly game, this film appears so bad both in terms of the story and dialogue presented. Escape Room has a story plot that is not well constructed. A story that feels bland and shallow. In each of his scenes there is no such strong tension. The film feels so flat. It doesn't provide enough emotional side to present the conflict that's being built. The conflict presented also cannot be regarded as a conflict. Dialogue that is not constructive and seems perfunctory in dialogue. No dialogue is the key to a mystery. How not, in dangerous situations there seems to be an expression of each character that is not like a panicked person. Their look was so flat and sucky.Although it has a good story concept, this film does not have a good execution. The cast lineup is uninteresting and performs far from what we imagined. How they perform and act like zombies playing a movie. Have no emotions and are incapable of building their character.","

"Escape Room","karlakreso","16 April 2019","I really liked the movie, there were good scenes filled with anticipation but how the events played out in the end kinda ruined the movie and I'm talking about the part where that game master or whatever dude tries to kill that long haired dude, that girl comes in and shoots him. And I'm pretty sure I saw blood if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me but the dude just gets up and runs like nothing happened and when he attackes girl there's shot of his back and there's no gunshot wound whatsoever. Also when that girl escapes her room how exactly did she find her way to those two?? I don't suppose it should be easy since the building is huge I mean I know that's the plot and something that has to happen for the story to keep going. But still. Escaping the room was also easy... oh and I forgot this, when that long haired dude got strangled he was dead, there was x over his picture, then he came back to life. Same thing happened with the girl there was x over her then she came back and that game master dude was thrown into the game like how does that work?? Is that camera supper smart? She knows when people die, when people are alive, she understands what is going on so she can make decisions in game orrr is there someone behind camera if there is then that girl couldn't have escaped bc I suppose there are cameras everywhere in that place and people behind this surely wouldn't have left their own people to die especially if they're important. Which that dude was. Also how did they know every single detail about them? Especially in situations like them singing car in a song. How would you know that? Maybe dude mentioned it when he was in a hospital but I don't like them(people behind this)being portrayed like gods, knowing every single little detail. I want an explanation how they got to that information.
Again it's good movie I really enjoyed it, but they could've put a little more effort into it.","

Obviously the game soon turns into a desperate struggle for survival.This is a great little horror movie with a touch of sleuthing thrown in.
The traps are scary and unpleasant but without the gore and brutality of say Saw.
The characters are less stereotyped than normal horror but you can still pick out the jock, greedy banker, over achiever, nerd etc.The affects stand up ok but be prepared to squint at the places where the CGI budget ran thin.There is nothing amazing about this film but it does what it sets out to do - for which I applaud it.
It doesn't try to be as dark or stylised as ""The Cube"", this is happier being lighter and more accessible.I feel it went a bit too far at the end and wasn't really sold on the direction the post film was taking.This won't blow your mind but you will have an entertaining ninety minutes.","

I did see the trailer and it gave me strong ""Saw"" vibes so I went in thinking it'd be a saw copycat without the impact.While there are ""saw"" and ""hostel"" elements , this film add it's own flavor to the survival film franchise. Throughout the film we get short glimpses of each characters' tragic past which helps us as the audience actually care about these people. There is something for mostly everybody to relate to so it can sorta feel like you could be in this situation. And that's the beauty of a film , making the audience feel in that moment like they are there.The acting is hit or miss at times and there are a few corny lines, but above all this was an intense film that was also comical at times. It seemed to have taken inspiration from a plethora of survival films and kind of merged them into one film , using an original modern day scenario ; seeing as though escape rooms have become very popular in recent years.Creepy , Intense, Gut Churning, and Funny.

Throughout the whole movie I knew who was gonna be the last one standing, because of that first scene. It ruined a bit of the fun in guessing who was gonna survive. Now the end of the movie makes up for the first scene, which i am happy it did. Anyway, let's go back to the start.Six strangers gets invited to this ""escape room"". The six character are very stereotypical, but i didn't mind. One thing i did mind was that i didn't care for any of them. I thought someone was the main character, but she honestly didn't do much in a big chunk of the movie. MAny of the other character i found relatively annoying. So the characters weren't the best part of the movie.The premise i found rather fun. I like movies like this, were a few different characters has to make it through different rooms, all with lethal challenges. I think the rooms in this movie are all good and creative. So that part i liked. I liked how the room were connected and all the challenges. You do have to accept this movies reality though. It is not exactly the most realistic movie.Minor spoiler.The ending sets up for a sequel and honestly, even though this movie was kinda dumb and the ending was really dumb, I don't mind and I would probably enjoy a sequel.
Final thoughts:
If you can turn off your brain, accept this movies reality and ignore the characters(and maybe skip the first scene) This movie can be a fun watch. I admit that is quite a lot you have to do to enjoy this movie and i get that, therefore many will probably dislike this movie a lot and i won't argue. But i found this kinda fun.6/10","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","gbill-74877","31 March 2022","A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it's frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.On the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I'm all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn't care for how naïve Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to ""fix"" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","masonsaul","15 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Neptune165","19 March 2022","Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humorless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that ""my back"" joke and Norman Osborn repeating ""I'm something of a scientist myself"". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.This movie certifies that Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility and MCU Spider-Man lacks that. He's had 6 movies and still acts like an inexperienced, immature, not independent, not smart and acts like a rookie. And the whole plot started because he couldn't think of an alternative to get him and his friends to college so he got Doctor Strange to go and make a spell so that everyone will forget that Peter is Spider-Man(also doing it without his friends consent). And of course with Peter being the doofus he is, he messes up the spell which causes the multiverse to collide. There's a reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him. One of Spider-Man's best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears). You'd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains in Far From Home but no; he does it again which caused Aunt May's death. It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be ""cured""(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It's also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you're like ""yeah this guy sucks"" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May's death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben's infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn't even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight.Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","IPyaarCinema","21 December 2021","Review By Kamal KI don't think this film was written well. It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom's Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark's mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter's whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn't experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn't leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the ""jokes"", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom's Peter? Bad writing at its finest.Yes, this whole movie could've been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU's portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland's acting is great.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","BandSAboutMovies","18 December 2021","It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","blott2319-1","24 December 2021","I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post ""Into the Spider-verse"" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was ""really, we're going there?"" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","paul_haakonsen","12 March 2022","Right, well I am by no means a fan of superhero movies, but I will watch them when given the chance. Why? Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don't they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" here in 2022.Actually, my family went to watch ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn't go, as I don't think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.Visually then ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn't it?""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of ""Spider-Man"" in general.My rating of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","16 December 2021","This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D. And once you've seen it, please don't spoil it for others, just like you won't want it spoiled for yourself.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","statuskuo","6 January 2022","It most likely Sony has to continue to soft re-boot this exhausting tedious story in order for them to maintain rights. In this case, it throws the entire kitchen sink including nods to the multiverse.In this one Peter Parker rues the day people discover he is Spiderman. And in order to allow his friends to live a normal life he goes to Dr. Strange to conjure up a spell so he would be forgotten. Seriously. The entire movie is predicated on a stupid wish. Well obviously that goes wrong and a dimension portal opens to different worlds where villains dont recognize the present casted Peter Parker. Seems clever on paper but it is a slog. The only gimmick is that we see Peter Parkers from previous flicks. What you get are momentum killing conversations between the Spideys. Which, for fans, suppose it's great to shoehorn legacy. For people who are too young to know anyone of the previous ones. Im sure theyll be confused.This entire movie moves at a snails pace and suffers from bloat. You can slash a half hour and still be fine. This culminates in the death of Aunt May. Because, if you follow the storylines Spidermans have to have a loved one die at their own stupid decisions. When will that end?I suspected this would be the typical messy CGI garbage. And it didnt disappoint. It is greenscreen heaven.There is a better story here. This one felt unnecessary.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Oh_Capital","19 April 2022","It took me a while to get around to watching No Way Home. There was so much hype, and people were declaring 'the hype is real.'I feel alone on an island thinking this movie is terrible. I get that people were psyched about all the old Spider-Man characters coming together for a big super fun time, but that does not cover up for how nonsensical everything is in this film. (Spoilers incoming)First the good. This will be a short segment. The idea to bring all the characters from the previous Spider-Man movies together through the multiverse is an awesome concept. The execution however was lazily conceived.The two constant problems in the movie are the cringey dialogue and the incomprehensible decision making. The movie starts with Peter Parker's identity being revealed. Now if your identity is revealed where is the last place you want to go? The answer is your house. It appears no one told the writers this because that is where Parker goes. Also, Parker ask's Strange to put a spell on the world so his friends can go to MIT? How is that his rationale? Yes it gives purpose for the rest of the film but it's a lazy story telling way to get there. Why would Dr. Strange agree at all to that. He is a freaking wizard.There is not a single line of dialogue that is intelligent. It's all cliches, lines that have been in previous movies, or just pop culture language with no substance. Towards the end I was cringing at the back and forth between characters, especially when Goblin says ""I'm something of a scientist myself."" Yes we know that when you said it 20 years ago. (I loathe fan service.) There were a couple jokes that landed but overall I was laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny, like when all the Peter Parkers were in the lab with their goggles and test-tubes finding cures for the villains in less than 5 minutes. Again, lazy writing.This is a movie for children who have no concept of reality or care about a well thought out story. (End rant.)","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","FixedYourEnding","20 March 2022","I feel sad to be living in a time where a movie like this can get high ratings. This movie is for low-attention-span adrenaline-immuned viewers, which unfortunately there are more and more of. Unless you are a group of teenagers looking for a night-out, I would not recommend this movie at all.I didn't expect much from this movie other to be an entertaining comic-book-like story. Boy, was I disappointed. It has been no more than a collection of random fight scenes with incoherent story and almost random dialogues in-between. Also, I think the casting of Spider-man, M. J. and Aunt May are just horrible. Tom Holland appears to have the brain of a 10-year old, and Zendaya is great in other films, but as MJ she just doesn't work, same goes for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) she looks way too young, flirty and brainless, exact opposite of what this character should be.Overall it is a slaughterhouse to everything that spider-man should stand for. It is concentrated around universes and egocentric personal problems instead of being a moral model of real-world problems. The 2.5 hours long movie seem to just be an adrenaline shot one after the other, no substance and nothing to learn from. I'm sadden by having to write this, the production quality is great but where is a plot, a moral and generally being a better person. Sony should be ashamed of themselves for dragging Stan Lee's creation through the mud like that and Marvel should consider terminating their license for this creation. Seriously.","

Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kosmasp","20 December 2021","There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many ""climactic"" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where ""magic"" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ...","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Criticalstaff","14 March 2022","It might be the worst movie ever made. Not just because it is bad, but because of the misuse of all the resources that went into making it.I will be the first to admit that I have propensity to look for meaning when I am watching a film. Be it the straight-forward moral of the story or a higher meaning, something to make you think. That is how I enjoy cinema the most, when it gives me something to think about. Big or small. When the images on the screen are about something more than simply the images on the screen.This film is the complete opposite of it. Its meaning is inward-looking. It is not interested of looking at anything other than itself. It is complete and utter navel-gazing. That really is the crux of the film. That is the reason why this is barely watchable. Every flaw and mistake comes from this movie's own excessive self-contemplation.Where to put the blame is a different question. It has been established for some time that these MCU films are not ""directed"". There is no singular vision behind them and it boils down to an assembly line. The plot and dialogue are so bad I can't imagine anyone put any amount of thought into it. All the lines do actually feel like ad-libs the actors improvised on the day. Visually there is an absence of flair (and I am being generous) which is on par for the course for these movies by now. The soundtrack and sound design is, of course, forgettable. The editing is conventional. The set design is reminiscent of those real-estate videos where celebrities show their homes. The costume design is ok, again which is not shocking knowing the means that were allocated to this.The acting could have been the saving grace of the movie. Unfortunately, Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are the stars of the film. And while their performances are good, they usually have to share the screen with (multiple) Oscar-winners. It is jarring to see the best talent doing what is basically glorified background work. That is why this is the worst movie of all time. You have a film packed with the best actors working today, but we have to follow Tom Holland's inane struggle on how to apply to some college.I am not even sure I want to go into the plot. In truth it does not matter. I suspect that even the makers of this took that as a given. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now morphed into a never ending reference and call-backs machine. That is the core of this film: ""remember this?!"" The structure of it is one of a TV show, except in TV there is an A-plot and a B-plot. This film is all B-plot.As I am writing this, this film has been viewed by millions and is one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Please kill me now.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mhorg2018","20 December 2021","This is the best film Marvel has released this year. Shang-Chi was only ok, the Venom sequel was atrocious, Black Widow was so-so, Eternals was bland for the most part. What makes this one work is the cast, but the story really, when examined is weak. The last movie put the writers in a corner while revealing (a silly idea really) Peter's identity to the world. He goes to Doctor Strange without thinking about what he really wants, and ends up, in typical spider-man fashion, in screwing everything up. So, also in usual Spider-Man style, by trying to fix things up, he totally messes up further. In the end this costs him a lot. While this movie starts out well, the middle is dull and why should Peter care about beings from alternate realities? And by 'fixing' them, did he erase the events of those films, making the spider-men of those realities unnecessary? Peter loses everything due to his listening to Aunt May, who's advice is illogical and gets her killed. Well, I can say this was the best of Holland's trilogy, but it still isn't Spider-Man 2. A few sides: Molina, Garfield and Maguire's returns were the best part of this movie. Those three steal every single scene they're in. Dafoe was good as Norman, but I could have done without Electro and Sandman who added little to the story. While others are falling over themselves gushing over this, I think I may be suffering from Superhero fatigue.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","BrnzReviews","15 December 2021","Peter is back! Everyone knows who he is and that's the problem! This is a fantastic spiderman movie, no.. this is the ultimate Spiderman movie. This was such an experience i honestly felt like a kid again. I can't believe they returned! I was so happy to see my childhood come to life.This was a incrediblely told story about The 3 peters and how deep responsibility truly is, I'm shocked with excitement in we had the great men themselves return to their respective roles which included Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Thomas Haden church and many more. I've always been a massive fan of Tobey & Andrew so seeing them come back was the ultimate time of my life. I loved every second of it, i wanted to review this with no spoilers but that is literally impossible ao i now have +1 Spoiler review.There were so many nods and callbacks to the past which i thoight went very well & Garfield finally avenged not saving gwen!Highly Recommend! A Must See!!! 11/10.","

I'm glad I managed to see in IMAX at 11:40 AM well worth it especially with an audience that reacted loudly to exciting bits. I absolutely love the grand scale of everything from the multiverse, characters, massive budget, tingling sense is so well done, and the humor is spot on.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","msbreviews","15 December 2021","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Spider-Man: No Way Home is one of the darkest, saddest, emotionally draining entries in the MCU, surpassing all of my expectations.Despite a messy, convoluted first half with some pacing issues and occasionally frustrating, poorly placed humor, Jon Watts, Chris McKenna, and Erik Sommers more than compensate these minor issues with some of the best (and brutally violent) Spider-Man action ever witnessed on screen.In addition to this, the surprisingly coherent narrative packs shocking developments and actually offers enough screentime for the villains to significantly impact Peter Parker's arc. Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.A heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.A memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.""Rating: A.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","atlasmb","11 March 2022","My expectations for this film were off the chart due to what I had heard and read about how great it is. What it does deliver is plenty of spectacle. But a great film needs more than that. The story also moves along with some pace. But emotional impact should never be sacrificed for expediency. In short, this is an enjoyable film, but there have been better Marvel films.There is one scene that stands above the rest. And it is guaranteed to bring a smile to the lips of any Marvel fan. It has so much subtext and it is so unexpected.It ends with a tee-up for the next chapter, of course. I just hope that one focuses more on the characters and less on the effects. It certainly has that possibility, given where this episode ends.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","EpicMovieCompilations","16 December 2021","When Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire enter the movie, the cinema rightfully erupts into a hail of cheers and applause. The experience of Spider-Man: No Way Home is bizarre. Not only do you spend half the runtime just waiting for the return of a familiar face, but grow weary of the current cast which've headlined the previous MCU entires. Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon cannot hope to carry a film on its own terms, therefore No Way Home relies and depends on the presence of legacy. Far From Home (2019) was borderline unwatchable. Cheap-looking, tone-deaf and accompanied by a forced, cringeworthy romance (which doesn't improve here by the way) it is surely the worst Spider-Man movie of all time. This threequel holds the unfortunate title of runner-up. It shares many of the same problems...First of all; technicalities. As with most MCU movies, the cinematography is flat and the colour palette is dulled for no apparent reason. The action set-pieces aren't very inventive and hold no iconography, always taking place on a boring, painfully obvious green-screened environment. Why does the Statue of Liberty look like that!? Why has the Lizard's design regressed from 2012, and why do they recycle and super-impose B-Roll footage of Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman, or Rhys Ifans as Curt Conners? It's so lazy.Aunt May's death barely affects me emotionally, because thus far she's been portrayed as this bubbly, whimsical character with very few scenes of actual conviction. Can you imagine if this was Rosemary Harris or Sally Fields' Aunt May? The difference in my reaction would be night and day. Moral of the story, don't cast the most gorgeous woman alive as Aunt May... Speaking of conviction, why does this film feel the need to inject a cheap gag whenever it's in proximity to a remotely serious scene? These screenwriters have to go back to basics, and refresh themselves on the fundamentals of tone. Not to mention, most of the MCU's humour so infrequently lands, and caters to the lowest common denominator audiences. That's not to say there aren't a few smart quips here or there, but for the most part, I was confused by the amount of chuckles surrounding me.No Way Home is, clinically, a bad movie. Take for instance, the First Act. Much of the world wants Spider-Man hunted down and defeated. He's interrogated once, and then freed on behalf of a pointless cameo by Daredevil himself, Matthew Murdock. Like, what? There's no ramifications. He just gets to live his life despite being an enemy of the state. Does the world think he partook in a terrorist plot or do they think he snatched a candy from a convenience store? I'm a little confused. I guess the consequence is that Ned and MJ don't get into MIT... Big deal. I don't care. These are poorly written characters. Bring on the multiverse villains!What can I say on that front..? I was grinning from ear-to-ear in seeing Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina), Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) back again. Hearing their musical cues gave me goosebumps, as did some of their dialogues... It's a testament to the actors. There's some serious talent in The Sinister Six. I love their interactions. For a second you'll think to yourself how cool it all is, how you should just be thankful a film like this is even possible... But again, why have it at all if it isn't done correctly? Take for instance, the final battle, with one of the glaring objective errors of the film... Tobey's swingin' around, pulling off epic Spidey stunts, and there's no hint of Danny Elfman's beautiful theme... Same goes for Andrew Garfield, who had the privilege of having two great themes by James Horner and Hans Zimmer respectively. What was Michael Giacchino thinking!? He already dabbled in old themes for the villains, so why not for the heroes? If the movie is dead-set on fan-service and and legacy (which it most certainly is) then why on Earth not include these terrific tunes? Instead we just get orchestral renditions of Tom Holland's theme, which utterly PALES in comparison! It's just the same progression of notes.On to the Spider-Men themselves... Andrew Garfield has probably solidified himself as my favourite after watching this, while Tobey Maguire remains legendary by default since he was my childhood Spidey. Tom Holland doesn't come close. I never liked him in the role because he's not tangible. He's too pure and honest; thereby becoming illegitimate as a realistic humanistic interpretation. For whatever reason, Tobey Maguire gets stabbed, fatally it seems, by the Green Goblin. Thing is, he survives... So why bother scaring us? The moment doesn't serve a purpose, other than to provide a sudden, stupid shock for the poor audience. Ultimately, each of the villains fade away, back to their own universes. It's totally anti-climactic, not to mention there's no rematch or even a solid dialogue exchange between the Green Goblin and Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. Malpractice from a storytelling standpoint; odd, considering that on the other hand you have a terrific scene where Andrew's Spider-Man catches MJ from falling to her death, as he failed to do so with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)... Does narrative closure not apply to all facets of these films? Or did the writers just get forgetful for Tobey? Either way, the ending leaves much to be desired and leaves you wondering: what was the point?Individually, scenes work well. But this isn't a clip show. It's a film. To conclude, No Way Home is a mess. One which nearly totally collapses prior to Andrew and Tobey's appearance. Their scenes are fantastic, and all criticisms aside for one minute, I am grateful I got to see 'em on the big screen one last time. I love it when they bond over shared losses, and Andrew and Tobey's little exchange in the lab... No Way Home is an occasional treat, however nonsensical and pointless on the whole.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","alindsayal","15 December 2021","Finally, the biggest film Spider-Man: No Way Home has hit cinemas and I had to go see it as early as possible. Now I have watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Man's secret identity revealed, he tries to get Doctor Strange's help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause problems for both of them.Main Character
Tom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see how he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world. He doesn't have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I thought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.Supporting Characters
Zendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything that goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels natural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really good, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some really interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character. Jacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character that supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is back as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce off and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in their roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.Story
The story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of a character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for me was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their characters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.Script
MCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is really handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didn't outweigh the serious and darker parts of the film.Style
The film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from the other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good, despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isn't really any filler here which is an impressive feat.Overall
Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I have just watched the film but I can't find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will find this film plenty of fun.Rating - 10/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","JohnDeSando","17 December 2021","Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Peter (Tom Holland): ""The problem is you trying to live two different lives. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it becomes!""Notwithstanding the ""home"" in the title, the exciting new Spider-Man: No Way Home is more about the existential need to create one's own identity, the Christian need to give up a life in order to gain it, and the human need for a second chance. Many super-hero movies continue to emphasize the hero's need to recover a parent or child even more than the need to sacrifice for the good of humankind.As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggles with the attention he gets because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) revealed his identity, he gets involved with Dr. Strange to erase his super-hero identity from everyone's memory. Fooling with Mother Nature never is good in these hyper-active fantasies, and it's true as Peter tries to get Dr. Strange to reverse his initial memory-erasing spell in order to remain in the minds of those he loves.Besides, what director Jon Watts and his writers are really interested in is pulling the three Spidies together (Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) to remediate former bad boys like The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Strange clears the way between parallel dimensions to let each Spidey's version of villains to come together for their cleansing.The imaginative and entertaining concept of getting these characters together proves not to be confusing but revealing of their generous natures and the benign fraternity of Spider-Men, adding the collaboration motif into their otherwise solitary lives.Although the digital gymnastics are impressive, beyond those is an attempt to flesh out character for both good and bad boys. Discoveries abound without super sentimentality or long exposition. Because the filmmakers have taken care to load meaning into most dialogue, the revealing third act takes the plot to dizzying heights while character spills out along the way.As more is found out about the heroes and the villains, the long road back to normalcy for Peter seems just about right, filled as it is with triumphs that come from working as a team (not a normal Spidey thing to do) to suffering the loss of dear ones to a better cause. It's a coming of age at any age and a satisfying display of character development that might be envied by indie films everywhere whose bread and butter is a similar attempt to show humans at their worst and best.Super holiday fare, yes; challenging, yes; amazed I am that comic-book stuff holds meaning amidst its visual splendor, yes.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","hellsbells75","2 January 2022","I watched this with no prior knowledge of the plot. I had heard rumours but not enough, so each cameo was a genuine surprise for me. Even with that element, I was left dejected.Why? Well, first of all it made no sense. It seemed a ridiculously contrived way of bringing back old villains and actors just for the nostalgia and fan nods without any real premise. It makes no sense that the all powerful all knowing Dr Strange would risk the stability of the universe to get a few kids into college. He knows far too much about actions and consequences to fall into that trap.And Peter's ridiculous idea to save the villains he doesn't know, who belong in another universe, and who have done despicable things to his own alter egos, using what...some science stuff that just happens to be in Happy's apartment? We never know quite how he builds these ""cures"", we just get blinded by movie science talk enough to understand that it's ""science"". Just like Peter trapping Dr Strange in the Mirror Dimension by using ""math"". It's like those old 80s movies where a computer whiz taps random things into a computer and it can do amazing things! How? We don't know, just shut up and eat your popcorn!The dialogue fell oddly flat too. I'm a Marvel fan and I enjoy the witty banter, one liners and emotional moments but this fell way short for me. The jokes weren't funny. The interplay between characters felt written by a kid trying to emulate Marvel wit. I just didn't feel it. The 3 Peters answering to Ned calling their name was just rubbish. It simply wasn't funny.And the sentimentality felt forced and false. They all cried so many times. Soaring music over the top. Tears and hugs and therapy. It descended into pathetic, and I didn't want to see good characters being pathetic. I get the angst and pain in previous movies but this was pointless and Peter literally destroyed everything including his last remaining family member over nothing. At least the other Peters' regrets were real. This was borne out of pure nonsensical decision making. He wanted to kill The Green Goblin. Why? He was only there because of Peter making ridiculous choices and Aunt May only died because she was as stupid and misguided as Peter. He was just doing what villains do given half a chance - a chance Peter gave him for no logical reason.The fact he saved them in the end was irrelevant and actually did a massive disservice to the previous movies. It devalues what those other Peters did and went through. You may as well cure them too by stopping them getting bitten by spiders in the first place if you're going to be that kind hearted and change history.Would those villains really want to go back to their universe a changed person anyway? They were flawed, broken and destroyed everything they loved. Now they get to go back all ""fixed""...to what? A broken destroyed world they ruined to no doubt face justice for it. Great, thanks Peter! I think their glorious deaths would have been better. Or are the other Spidermen supposed to smooth it all over when they return?And last but not least, the whole ""forget everyone knows who Spider-Man is"" thing is just crazy. As if Dr Strange hasn't learned enough from trying to do it the first time. Why forget Peter Parker completely? Why not just forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man so he keeps his friends etc? So there was Happy at Aunt May's grave not knowing this was her nephew? That makes no sense at all. What happened at the Statue of Liberty then? What did MJ and Ned remember?I came out of the theatre disappointed. It wasn't like MJ said. I actually expected not to be disappointed, which made it worse.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","akoaytao1234","12 March 2022","It would be unfair to say that I never really laud as great films BUT I always admire this ability to create quality escapism.With all that, I think Spider-Man: No Way Home might be the first film of that series that I actually hate .Firstly, this film feels so juvenile to the point that it is annoying. I guess this is a film not really made for me. I found the way Hollands tries to plays up the good boy persona exceedingly off-putting AND not needed. Zendaya and the Filipino guy are just a figment on its story. They even tried to gentrify the ""other"" versions of Spiderman film. Funnily, I love all the treatment for the Original Spiderman characters. Otherwise, its a mixed bag.Secondly, I found the cause of conflict in the film so unnecessary. It does not make sense for me why and how it happened. It feels like watching a cash grab for fans.I mean the conflict of the film is that his presence as a superhero has such a negative effects to their live that they were ultimately banned to their collegiate school BUT it is contrast with a rally showing their popularity too. It is like be consistent film. Even the spell is hinged on the fact that they did not plan. They go on as if this is a thing he does every time BUT he just goes for it without really thinking through of the whatnots. Ultimately, the choice of Holland Peter to armchair psychologist ughh. Just watch it, its like a Bob the Builder-esque plot line.Ultimately, what really sour me about the film is the Dr Strange Conundrum. Why even watch when the consequences can be reversed and played on? I mean, he did had some in the end BUT is it really not deserved. As a viewer, I hate it from since the Avenger films BUT I hate it more so this time, because it actively says it can AND it can even personalize it.Overall, this is a pure cash grab for people who are watching it for the characters but not the content. Its pretty much anchored on a very weak premise AND feels like a connective tissue for things to come. [0.5/5]","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","therapeuticsuicide","21 March 2022","They wanted to find an ingenious way to put all the Spider-Mans together... and they DIDN'T.And why would they bother?! What does this accomplish that's so special? They obviously wracked their writers brains to the point of mediocrity to settle for this very cheap excuse to combine all the different movie Spider-Mans in one movie apparently for the sake of novelty, because the story serves absolutely no purpose, AND it just resets everything for Tom Holland's Spider-Man, which makes the previous 2 films really inconsequential, on top of creating a dilemma for any future possibilities of featuring all of those villains we've now just seen, which technically Tom Holland could have had versions of in his own franchise. This film was a waste of time, and one of the very worst in the entire Marvel series. In my opinion, everyone involved in coming up with this concept should be fired.","

The movie was so boring that I actually fell asleep at one point. The plot was very childish and unnecessarily long. I heard that some people actually left the theater out of boredom. I assume the high rating was only possible because of such strong a fandom. Overall, I felt like I just lost 2.5 hours of my life.","

Sure some of the comedy doesn't quite hit, there are some pacing troubles and not every character has enough screen time to flesh out their character.But despite its problems, this film excels at listening to the fans and giving a spider-man movie that will be remembered as ending an era just as endgame is remembered for the avengers.","

It's jst the hype talking so much, the comedy as usual MCU always tries too much to be funny.. and it fails.. This film is carried out by cameos.. Lazy writing.. The only good thing was the ending.. That's it.. Definitely not the best.. and not an 8 IMDB rated movie.. Dr Strange is better than this IMO..","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","drqshadow-reviews","18 March 2022","Instantly loathing the publicity of being outed by the press, Spider-Man hits up the Sanctum Sanctorum to ask Dr. Strange for some mystical assistance. They cast a spell of wiped memory and screw it up, reality is torn, familiar faces invade different spaces... you know this, you've seen the trailer. It's the Sony/MCU equivalent of X-Men: Days of Future Past, with a stream of old band members coming out of retirement for a jam-packed farewell concert.One might hope that the results are a smidge better than that old X-Men reunion, and they are, but No Way Home also suffers from many of the same problems. Primarily, the overwhelming urge to stuff as much crap on the screen as possible, even when the audience is already exhausted. It tries to serve too many masters and, in the end, sufficiently serves none. There's fun to be had, especially when the oddball mix-and-match super-characters get the chance to escape the trappings of a broader storyline and simply converse as individuals. Those accessible human interactions have been a big strength for the two preceding Marvel Spider-Man flicks, and they reap great benefits here, each time the old guard mingles with the new.I wish we had more such moments, but the push to turn the MCU's most grounded franchise into another big-time tent pole attraction demands otherwise. In reaching for the next major event, they've overlooked the ""neighborhood"" part of ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man."" Actually, they might've forgotten the ""friendly"" part, too, because there's a whole bunch of angst spinning around Tom Holland's central performance. But that's more excusable: Peter Parker goes through a lot over the course of this hundred-fifty minutes, he progresses and matures as a character, and he's experienced equally dark times in the comics.No, the performances aren't the issue here, nor is the dialogue, which remains snappy and delightful. The primary culprit is the plot, bloating and careening in indeterminate (and often mindless) directions, making a lot of noise but not making a lot of sense. Dr. Strange hand-waves many explanations under the guise of mysticism, which is basically his thing, but so do the various Spider-Men. Important members of the supporting cast are marginalized and under-served. The city of New York, once an essential ingredient, is now barely a backdrop. Goalposts are moved, overshadowed, and then moved again. Rumor has it that script re-writes were still underway during filming, and it shows.This is messy. Lots of fun on certain occasions, but stifling and sludgy in others. It's a mixed bag, leaning more to the positive than the negative, but I don't know that I'm content with the way everything wraps up in the end. Where Homecoming and Far From Home both left me charged and anxious for the next step, No Way Home put me in a place of quiet acceptance. Feels like the franchise has aged, and that's not a great thing.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","akdjreview","15 December 2021","Following constant disappointment with Marvel movies, I had come to stop caring for or even watching any. But Spider-man has had a special place in my heart since a kid so I had to watch, especially after hearing rumours. To tell the truth, this exceeded my expectations with great power.With surprisingly good acting and great emotionally loaded scenes, No Way Home managed to capture something many Marvel movies fail. Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a story-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting never seen in the Marvel universe before.No Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which I think old fans will admire. Nevertheless, I believe this movie was fantastically done and little mistakes.No Way Home is a great movie I highly recommend. Especially to the Marvel fans like me that had gotten bored of the new stuff.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","lareval","15 December 2021","I do not think this is a totally perfect film: It is too damn easily to spoil it, probably the middle section is not as powerful as the start and the epic finale, some of the characters are thrown into the plot rather than enjoy a well developed evolution like Peter Parker himself and I was not exactly a fan of Holland's era due to a lackluster couple of previous solo films. But this third solo movie is his best film to date, one of the most impactful MCU & Superhero movies and one outing that redeems and answers all my complaints regarding what came before.Here, MCU's Peter Parker finally shows some cracks and faces true trauma, developing a true commitment to his own adventure even being extremely populated by plenty of beloved and nostalgic other ones. Here, Parker's Spider-Man finally gets to grown in me, being faithful to the source and ending his evolution within Avengers universe on a riprousingly high. The performances are really strong, the script covers its plotholes & weaknesses with energy, tragedy and fun so well mixed and the ending looks like a true ending to Holland's Spider-Man trilogy.An excellent entertainment and a shocking surprise. I did not buy any trailer nor stinger from this movie and I was blown away. Best Spider-Man movie tied with 'Spider-Verse' and Sam Raimi's 2004 sequel. See it now!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","evanston_dad","11 February 2022","""Spider-Man"" fans are going to have a total nerdgasm over this movie. Those of us who haven't seen all the Spider-Man movies and aren't knowledgeable about the Marvel universe may have a good time but also might be left wondering what all the hoopla is about.I only saw the first two Tobey Maguire Spider-Mans and didn't see any of the Andrew Garfield ones, but Tom Holland is definitely my favorite actor to play him. This movie is too bogged down by exposition and has a saggy middle section that tries for heart-tugging drama -- why, why do these junk food movies try to be more serious than they should? -- but I will admit that the ending gave me the feels. I'm not really chomping at the bit to see where this story goes next, but it was fun enough seeing this movie with my 10 year old son.Grade: B.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Anurag-Shetty","16 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home takes place immediately after the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home(2019). After Mysterio reveals Peter Parker's(Tom Holland) true identity, Peter's world is turned upside down. Peter goes to Doctor Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch), to make the world forget he's Spider-Man. However, the spell goes awry & villains from the multiverse show up. Now, Peter will find out what it truly means to be Spider-Man.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an awe-inspiring film. Director Jon Watts has perfectly completed his Spider-Man trilogy. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The humor & the emotional scenes are on point, just like every other Spidey movie. You will cry, laugh and cheer till your voice gets hoarse. Tom Holland is spectacular as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Tom Holland further solidifies that his portrayal of the iconic superhero, is the best. Zendaya is outstanding as MJ. Holland & Zendaya share electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Jacob Batalon is superb as Ned Leeds. Jamie Foxx is brilliant as Max Dillon/Electro. Willem Dafoe is phenomenal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Dafoe proves yet again, why he's the best Spider-Man villain in the entire franchise. Alfred Molina is excellent as Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus. Thomas Haden Church is great as Flint Marko/Sandman. Rhys Ifans is impressive as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a must watch for die-hard and casual Spider-Man fans. Go & web up a whale of a time!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","johnnyhbtvs27","16 December 2021","Went to see this opening day to avoid spoilers and boy was i pleased i did. Going in not knowing what was going to happen made the movie so much better. Seeing Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire & Tom Holland all together really is a fans dream and Marvel are giving so much fan service in all their movies lately it really is staggering.I feel most of all, the movie does well in giving Andrew Garfield some love as the Spider-Man character as he mostly gets a raw deal these days as his movies weren't as strong as Raimi's or MCU ones. Andrew Garfield was a good Peter Parker & Spider-Man, he just didn't get that film where he could really shine and this movie practically says as much.Managing to get so many villains to reprise their roles must have been a tall order (i was more surprised to see Thomas Hayden Church back than anyone).The story grips you right from the off as it takes place immediately after the second one & some of the twists and turns i found quite shocking (i should have known better about Aunt May but it still took me by surprise).The ending is really beautiful in a nice sort of way, seeing Peter interact with MJ after the fact is a real heartstring puller. It ends with a conclusion to the trilogy whilst leaving the door ajar for more Tom Holland Spider-Man movies (which if there is any justice, there will be).Tom Hardy's cameo at the end sets up Venom (or at the very least, a version of) to join the MCU, which should be a blast. The idea of Tom Hardy & Holland playing off of each other is cinematic gold.All in all, i think this is the strongest MCU Spider-Man movie and may be the ultimate one for massive Spider-Man fans. Sam Raimi could never have imagined 20 years ago whilst making Spider-Man (2002) that his characters would be still portraying themselves all these years later in the biggest cinematic universe and franchise ever, truly remarkable, just like this film.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","MrDHWong","16 December 2021","""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is the third solo Spider-Man movie to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Tom Holland once again in the lead role, it goes without saying that this is the best live action Spider-Man film ever made and probably ever will be made for that matter.In the events after ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"", the secret identity of Peter Parker (Tom Holland) as Spider-Man has been exposed to the entire world after his fight with Quentin Beck/Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). No longer being able to take the onslaught of media and public backlash, Peter seeks help from Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. However, during the casting of the spell, Peter accidentally causes things to go wrong, fracturing the multiverse and leading to the emergence of many villains from realities unfamiliar to this one.Aside from Batman, the superhero that has left the most impact on me personally is Spider-Man. In fact, the very first superhero film I ever saw at the cinema was the 2002 Sam Raimi-directed ""Spider-Man"" starring Tobey Maguire. I'd probably go as far to say it is that film I credit with helping to kick-start my fondness for the genre as a whole, paving the way for many others like it. With ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" acknowledging not only the original Raimi films but the Marc Webb-directed, Andrew Garfield-led ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films as well, there was bound to be a lot of speculation surrounding whether or not it could live up to all this hype. In short, the answer is a resounding yes.Not since ""Avengers: Endgame"" has a Marvel superhero film affected me on such an emotional level and not since the 2008 ""Iron Man"" film has a solo hero story left this much of an impact. Of course, to discuss my favourite parts would give away vital spoilers so I won't go into too much detail here. I absolutely love the amount of respect paid to each of these series of films. Even the divisive ""Amazing Spider-Man"" films, which I actually liked despite their flaws, are treated with just as much love and affection as their Raimi/MCU counterparts. Moments like these go beyond simple fanservice and are clearly there as a thank you to everyone who have stuck with this iconic hero for almost twenty years now. They certainly put a big smile on the face of this responsible 30-something adult.The concept of the multiverse was first teased back in ""Avengers: Endgame"" and further elaborated on in the Disney+ series ""Loki"". However, for the most part, those ventures had a proper sense of management preventing things from spiralling out of control. Here, everything feels like fair game. The stakes are at an all time high as these villains pour out from their respective universes to seek vengeance on their particular Peter Parker, not knowing that they won't find him here at all. Anyone who knows me will remember that I love stories that involve alternate realities and history, so to see something like this combined with a film about one of my favourite superheroes was nothing short of wonderful. This film keeps you on your toes as you anticipate who Spider-Man will fight next. Again, I won't reveal which of the villain fights excited me the most due to spoilers so all I will say is that each of them had at least one moment that made the young kid inside me very happy.Tom Holland has come a long way since we first saw him don the Spider-Man suit back in ""Captain America: Civil War"". His high-spirited youthfulness has not waned over the past five years since he still has that uncanny ability to entertain us with his unique take on the beloved hero. That's not to say he is only capable of light-hearted fun, as here we see him demonstrate some of his darkest acting to date. This film definitely isn't afraid to hit us hard in the feels at the most appropriate times, frequently delving deep into Peter Parker's emotional state at such an important point in his life.Additionally, I have finally come to accept Zendaya's performance as MJ. It has taken me three films but her version of the character has finally grown on me. Originally, I found her pessimistic attitude and willingness to bring the mood down highly annoying but she has now matured into a vital ally of Peter that I enjoy seeing on screen. Naturally, her chemistry with Holland feels genuine, considering the two actors are actually dating in real life with their romantic scenes adding that much needed heart to the film.I won't speak at length about any specific villain as that will give away major spoilers so all I will say is that seeing each of them again in one place was quite overwhelming, but this time in a good way. It's both amusing and surprising to see Raimi-era villains interact with Webb-era villains who are equally as confused as to why they have been transported into this universe. Something that certain Spider-Man films have come under fire for is their cramming of too many villains into one movie, leaving the story cluttered and incomprehensible. This time around, it actually works to the film's advantage since the idea of there being multiple universes following a different timeline has already been properly established. Something like this leaves things open for other multiverse-related oddities happening in future MCU projects, which excites me greatly.Since the film has set the bar so high, I can't help but wonder how the MCU will ever be able to top it. Like ""Avengers: Endgame"" before it, ""No Way Home"" should be treated as something of a watershed moment in the entire MCU. It succeeds in entertaining both longtime fans of the Spider-Man character who have been watching him for nearly twenty years while simultaneously serving the purpose as a great continuation of the ever-expanding MCU storyline. With that said, I think all fans of Spider-Man owe it to themselves to see this film as soon as possible. And yes, I do mean ALL fans.I rate it a solid 9/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","leestoych","17 December 2021","If this movie didn't have the 3 boys joining forces it would've been a 6/10 for me. What we got was a shaky plot with Ned whipping out doctor strange moves after 0 training and peter risking the universe collapsing for the lives of a few random villains. Lazy lazy writingAnd the end fight we had maybe 10 seconds of our 3 Spider-Men fighting together. The rest was choppy scenes of each character fighting their respective villians. Where was the unity? Thats what we wanted, some combo moves between the 3 at least :(There were obviously some great moments dont get me wrong but i feel people aren't really taking the movie for what it is. Deluded by the marvel hypeThis is what happens when the hype is too big. What was MJ's line on disappointment? Yeah it applies to this film.My 4 main issues...1. Ned mastering the Doctor Strange Ring instantly (0 training)
2. Peter's decision to steal the cube from doctor strange because he wanted to ""cure"" a few villains and consequently risk his universe
3. Needed a few more scenes where the spidermen fight in unison ( we got 10 seconds of them swinging together)
4. Tobey's entrance was lame and should've been utilised during the end fight.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","thesar-2","20 December 2021","For the first time in nearly 20 years, I may have seen my favorite Spider-Man movie.And I'm not like a kid who loves the Ice Age movies and since part 17 is the newest one they've seen, it's their favorite. (Much like what they said about the 16 before it.) Nope. I sat from almost the first 10 minutes LOVING this movie and debating if this actually beat out the magnificent 2002's Spider-Man and its even better follow-up, 2004's Spider-Man 2.I will say this: This is my new 2nd favorite of ALL 27 MCU movies. Easy. And it's easily in the top three of the 10 theatrical-released Spider-Man movies. In fact, since part 2 in 2004, I have not been impressed with any of the Spider-Man movies until Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse and this third Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I barely liked Tom's Spider-Man: Homecoming and I refer to it Iron Man Jr because it was WAY more about Iron Man smarts and involvement and it clearly made Peter a complete moron who couldn't lift a finger or figure out anything on his own without big-daddy Tony helping. Tom's Spider-Man: Far From Home was better, but it still couldn't let go of Tony (EVEN after his character supposedly left the franchise.) This second rebooted version of Spider-Man of Tom Holland's made me sad, because of how dumb Peter is and how reliant he is on others, namely big-daddy Tony. This is NOT the brilliant Peter Parker I grew up with.But, FINALLY...they got it right with Tom's third movie. The trailer spoiled SO MUCH of this movie and the actors involved, as trailers are designed to be spoiler packed (usually the very last scene of the movie is in the trailer,) so I won't even go into the synopsis or what happens or who's in it. I just HIGHLY encourage you to see this ASAP and know: they FINALLY got Spider-Man right. After 5 disappointing follow-ups to Spider-Man 2, THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I laughed so hard, even though it wasn't like the traditional MCU movie where it's mostly a comedy. These were genuine jokes and not just inserted to please the audience who apparently wants more comedic MCU movies than action-packed Super-Hero movies. I cried a bit, even though it's mostly an uplifting movie. And yes, I marveled on how well acted and written this film is. Everybody gave it their 110% and no one stole scenes or out-performed anyone else. This was MY Endgame event.I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.I heard they're building a new trilogy with Tom Holland continuing his role as Spidey. To be frank, before this viewing, I almost didn't want to see them. If this turned out just slightly better than Tom's 2nd one which was just slightly better than his mediocre 1st one, I was pretty much done.Now, my Spidey-Sense is tingling to see what they have in store for us next.","

The story of the whole movie is Spiderman asks dr strange to make the world forget him. And the rest of the movie is about the villains that show up basically just joking around having fun and trying to kill Spiderman. Reacting to the story without really adding anything to it.The rest of the movie has a lot of plot holes. A whole Lot. Like for the movie to happen Spiderman has to suddenly think he can cure mental illness. And To suddenly realize that the giant lizard man was left behind in the van. Maybe we was going to go to the 7-11 and bring back a mountain dew. Who know what they were thinking. But this scene and others like it feel so forced and does not happen naturally.The spells and how they backfire make zero sense..but we could debate that all day.I feel like the most wasted opportunity was to not bring Gwen Stacy back from the dead to reunite with Garfield Spiderman. Everyone else was dead .its not a leap to say Gwen could come back too. And of Course No James Franco...a huge wasted opportunity.Overall not the best marvel movie. But not the worst.","

They have returned thanks to the multiverse, an inter-dimensional portal accessed by the stern Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) in a spell gone awry intended to restore Spider-Man's (a winning Tom Holland) anonymity after Mysterio outed Peter Parker in Spider-Man: Far From Home.The multiverse functions as a Macguffin of sorts. It's the jumping off point for Marvel movies to do what they do best, and No Way Home doesn't disappoint, thanks to that tried and true formula of good-natured banter and giddy CGI set pieces. I liked how it taps into Electro's awesome power. I kind of imagined that Electro, played by Jamie Foxx, perhaps, and this is a big perhaps, could be a crime-fighting consultant in some future movie. And Willem Dafoe gave a tortured performance as Norman Osborn, fighting hard to silence the diabolical inner voice of Green Goblin.All Marvel pictures have non-preachy messaging. No Way Home touches on grief, vengeance, and also makes a case for humanity's redemptive nature.","

After Peter Parker's identity is exposed by J Jonah Jameson.Peter seeks out Doctor Strange to return him back to anonymity. The spell goes wrong.Certain villains return, they seem to know Spiderman. He just does not know them.Taking off from the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home. This movie has a slower first act as Peter is pursued both by the media and law enforcement.When a blind lawyer shows up it is the first nod that this movie has a lot that will appeal to Spidey fans.The motivations of some of the villains look weak and confused. However it is all there for one thing. The return of the other Spidermen.Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield return with their Spidersuits and it is a punch the air moment.It really is a joy to see the merging of the previous incarnations of the Spiderman franchise. The older Tobey Maguire works well dressed as a trendy youth counsellor. Garfield has issues regarding loneliness and he might have found some closure in this film.This might be the best Spiderman movie since the Maguire era.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","aidanratesmovies","18 December 2021","It has some minor flaws here and there- but Spider-Man No Way Home is easily the best Spider-Man film to date- successfully capturing the energy and spirit of the franchises past with an entirely new direction. One of the few things I noticed while watching this film is how intimate it was with the audience. More than ever we begin to see things from Peter's point of view, and it sculpts a very touching and emotional narrative that is easily the best execution in a Marvel property in a while. While there are some small things I think they could have touched up a bit better, this film was massively entertaining, incredibly funny, and surprisingly very emotional in the best way possible. It blends the past characters so well into its story you hardly feel it's their first time in the universe. Even more, it's such a unique experience to finally see 3 generations of superhero fans unite for such an epic opportunity- of which seems more than well done- almost too good to be true at times. It may not be perfect, but personally- I loved nearly every minute of it, and can't wait to see what this franchise continues to offer down the road.My Rating: 9.5/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","cherold","1 April 2022","No Way Home starts with as much silliness as any Spider-Man movie in history. Peter Parker, unmasked, asks Doctor Strange to make everyone forget him, then hedges, then everything gets weird as a bunch of bad guys from previous Spider-Man movie series start wreaking havoc.The multiverse is, of course, a major component of Into the Spider-verse, but while that was brilliant and cool, here it comes across as profoundly silly.So in my head I was seeing this as the silliest of all Spider-man movies; a ludicrous romp with fun mindless action. And then, in a weird tonal shift, the movie gets really dark, and then tries to go back to the light-hearted bit with that hanging over it, and does some more really silly stuff, and some rather confused but fast-paced action, and then goes for a sad thing that I found kinda boring, and, well, what is this supposed to *be*.It doesn't make much sense, it's tonally chaotic, and as with the previous film, the action is fleetfully enjoyable but entirely forgettable.Still, a reasonable amount of the humor works, it's fun to see the way they play with the multiverse, and there's definitely fun to be had. But I find it perplexing how many people love this movie because to me it's a mess. It should have just stuck with silly all the way through.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","harry-34518","15 December 2021","This film has a strong story and emotional core I haven't seen too often in marvel. I laughed cried sat on the edge of my seat this film is amazing and a must watch for all marvel fans. It may not go as crazy as some will hope but this is at its centre a character piece about Peter Parker and it sets him up for a great arc. The multiverse stuff is great with many great villains coming back into the fold. There are other surprises aswell some you might be able to guess some you might not.","

This movie is brilliant on so many levels and while some may say there's too much going on in the film, I think it was almost perfect!

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","SAMTHEBESTEST","15 December 2021","Spider-Man : No Way Home (2021) -
Movie Review :The first trilogy of Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi, has a special place in everyone's heart. Tobey Maguire's Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers' Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014) and MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which made Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for the Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you love Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the years, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes it in style. But, he is not alone. This is Holland's first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still he is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas Present in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final product. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to forget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of time dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret by me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers' writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments whatsoever. Just one condition, you don't have to look for the logic because you're watching a Marvel/Sony's Superhero film, not Christopher Nolan's Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that intelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops the list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCU's Spider-Man No Way Home. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action, fantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but not the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of many Spidey fans but that's where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial potboiler, that's what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode at the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCU's most exhilarating entertainer post Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no matter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","cruise01","18 December 2021","5 out of 5 stars.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic, big, and one of the best Spider Man films of all time. Literally nothing is holding this film back which the script contains about everything. And director Jon Watts making the best spider man movie ever. Fans and non fans are going to love the film. The story is best to go without any spoilers. There are many surprises that will leave the crowd cheering. Story also goes into an emotional direction and making the film feeling like a conclusion to the trilogy. Characters story arcs coming to an end. While opening up more possibilities to where the direction can go.No Way Home does the third film of concluding the story right unlike Amazing Spider man movie or the original third film where they cram up so many villains and a story that can barely hold it together. No Way Home script managed to balance the story and characters out. This film does have several villains. A lot of returning villains that is a lot of fun surprises and even with a new look. Peter Parker facing each one of them and trying to stop them is awesome. The plot is great. It can try to go in a emotional direction. There is also a fun brief appearance of another character which is cool to see and hoping to see more of them in future mcu films someday.The action sequences are awesome and stylistic. Spider man fight scenes are amazing. The visual effects are brilliant. The cinematography is well done in capturing the action scenes. The music score is different by Michael Giacchino but great. The cast ensemble did a great job. Like I said earlier, the appearances making a return is a lot of fun. For a long run time, the film does feel short and very fast moving which keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The climax battle is epic and exciting. Spider Man facing multiple villains is one of the best action scenes ever. It can be a bit dark. The action scene with Spider Man and Doctor Strange chasing each other through the mirror dimension is stunning.Overall, No Way Home is one of the best Marvel films ever. And one of the best Spider man movies. It is big, epic, and the script and direction had a lot of surprises. I am hoping to see Jon Watts take on another Marvel project.There is a fun mid credit scene that hints for where the direction can go. And a post credit scene that hints of where mcu is going next.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Cirdl3","15 December 2021","I can't, I can't. The whole studio was screaming from the beginning until end of the movie, this movie was so perfect, Epic, Awesome and I can't even describe it. When Andrew was there I was screaming and that was making me shaking until now. The visual, edit, it's so so so good than the other MCU movie this year except Eternals cause their visuals are looks great, like a game. I still can't believe it's look like what fans theory said and fan made I can't.I really enjoyed the movie the credit scenes and everything in this movie, and it was so prefect. When Andrew was saved MJ I was really shocked, shacking, that's was epic, and everybody was like screaming exiting applause and me too HAHAHA. After I watch Spiderman I wanted to wanna cry so bad cause it was so good. I can't stop telling you guys this movie was super good 100/10, 10/10 I really wanna watch it again. And venom part I thought he was going to help or fight the Spiderman, but he gave a venom liquid to the MCU. This movie was one of the saddest MCU movies I feel so sad when aunt may died, and everyone forget about Peter Parker. At the end Peter Parker was made a new suit and the suit it's really looked like the other Spiderman movie or the game which is super wholesome. This is so on fire!!!!!.After I've watch this 3 times and there's some scene that don't make any sense but this movie still so so so good... like when the girl from MIT open her seatbelt and when the car want to fell down, she used the seatbelt.Edit : I've been thinking about this like a month I think no way home VFX it's not that good I mean some of theme it was really look like a fan made edits.In the end Spiderman No Way Home, it such a wholesome Christmas movie and serve fantastic fans services, with great storytelling, visual, acting, and cinematography.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","diegosays","16 December 2021","This film... it's going to be the topic of every conversation for the years to come.Obviously, we all kinda expected what was going to happen in this movie.Yet, we all wanted to see it with our own eyes.And it did happen:
THREE SPIDER-MAN'S! That were brought together in the same universe after Dr. Strange erroneously cast a dangerous spell.(We needed an excuse for this to happen, of course)
My personal review here:
I'll be honest, I never was much of a fan of Holland's Spider-Man. The reason I went to see this film was because my inner child needed to see with his own eyes, the possibility of Tobey and Andrew coming back.And, yes. I cried like a baby the moment I watched the Spider-Man from my childhood meeting the Spider-Man from my adolescence.This was VERY beautiful to watch.For a second I even sobbed.But then... something was left.It felt as if the writers did not know what to do with the three ""Spider-Men"" after putting them all together.After that huge moment, that made us all scream and clap, it didn't take long till the dialogue started to feel dumb, with fan service jokes or even about their own movies as Spider-Man.Like, ""yeah, you are the second one"".The moment I saw Tobey, Andrew and Tom together, I thought:
""Oh my god, this is going to be epic af""
""This will probably be the most important film of our generation"".But, by the end of the third act, I realized:
They did it again...
They took the characters we've loved since we were kids to put them in a millionaire project with a really bad script.Repeating Raimi's mistake. They put so many villains that they didn't know what to do with them, not even with three Spider-Man's.The movie started to feel rushed after that. Causing plot holes, lack of emotions or a good dialogue between each Spider-Man and the enemy from his own universe.(Tobey Maguire sees Norman Osborn ALIVE again and he doesn't say a word to him?)
(Tobey Maguire sees Otto Octavius ALIVE again and they only exchange two words as if they had seen each other at Home Depot)
They gave us a cheapie 20 minute fight where they must ""cure"" every single villain with a magical injection? With barely any good or lasting scenes from each Spider-Man.Not to mention the horrific way Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield just ""vanished"", going back to their respective universes.The movie only lasts two hours and a half. Would it have been so difficult to add 30 more minutes of the three Spider-Man's in action?We barely saw Maguire or Garfield fighting or do anything else before that terrible goodbye.And by the way, what happened to Tobey Maguire? And I'm not talking about his age, I'm talking about how unexpressive and autistic he looks and talks in this movie.Was that scripted?My final words in this review:
Seeing the old Spider-Man's on the big screen again was something too beautiful, but it wasn't ""epic"".But it could have been.It could've been the most glorious movie we ever saw in our lives...
But, the film industry does not focus on good stories nowadays.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","MiroslavKyuranov","15 December 2021","It's...I'm still trying to realize what I've seen, but I've seen things I didn't think I'd ever see on the big screen! We all know that spoilers have been on the internet for more than a year, but apart from the things we thought, there are a lot of other things and of course I won't spoil anything, but...the film pulls very thin string from our emotions and it worked perfectly!The story is solid, it's not just fan service, which was one of my fears, there are explanations for everything. Holland grows in front our eyes with this role and this is one of the many pleasant aspects of the film. Strange's role is important (not a big shock).The villains are...I felt like a kid watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series again...I don't even know where to start. The film has more than a big stake and in some places you stand on the edge of your seat.The action scenes are the best I've ever seen in a Spidey movie and are generally among the best in comicbook movies! There are so many well-coordinated scenes, that after the movie you will want to watch them again and again.There are a lot of dialogues that hit the emotions really hard and that will be quoted long after the movie. In some places you even want the villains to prevail, because it looks so good and you want more and more and more...There are comedic moments of course, most of which well placed, but compared to the previous two films, this one is much darker and more serious. Like I said, Spidey is growing up, and that's tangible. There are a lot of surprises, some smaller, others bigger, but the movie certainly deserves more than one watch with friends. The hall was exploding! (Endgame vibes).Michael Giacchino's music, as always, is remarkable. The classic Spidey soundtrack mixed with some darker elements is a delight for the ears.Open your eyes on four, because there are a lot of references, some more tangible than others, but hardcore fans will be more than happy with what they saw.Knowing that this movie leads straight to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness...you better prepare for the unexpected!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","SnoopyStyle","25 January 2022","It's immediately after the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Spider-Man (Tom Holland) had been framed by Mysterio who also revealed his true identity, Peter Parker. He and his friends, MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon), are hounded by the media, demonized by many, and investigated by the authorities. Frustrated with his situation, he asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to do a spell.This Spider group is a fun group. I love this young group and then there are the veterans. It's a great way to reincorporate the previous Spider-verses and the bonus is getting all these great veteran actors. They are all great at delivering complex characters. There is a bit of redemption for some who ended the previous versions on a down note. This is a good movie by itself as well as a good progression for the MCU.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","sharky_55","23 December 2021","Tobey Maguire's trilogy remains indelible, from its origin story, the pitch-perfect sequel, and the messy conclusion. It has Raimi written all over it, and even at its worst moments, the least you could dub it is memorable. The follow-up series doesn't have that same appeal, but Garfield's charisma shines through, as it similarly does here. Conversely, Holland's rendition has always felt a little cut-and-paste from its surrounding universe, unable to separate itself from the whimsy and bathos of the MCU. This Peter Parker's one-liners are drawn from the same snarky persona as Iron Man, Star-Lord, War Machine, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man...the list goes on. I've made my peace with it. It isn't a new criticism, and could be levelled at most films post-Phase One. But it's always felt limiting in terms of crafting distinct character (and filmic) voices and undermining attempts at sentimentality. Let's start with Cumberbatch's Strange. He's stepping into the mentor role post-Endgame but he's never been given a meaningful opportunity to develop his own philosophy on the character, let alone a voice. Sans his solo film, the premise of the Sorcerer Supreme makes him a convenient plot device to facilitate the adventures of other superheroes. Listen to his dialogue here; it's always delivered at a distance, drenched in cynicism, as if it's afraid of fully buying into the idea of a connection. Cumberbatch seems to be constantly setting up the next punchline, and so even if this abrasive back-and-forth elicits laughs, it never builds to anything genuine, rendering the climatic callback (obvious from a mile away) into a deflated attempt at growth and recognition. Yes, RDJ addressed Holland in the same way, but there was history and a relationship there. There's an inherent self-consciousness to the way that Feige and co. Craft the MCU's humour, so relentlessly wary of losing the audience for more than a second that they keep sincerity at an arm's length. Observe how the entire film just grinds to a halt for the Spidey's stand-up routine atop the Statue of Liberty scaffolding; the trialogue isn't written for the characters, it's written for the fans to play spot the reference (""You're amazing. I want to hear you say it.""). Marvel would never in a million years allow their Spider-Man to be the butt of the joke, or freeze-frame on his goofy smile over 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'. He's too cool for that.This universe's Peter Parker and his defining Spider-Man moment is how he reacts to losing his Uncle Ben, but the crux of its emotional impact rests on what has already been established. What do we really know about this version of Aunt May, anyway? No, not what we surmise and assume based on the previous actions of the mentor archetype, but her as an actual person. How much screentime has Tomei been afforded here and in the first two films that isn't delegated to punchlines about her hotness or her apparent fling with Happy? You need to earn the right to drop that iconic line about responsibility; the words don't hold any weight in and of themselves. What does follow her death works in pushing Peter into newer and darker territory for this Spider-Man, and Holland is finally asked to consider the interiority of his character and how these circumstances might actually damage the psyche of a teenager. After all, what was the complication of Far From Home beyond mopping up the external mess of an Avengers-level threat? Here, Peter must contend with the consequences of his actions (the film initially made me balk at the idea of resetting the universe just so a few teens could get accepted into their college of choice, and then cleverly flips that on its head) and ultimately assume the burden and emotional baggage that comes with being a superhero. The rooftop scene where Maguire and Garfield confess of their own failures and futile quests for vengeance is unlike anything even the MCU is capable of; it's not merely a crossover, but a character speaking across generations to itself, pleading for this Peter to avoid repeating their past mistakes. It leans pretty hard on the audience having that pre-knowledge; you need to know the stories they refer to in order to buy into the emotion, but for those who do, it's genuinely affecting.So Peter completes his mission and manages to do justice to Aunt May's final wish, but what of the 'villains'? The other core theme of the film, beyond Peter's grappling with his grief and the value of revenge, is the idea of second chances being afforded to those who deserve them (who, in Aunt May's world, is everyone). Yet how much of this actually rings true for each member of the Spidey rogues gallery dragged in from the multiverse? Norman and Otto are afforded the most agency as a result of their characters' redemption being more or less pre-ordained. They don't need 'fixing', just a removal of that corruptive influence and a reversion to their original selves. But what of the others? Electro is stripped of his powers and therefore his bloodlust, makes a brief quip referencing Miles Morales, and then is returned to live life as his pre-superpowered, nerdy outcast self. What lesson does he learn? Sandman, as one of the relatively more sympathetic villains of the Spideyverse, was already redeemed at the end of his chapter and never even died at the hands of Spider-Man, so his appearance here is puzzling, reduced once more to an angry CGI spectacle that hits things (Thomas Haden Church receives all of 20 seconds of screentime, with the rest of his stay in sand form). Peter may take responsibility for mistakes made and change himself for good, but how much of this change transfers over to those he impacted? It's a little too neat of a thematic bow to tie all these different arcs together in the name of redemption. The action itself is fine, inoffensive; the climactic battle starts off poorly for the Spideys, before Holland gives a pep talk about teamwork and they then execute a series of pre-planned, carefully choreographed moves in front of a blue screen, only this time it works! There's nothing actually revealed about leadership or teamwork here, but we don't care; we just want that master shot of their superhero landings. It's screensaver material.Legacy is key here: that of this live-action universe across three generations of the webslinger, of the characters within their worlds, and of the films themselves. It's now nigh impossible to engage with this franchise without consuming each and every chapter of its storytelling, an increasingly mammoth task that grows with each phase, miniseries, and cinematic event. You can't just view them as one-offs; you need to buy in and subscribe and devote time to tracking and keeping tabs on its chronology. Your reward is the payoff for this dedication; you know that character, you know the event that they are referencing when it comes up on the big screen. Garfield's Peter is forced to relive the same moment that led to Gwen's death during his rescue of MJ, and fans can recognise the trauma it induces and how significant and moving it is for him to be able to save her this time round. Other fans, however, from the looks of internet reaction videos, seem to be cheering in recognition of this. Is that not emblematic of the two camps of MCU takes in conflict with each other? I'm unsure whether they can or should be conflated. In 2012, when the MCU was still in its infancy, Ebert wrote this of The Avengers: ""It provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable."" I think we do deserve these films. We've supported the franchise from its early rocky beginnings, and we've been there every step of the way in its evolution into a cultural giant. I experienced my own payoff, as millions around the world did, seeing Avengers Endgame almost a decade later as each character stepped out of their portals, the goosebumps on my arm as close to something quantifiable for that feeling of awe and yes, recognition. What lies in future for this franchise, and what is (if there are any plans for, commercial or otherwise) its endgame? I didn't feel anything of that calibre watching No Way Home, but I think it still sticks its landing. Having sacrificed his own relationships to fix the mess that emerged from his faults, Holland returns to where I think Peter Parker truly belongs: in a run-down apartment, landlord berating him for the rent, once again alone with only his suit for company. But there's a reason why the most important scenes are always shot with the mask off. This is where the core and heart of the character resides, and what Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Verse understood so well: the power was never a choice, but accepting the responsibility that comes with it is. Holland's Peter finally makes that choice, and in doing so unveils the human behind the mythos of the superhero. No nanotech or Instant-Kill Mode could ever make up for that.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","drawlife","16 December 2021","Where to begin? I would find it extremely difficult for any Spider-Man fan to dislike this film. What's amazing is the feat that Jon Watts, Kevin Feige, Amy Pascal and others accomplished here.Let me just say the the plot has a lot of mumbo jumbo, comic-book logic that typically most comic fans can get on board with including myself, but because the MCU has built enough trust with everyone, you just kinda go with it. Even if you don't, the magic of all these actors and legacy characters returning for this dazzling spectacle will kinda make you forgive it.Lets also just get this out of the way. It was the worst kept secret that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were appearing alongside Tom Holland. The consensus on this was pretty much acknowledged to almost every fanboy, fangirl and most casual fans too. Also the return of Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, Thomas Haden Church's Sandman and Rhys Ifans' Lizard made it more apparent. It's just a marvel(pun intended) that Sony and Marvel/Disney were able to bring everyone back. Never would I have thought it was possible.The villains are a lot more poignant and prominent than I thought they would be. Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe are THE MVPs of the bunch. Dafoe is used to great effect and is as menacing as I remember him and Molina commands the screen with his presence and delivery. They still feel very much in tune with what Sam Raimi did. Jamie Foxx has a second chance with Electro and it works a lot more now than it did since the last time we saw him in 2014. Unfortunately Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans are the benchwarmers of the villains. BUT, used to some capacity where they don't feel totally left out.Now lets talk about the Spider-Men.TOM HOLLAND: I think Marvel Studios and Sony either had this planned all along or they heard the fans and listened. What I loved about Holland/MCU's iteration is that he is kid who brings his exciting energy and youthful enthusiasm to the Avengers. Also as fan of Spidey comics, particularly the Ultimate Spider-Man series, I feel most of the best stories is when he's a teenager in high school. So I got what I wanted in that regard, however my criticism of his portrayal is that he was basically Iron Man Jr. With a lot of Stark tech. But here, they strip him down, beat him to a pulp, he loses his Aunt May, makes sacrifices and learns from his mistakes. He finally learns and understands with the help of Tobey and Andrew providing their wisdom. I think finally we are going to get the Spider-Man that we hoped he would grow into. It is Holland's best performance as the character by far.ANDREW GARFIELD: Jon Watts and his writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers redeem him. Not that his portrayal was bad, because personally I always found Garfield's Spider-Man the most accurate of the bunch and there are some things to like about the Marc Webb films. Garfield gets the closure he needed as his movies ended abruptly after the 2014 sequel. Every moment he has where he shares his experience with Holland and Maguire on screen is a major highlight. Especially when he talks about Gwen Stacy. He also has a nice moment where he saves Zendaya's MJ, mirroring the fact that he never got to save Gwen. Garfield absolutely crushed it and displayed his amazing acting chops.TOBEY MAGUIRE: For many, including myself Tobey Maguire is the OG. Growing up with his Spider-Man films, words can't really describe the emotions I felt seeing him back. I was practically reliving my childhood the minute he appeared. It was all coming back to me, being on the hype train during his era of films and just obsessing over the Sam Raimi films, it just brought me back. I truly felt like a kid again. Tobey's presence in the film feels very much like the older brother of the group and he bounces off Holland and Garfield seamlessly. It's been a hot minute seeing Tobey on the big screen since PAWN SACRIFICE(good movie by the way) and he hasn't lost a step.Once Garfield and Maguire appear, all three share the limelight as co-leads and not a single one of them feel left out.As for the rest of the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch always commands your attention. I was initially turned off of the idea of having Holland's Spidey have another mentor like figure, but here Strange and Spidey are at odds on how to handle their problem after the botched spell. So that was a nice surprise in the marketing and in the film. Marisa Tomei has way more to do in this film than the previous films and has an emotional send off with her death. Zendaya's MJ has grown on me since FAR FROM HOME and Jacob Batalon's Ned is less annoying here which I appreciated.Piggy backing off that, I did admire that Watts aimed for a more mature tone throughout the film. As I get older I do crave that serious tone a bit more and I savor it every time it is present. I mean yes the standard formulaic humor is still present, but I appreciated every moment where things got serious.I love the MCU and I'm always there to watch their product, but I can be honest and say that at times, they are like comfort food. I know what I'm getting and I know I'll enjoy it. I also haven't been shy of the films I've really disliked, but they have been consistent as a whole. However, when they either take big swings or assemble(pun intended) a film with a more mature tone, every so often we'll get absolute gems like the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy, the first AVENGERS, the first GUARDIANS, and INFINITY WAR. I'm extremely pleased that SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME belongs with those gems. Should Sony and Marvel/Disney keep working together I look forward to more adventures as the Spider-Man I wanted Tom Holland to be. I would also be lying to you if I didn't crave more of Garfield and Maguire. Anything is possible nowadays as we even got a Charlie Cox's Daredevil cameo, which was also heavily speculated and if you've been keeping up with HAWKEYE, you know we're in for a treat.While the story can be cluttered, the film drives it home with the development of Holland's Spider-Man, some excellent performances, and fan service with a purpose. Definitely the best MCU Spider-Man film, one of my favorite MCU entries as a whole, and in the conversation of one of the best Spidey films with Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2 and INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE.9.5/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Thanos_Alfie","17 December 2021","""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is an Action - Fantasy movie and the third movie of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise, in which we follow the story of Spider-Man after ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"". Everybody knows the true identity of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange can help Peter with a spell. Everything change when this spell goes wrong.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an amazing plot, contained plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. Regarding the plot, there were some plot twists that I did not expect so, it was a nice surprise and something that made the movie even more interesting and enjoyable. The direction which was made by Jon Watts was very good and he used wisely both information and characters to create this special movie. The interpretations of Tom Holland who played as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Alfred Molina who played as Dr. Otto Octavius / Doc Ock, Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Doctor Strange and Willem Dafoe who played as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin were simply fantastic and their combination worked very well and created an outstanding result. All in all, I have to say that ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" is one of the best Marvel movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","namob-43673","15 December 2021","Updated with spoilers:
This is the spider-man movie to see. This is the love child of the entire MCU. The action is fantastic, everything is great, and there is so many brilliant callbacks and wonderful nostalgia mixed with love, emotions and great acting. For the first 40min or so this is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with Daredevil cameo as the top of the line - and I loved this move, however it has a few errors that lower the score and the longer the movie goes the less I enjoyed it which is kinda strange since the ending is spectacular and Amazing.The CGI is not always on point. Those computer graphic misses stod out was because it is excellent otherwise, so kinda weird with a few misses. I think the Sandman was badly done and The Lizard was a joke. I also seriously dislike Peter decision to try to save everyone and the fight with Strange. That is where the movie almost lost me. And these are clearly evil people, and they died in their respective universe. But okay, the plot does need to happen... The worst thing though is why them? In all the universes, of all the people that know who Peter is, these are the ones coming through? Why not 97 of Uncle Ben's? That would make more sense. My final complaint is that all that comes before comes to Peter is now erased, which is fine and a great hero sacrifice, but it also create issues with continuity and storylines.The great awesomeness is all the rest. The music score is amazing, best since Captain Marvel (which, no matter what you thought of that movie, has the best original score of any superhero movie). And the Flashpoint? Haha.. great stuff. The action is spectacular, the script amazing, all the actors do an fantastic job with Willem Dafoe probably stealing the acting crown. Two end-credit scenes, although I heard some saw a long ""trailer"", which I did not see so felt that was kinda weird, perhaps only in some theatres? The first meh, kinda cool I guess. The second about something I care nothing about with a character I care absolutely nothing about so kinda disappointing to me. I am not going to see Dr Strange II, I really dislike Wanda and I dislike Elizabeth Olsen portrait of her even less. That TV show was the worst I have ever seen, except for Batwoman.. nothing is worse than Batwoman... That Strange movie will suck.Despite my criticism this movie is together with the current running Hawkeye show (which is fantastic) I feel like the MCU is still alive and kicking. And with Daredevil and Kingpin now part of the MCU, can be worse for sure. This movie really take hold of you and give you that magic which the best superhero movies do. I would rank this as the second best Spider-Man movie and top 10 for sure within the MCU. 8/10 and I highly recommend.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Leofwine_draca","16 July 2022","I'm no fan of the SPIDER-MAN films with Tom Holland; I find them way too kiddified and the humour just jars with me. But I can comfortably say that this is the best of the trilogy, and that's because it feels fresher and different to the rest. I loved the recall of old villains, it was great to see Foxx, Molina and Dafoe come back again and it's clear they're having fun. Cumberbatch is good in a limited role too. Best of all are Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who light up the screen and make all of their scenes delightful; they show up Holland, that's for sure. The rest is your usual mish mash of CGI action complete with an excruciatingly overblown and sentimental ending (please!).","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","El-Ak","15 December 2021","I just watched the movie at the theatre and you really don't wanna miss this one out. I will make it simple, the movie will live to your expectations If not exceed them, however, during the first half of the film you won't witness anything new. Every fight scene is in the trailer and I LITREALLY mean every fight scene. But don't get me wrong they were awesome and of course not the whole fight scenes. It's also full of talking and a bit more funny lines than usual. You also have a very very silly plot that was based on some character's opinion and lead to all the events of the film and then comes on of the best plots and entrances near the beginning of the second half that you will ever witness and here comes the second half of the movie and trust me it was beyond awesome. The VFX of this film is breathtaking. Every action sequence is very complicated and loaded with tons of details. The visuals are insaaane. You also have a couple of Spidy suits and most importantly you won't be disappointed with anything you might be expecting. You have Dr. Strange and believe me it was one of the best times you will see him along with another hero cause Benedict is such a great actor. Zendaya role however was meaningless but you know she is Spidy's GF. The Finale of the film is beyond great and feels like a dream come true for all fans around the world that will leave you full of emotions, amazed and shocked! Even the two post credit scenes made everyone yell in the theatre (who yelled for more than half of the movie). Not a perfect movie and a lot of things may not make sense and will make your brain full of questions like Endgame and that's what make a movie a great one. I have now experienced the whole trilogy at the theatre and there is no doubt that this one is the best. I hope you just relax and enjoy it cause as a fan I'd give it a 10/10 easily but a solid 9/10 with love and joy is fair enough.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","lakings97","29 December 2021","Spider-man: No Way Home continues where Far From Home had ended when Spider-man's identity is revealed. In order to reverse his publicity as Peter Park, he enlists the help of Dr. Strange played Benedict Cumberbatch. The spell doesn't work exactly as planned and opens a window into alternative universes that collide all the villains and Spider-Man's together much like Spider-man Into the Spider-verse. William Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church revise their mischievous ways but Holland's version of our friendly neighborhood spider-man uses Stark's technology to help each one from being killed from their own universes. Tom, Zendaya and Jacob bring together the other Spider-man reprised by Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. Marisa Tomei added a level of support, love and emotion to the point that we all cherish. The story showed a unique perspective of Spider-man that we haven't seen in any of the other films. I loved this one, one of my favorite Marvel movies ever, it was filled with empathy, adventure, pure emotional ride. I could watch this one over and over again. Add this one to your library.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","pughspencer","11 August 2022","Not only is this one of the best MCU films, its debatably the best Spider-Man film. It no doubt feels like a love letter to how far the Spider-Man films have come. This film wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for many things like the MCU setting up their own Spidey and Doctor Strange as well as everything that happened in all the previous Spider-Man films. It's fan service but the fan service has purpose to be there. But underneath all the fun callbacks it's still a damn good Spider-Man story. Tom Holland to me is the best live action Spider-Man we've had so far and he's come such a long way. From taking orders from Tony Stark in Civil War to now giving the orders to two other Spider-Men really is an achievement for him. The movie even fixes things many have had problems with. Not just for him but for other things too like how much of William Dafoe's performance as the Green Goblin we missed when he had to wear that helmet in the first Raimi Spider-Man movie. There's so many incredible moments in this movie id never thought id see one day. From Spider-Man defeating Doctor Strange with math to Aunt May's tragic death to watching all three Spider-Men swing together and do science was such a treat. It has almost everything I could want in a Spider-Man flick.The only negative I have for the film is the mid credit scene with Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom. I'm not a fan of those films as I don't like the direction they took this Eddie Brock and Venom. Having him jump to the MCU & than jump back to his own universe was just a waste of time & this whole Marvel Studios having to share the rights with Sony thing is just getting so obnoxious. I really hope they get the full rights back from Sony so these dumb villian spinoff movies can die before it gets even worse.Still it didn't ruin my experience with this highly entertaining flick. It's one of those movies I can watch for hours and never get bored🖤","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","iamianiman","15 December 2021","NO SPOILERS!Everything that has been previously built has led up to this and tens to hundreds of theories have been speculated and lo and behold, this is so much better than Endgame. Though most of the theories aren't true, but it's impressive to witness the fact that it lives up to all the hype. Sheer madness!Without spoiling anything, No Way Home opens umpteenth of possibilities for new plots and world-building in that the next Spiderman trilogy or Marvel films, anything and everything can happen or exist beyond a shadow of a doubt.Mystical and mysterious, this most anticipated film of the year provides a plot that is rarely seen in the superhero cinematic landscape. It's exciting, refreshing and breaking new grounds insofar that it's unpredictable as it keeps on searching for new angles to entice both the old and new generations.People may get disconnected with the plot because it involves time and magic. However, what's so great about No Way Home is in the friendly tone and weight that they present to the audience, making it easy to understand even coming from someone who is not a huge fan of superhero films.Tom Holland powerfully brings everything here to the table. His range of acting and emotional skills has improved tremendously since the predecessor. Even for someone who despises him, you'll be knocking yourself off your feet in no time!Compared to other origin films that opts for typical storytelling, No Way Home attempts to balance humor, drama and action all in one movie and oh my, how it succeeds at that is just one huge jaw-dropping spectacle.As revealed in the trailer, there are plenty of villains await and everyone has a screentime just or almost as much as the others. No one is in the spotlight too little or too much, resulting in an appropriate amount of sheer greatness to introduce back all the bad guys.There are a lot of jokes to spot in this film. However, some of them offer subtlety and puns that you can see it coming only by the help of your own experience and intelligence. Only when you see the film, you'll understand what I'm saying.Never have I seen such a beautiful but haunting ending before. I don't wanna say much here but the ending alone is a masterpiece that it feels like it's coming from an Oscar-worthy film and I'm not exaggerating even one bit.The one thing I dislike here with No Way Home is its cheesiness during the first half. It projects this parody-like vibe that somehow takes us out of the experience a little bit. Even I get a tingling sense that the cameras are just too lazy to shoot the movie.The 2 post-credits scenes are good and exciting but I feel like it doesn't live the hype to all the existing theories on the web. Good but nothing shocking.Verdict: Within 150 minutes, Spiderman No Way Home offers a rollercoaster ride of a thousand of emotions, similar to Infinity War & Endgame and it is definitely the best Marvel origin stand-alone film to date.","

Now, I know nobody wants spoilers so without going into any detail whatsoever I just want to say, believe the hype because this exceeds it, usually I don't want to get people over excited for something but this has to be watched, it is 20 years of Spider-Man all put into one film that manages to feel like the perfect culmination of all that history, my only criticism is that there couldn't be a Stan Lee cameo because if he had still been with us today he would have loved this.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","eddie_baggins","16 December 2021","THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW!There's not much chance of devoted Spidey/Marvel fans walking away from Jon Watt's and Tom Holland's latest web-slinging adventure without a strong sense of satisfaction from an epic outing, that in many ways feels as grand and risky as when the world first wondered how Marvel would manage to bring The Avengers to life all the way back in 2012.The third trip between director Watt's and his leading man, that sees the groundwork laid before it combine here in a loaded and fan servicing collaboration, to talk about No Way Home without giving away its many narrative treasures and likely iconic pop culture moments is a difficult task but there's reason to believe even early on in its release that this Spider-Man outing will go down as one of, if not the best big screen solo outings for the local neighborhood vigilante yet.As is always the case with such loaded Marvel outings, there are a few narrative conveniences that don't hold up to much examination and a few half-explored ideas but too dwell on these moments would be a waste of ones time when there's so much joy, fun and even unexcepted emotion to be found in Watt's film as Parker and his offsiders find themselves battling a severe multiverse problem that threatens to derail the world as we know it.Filled with an abundance of action set pieces, well-known Marvel comedic beats, more throwbacks and nods to lore than almost any other Marvel film before it and fun character interactions, what is perhaps most surprising of all about this high reaching adventure is the wealth of strong performances found within it from one of the most stacked casts the long running superhero brand has seen yet.From the expected and unexpected cast additions, everyone here brings their A-game with Holland and Zendaya as the loving couple getting great moments together and feeling well and truly like they've both become their respective characters in body and soul, while other returning cast members from both recent and less recent times all appear to care more than just a paycheck collection would suggest giving No Way Home a strong sense of purpose and heart, with the small moments making more of an impact than the films various action oriented segments.Likely to be a film that is explored multiple times and one that is sure to provide hidden moments of joy and satisfaction to those that delve back into it across the ensuing years, No Way Home is another groundbreaking achievement from Marvel who could've easily sat back and enjoyed their success after the events of Endgame but have continued to push the boundaries of blockbuster movie making as they keep looking to provide us with top notch entertainment that is undeniable and unmatched in quality.Final Say -There's no doubt about the fact that Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest and arguably best Spider-Man outing yet. A stunning achievement in pushing forward while also acknowledging the past, things here might not be perfect but there's too much to like here to deny that Marvel has once more raised the bar for the comic book cinematic landscape.4 imprisoned trees out of 5Check out my film blog Jordan and Eddie for more reviews!","

The film is very moving and exciting and the characters are all there so you can't tell them anything. The plot based on healing the baddies and not defeating them is quite original even if it has a meaningless beginning. For the rest this negative film has that the dialogues are disgusting for most of the film and the villains are not managed so well, but it is overcome because in the end the film lives up to expectations and with an exaggeration of fan service.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","cthirlby","15 December 2021","Wow what a ride and such an experience. As a big Spider-Man fan I got a surprising few things from this movie too. First of all they stuck with the villains stories no matter the reception they got on the previous films they stuck with it and that's honestly so respectful. To see not all of them actually be villains because Peter is trying to help them from themselves by not dying was the Spider-Man I have been hoping to see from Tom Holland which I didn't feel in the other movies. Green Goblin is easily the most terrifying how he pretends to be on Peters side and tries to manipulate Peter and May. Lizard wasn't in it much but hey he was still good in the movie. Sandman was awesome, he protected Peter from Electro after the events of Spider-Man 3 and just wanted to be with his daughter. Electro was fun and fresh too with his new look and the visuals. Doc Ock obviously amazing and to hear the call backs to Spider-Man 2, so happy they didn't make him a villain and he actually helped them. Second of all Aunt May being Peters ""Uncle Ben"" was amazing, she delivered the line perfectly and she was just great especially since we had more screen time with her in these movies than we did with Ben in the others. Thirdly Matt Murdock! Are you kidding me! A very small part but wow it's good to see him again looking great and I can't wait to see what they do with that character. Fourthly Andrew and Tobey of course... Andrew coming through that portal and being not quite sure if it was him until he came forward was unreal everyone went mad in the cinema (Same with Tobey) he is still great after years, Tobey amazing too they just hold a special place in a lot of peoples hearts and their interactions with the characters especially Peter (Toms) Just very impactful and maybe they will come back who knows. 5th point is that in the portal coming through we saw Kraven and a Rhino variant and I wanted them to come but who knows... overall they ended the film great with the villains not having to die. Final points I'll say is that Green Goblin vs Peter was pretty brutal, it was intense and Tobey stopping Peter from killing him was just so perfect. My last final point is that ending... Peter having to leave everything behind to keep them safe was the Spider-Man we all know and love. Him getting an apartment struggling to get by and being Spider-Man still with a comic accurate suit and not an iron spider suit. This is the Spider-Man I have wanted and I can't wait to see what they will do. The ending made me think of the game for the PS4/5 and if they go down that route of tone and stuff then this could be some of the best Spider-Man movies coming up. No gadgets, just Spider-Man and Peter Parker being their natural selves and the heroes we all love. Overall this film is something else and I'm glad I was there to see it, it's a good laugh, it's a good thrill and it's Spider-Man. Thank you to everyone who made this film!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","olliechowes","19 December 2021","The anticipation for the movie was second to only Avengers: Endgame. So naturally I was expecting big things, and trust me, it didn't disappoint.I found myself, throughout the film and the days after watching it, trying and failing to pin my thoughts down and give it a score out of 10. This is likely due to the amalgamation of so many previous characters, spanning from 2002-2021 through multiple movies and franchises. This was not a negative, but rather something to be very, very excited about and nervous of how it would be handled. I was scared of a clear villain not being established, however Willem Defoe's Green Goblin was expertly presented as 'the baddie'. Peter is haunted by him after the death of Aunt May, and his iconic, almost Joker-esque laugh gave him a real villainous tone.I can't write a spoilers review without talking about the other Spider-men. The relationship between the three Peter's is everything every Spider-man fan has ever wanted, from their hilarious conversations about web shooters and aliens to their instant connection over the loss of their loved ones. I could not help but laugh at the simplicity yet complication of it all, it's just three different Peter's, yet 20 years in the making. A side note, does this mean that the MCU started in 2002?The basic plot for this film is something new for Spider-man. And while it works very well, it did keep me asking questions about Doctor Strange's abilities. Could he have made everyone forget about the clip that Mysterio made instead of listening to Peter's suggestion? Surely he's smart enough to know that Peter wouldn't want everyone to forget? This line of logic is the main fault with this film. Specifically towards the end when every universe is about to raid Peter's and he suggests to just recast the original spell. Films in which the main character suddenly comes up with some form of solution at the end undermines the entire movie.Tom Holland takes the role of Spider-man in a different way than Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire did. Throughout his first trilogy, he doesn't ""change"" into Spider-man, he essentially stays as Peter even when he's in the suit. This helped bring Peter alive and give us a much more realistic representation of the character. He also doesn't have as much of a problem of balancing lives like Maguire did, or a problem with his Uncle Ben for that matter (Who isn't even mentioned by Holland's Parker after Maguire's Parker explains how he lost him). His adorable geekiness and lovable lightheartedness make this film not only a brilliant Spider-man movie, but a brilliant Peter Parker movie too.","

The movie full of nostalgic and emotional scenes. The movie that connects all the generations together and makes a perfect ending to all the three Spider-Man franchises. In the end, this is an another masterpiece from Marvel, with the best fighting scenes I've ever seen in my life, with the best Picture, the best CGI and the best acting so far.

I especially like the parts where 3 spidermans comes together as a team, Tobey and Andrew becoming the big brothers and providing the much needed guidance to Tom. Tobey even acting as the senior most and guiding Andrew through relationships and the best part Tobey putting himself between Tom and goblin to prevent Tom from running into the path of vengeance. I've seen the movie twice in 12 hours but couldn't shake the emotions I felt for the three of them the first time. The end kinda felt like we're saying our goodbyes to all three of them, which is a massive tear jerker, it also felt Miles Morales, Gwen Stacy will be stepping into the sony universe of spiderman pretty soon.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","JoelChamp85","25 April 2022","First half is almost unbearable with Peter's friends and family taking larger roles than previous films, they just don't cut it. The comedy misses it's mark and the emotional scenes have no impact. The only good supporting character in first half is Dr. Strange. But, the second half does redeem the film somewhat. This is probably one of the weakest in the franchise.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","garethvk","15 December 2021","Life for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is complicated thanks to his dual life as Spider-Man and the challenges of being in High School. Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"".Taking place where ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.As if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.Desperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.Strange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).Strange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.As more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.What follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.The film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.The film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.While there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.There is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.","

The actors are constantly winking at the audience like some tired vaudeville act. The acting was atrocious. The story atrocious. More mixed up morality. I'm not the only one. I've spoken to several friends that turned it off after five minutes.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","PedroPires90","15 December 2021","NO SPOILERS - The first act is a mess saved by some familiar faces and one or two funny scenes. However, with the first emotional event of the film, everything changes. First, with a lot of fan service and some weird changes on the tone (I still don't get how MCU wants everybody to move from crying a lot to laughing hard in the next minute), but always growing to a very strong third act on an epic battle (even if slightly confusing).There are problems. The fan service - already mentioned - is simply too much. It's not only what you are thinking. It's remembering all the single moments you can imagine, it's in a lot of dialogue, lots of lines and mostly is there only to tell you ""hey, I'm here, remember?"". But what works mainly as a gimmick supports a very good emotional arc, which happens for the first time on this trilogy. This also helps Holland and Zendaya, who are now better actors and have time to show what they can bring to the table.It's not a perfect film. It's still behind the first two of Maguire but I hope they can keep on this way.PS: The humour is still an issue, but a bit less than on the previous ones.","

We really miss the original spider man who was so common yet so special. Being spider man was so special! In this movie, With so many superheroes sometimes it is hard to ascertain whether you are watching Avengers, Doctor strange , Spiderman or some other marvel movies. Spider man is just another person.The original spider man was so special, he had a sweet grandmother, a girl friend, he went to college , he liked milk and cake , he celebrated Christmas, yet he could cast a web.In this movie he simply is not so common anymore, by giving him too many powers , you disconnect him from humans and associate him with something else.We don't feel that that the guy we meet down the street could be that anonymous spiderman.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mtmetcalfe","22 December 2021","The action is great. It was fun seeing all the villains. Defoe is excellent. There was also some really heartfelt dramatic moments. I did like the ending. But...
PROBLEM 1:The whole genesis of the problems that Peter Parker faces is a complete betrayal of Dr. Stranges character. There is no way in hell he would gamble with the fate of the universe to cast this spell for Peter. Know matter how bad he wants things to be better for Peter.PROBLEM 2: Now all of a sudden we can cure evil in our villains?! I found this to be ridiculous. Complete incompetence of Peter to just not hit the button and send these villains back to their universe. Way too much of a gamble to just keep all the villains around while he creates some drugs to cure mental illness.","

It was amazing to see all the villains from the previous movies return and the chemistry between Toby, Andrew and Tom was not only hilarious but genuine and fantastic. They really listened to the fans on the one. Toby and Andrew have much bigger parts than I expected which made this movie for me. When they showed up in the movie the cinema absolutely erupted. It was a very special moment - one guy in my row was crying. Not to mention Dr Strange is not only brilliant in this movie but also has a huge part himself. This is quite possibly the best Marvel to date.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","DeBBss","13 March 2022","Spider-Man: No Way Home had the potential to be great, but everything didn't really mesh together as it should've. Tobey and Maguire's Spider-Mans didn't really feel like the same versions from all those years ago, or at least that's what I feel. And the villains were all meh except for Doc Oc and Green Goblin, but even these villains weren't as great as they were before. Everything feels watered down in my opinion, and the stakes were just not high enough for me to take enough interest.There are some nice nostalgia scenes and good action pieces, but that's pretty much it. The acting feels cheesy most of the time and there's way too much crying, some people may not mind the amount of crying, but they are really trying to exaggerate the emotions.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a decent movie, 5/10 - 6/10; nowhere near an 8.5. It had the concept but not the execution. It all seems more like nostalgia-bait more than anything. It is worth a watch at the end of the day, so I'd give it a recommendation to all the Spider-Man fans.","

Just from the initial phase of Tom distracting Dr Strange during one of his spells, 5x, ugh. It's annoying. The action is sub par and the dialogue is fit for teenagers.Then stretch it out to 2.5 hours as Dafoe has to get his acting scenes in and be the lead villian.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kuner-59029","16 December 2021","After the animated Spider-Man - Into the Spider-Verse, it was an incredibly smart business move by Sony to attempt something similar with their new Spider-Man movie. And considering the mammoth task of juggling so many characters, the overall storyline isn't bad. This could have easily been a far less focused movie tripping all over itself. However, No Way Home trips over something, that isn't its own fault:
The Tom Holland Spider-Man films and universe are just not very interesting. Tom Holland is an okay actor, but his tenure has suffered by having been shoehorned into the other Marvel films, never having had an origin story or even much in terms of character development or motivation.Does anyone remember how his story even began? Everyone remembers Tobey Maguire's Spidey origin. You kind of remember Andrew Garfield's, even if it was almost the exact same story, just less interesting.Tom Holland is a bit of blank state. He does his wide eyed stare and overexcited fast talking thing, but is given very little to work with. Most of the Marvel movies had him on as comic relief, playing second or third fiddle to their mainstay characters.His own movies likewise got bogged down in ""bathos"" humor, constantly winking at the audience and having characters break character for Family Guy style self-referential humor or ""what is happening?"" moments. They were largely plot driven films instead of character driven like the Sam Raimi films.Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield command the screen whenever they appear in this movie. They slip back into their roles like it was yesterday, and it truly makes me hope that Sony will be brave enough to continue their stories in their respective iterations and universes. Andrew Garfield's films suffered from poor script writing, lame villains and a botched attempt at starting a cinematic universe, but he is extremely charismatic and fun to watch. He almost steals the show here.Willem Dafoe and especially Alfred Molina are fantastic here as well, while Electro and Lizard are unnecessary in an already overpopulated roster. I'm glad they didn't throw Venom in as well (surely they were tempted to).One of the major problems here is that the villains have no relationship to Holland's protagonist, and they have little to no motivation to fight someone they never met. The script demands it though, since these Marvel movies need an action scene ever 20 minutes.The parts where characters are talking are actually a lot more interesting than the fighting scenes, which just grind the narrative to a halt to throw a bunch of noisy CGI crap at the screen. This is especially frustrating at the end, where a giant brawl breaks out for no reason whatsoever right in the middle of the heroes and villains actually negotiating.Zendaya and the comic relief kid are charisma vacuums, with Zendaya failing to act as any kind of emotional anchor to the plot, and the other guy failing to be funny. When they share the screen with the characters from the previous series, it becomes painfully obvious how outclassed they are. Maguire and Dunst shared real on screen chemistry, as did Garfield and Stone.In the end, the best this film has to offer is nostalgia and *hopefully* a path to resurrect the previous Spider-Man film series as Sony does their own thing, separate from the MCU. The MCU is pretty much grasping at straws at this point and burned out much of its audience with six subpar films (Eternals, Shang Chi, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Far from Home and even Endgame, which was a major step down from Infinity War) and who knows how much terrible filler stuff on TV.Sony would do well to pick up where they left off. A 4th Raimi Spiderman with Maguire would be a box office hit.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","dhruvrajraulji","5 April 2022","Ohh man, what a ride. This movie is a dream come true for me. So Spider-man: No Way Home, before I write this let me collect my thoughts. I would say my review might be a lot partial, I have watched this movie 5 times in theatres in every format available. The movie is everything everyone wanted. Jon Watts 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 you really outdid yourself from the prequels. Let's start with the main crew. Tom Holland, I haven't been a big fan of his spider-man since his take felt a bit childish in the previous movies, but I gotta change my opinion now since, man he felt like a real Peter Parker this time. The Peter Parker known to make sacrifices for the greater good, he was perfect, from the initial childish role to maturing by the end of the movie, it felt unreal. Zendaya, she is just perfect, the best MJ - Michelle Jones that is, but his and Tom's chemistry is perfect, they are made for each other and so are their characters. Ned played a perfect supporting role. And the villains, nobody is better than Willem Dafoe. I guess they all redeemed themselves in a way. Especially Electro, ""I thought you were black"". Oh yeah, Dr. Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch, his and Peter's were nothing but amusing.Now moving on to the story. The daredevil cameo was quick in a rather fully loaded movie. The villains came and started wreaking havoc. Peter ""Tom"" got the line that he deserved when Aunt May dies by the hand of the Goblin. That rage that he felt I could relate to the character so much. The way his friends tried to help him, especially MJ. And then the entry of the two Peter's. Andrew was perfect. I loved him, cause I am from the generation who saw him as the Spider-man. He was amazing, just awesome. Whereas Tobey, his presence felt unreal. I never thought I would be so happy seeing him. And the conclusion and the way the Peters worked together that was the best one of the best action sequences ever. The way they made memes real and yes they talked about the webs, you know how it is produced inside Tobeys Peter. I loved how the conclusion came about where Tobey taught Tom's Peter to not cross the line and stay true to his hero name. And finally when Strange reversed the spell, where Peter made the decision of making everyone forget about him, to save his loved ones. The scene in the bakery where Peter decides not to tell MJ who he is and the new suit. The movie is perfect.IF NOT WATCHED YET, WATCH IT, PLEASE WATCH IT.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","shawthingproductions","16 December 2021","I am not the target audience. I don't mind Marvel films, I don't even mind comics, but I don't obsess over them in the way some people do (and it is fine that they get enjoyment from these films). This review is for people like myself, if you're a fan of Marvel and Spiderman then - simply put - you will love the film.For me, I found I was bored. The running time is long, the story is a little ""meh"" (Spiderman wants to SAVE the villains) and everything is just a little too convenient with plot points coming that are obvious from the get go. In short: It's a cookie-cut film. Marvel has their formula (and clearly it works for them) and they won't stray from that. Sorry, but I am in Ridley Scott's camp. There's no originality anymore.By now you probably already know that other faces do pop up in the film. There are some fun scenes with these characters and I chuckled a couple of times but - the rest of the audience was whooping, cheering and clapping which actually bugged me more as - it meant I missed a lot of dialogue after a character's reveal. Seriously, if you want to chat loudly - stay at home and watch the film instead of forcing others to listen to your inane thoughts.Tom Holland is good as Spiderman and, in this film, he shows a lot of range with his emotion - which was great to see because, until this film, we hadn't really seen that from him but, really, he is the only positive I can think of when it comes to this film. By tomorrow, I would have forgotten most of what I'd just watched.It's average at best. If you're a fan boy, it's the best Marvel film yet. Only you know which camp you belong in (and again, either camp is fine).","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","quiqueperezsoler","2 June 2022","The MCU Spider-Man has finally arrived. I had to take some time for this experience to sink in and assimilate what it alone has accomplished in a 2h runtime. Well done, Marvel, well done.For those who criticised this movie of having a ""pandering"" fan service or messy plot didn't quite understand the main purpose and theme of the movie. I am not excusing its possible filmmaking-related flaws, but it never set out to be flawless in the first place and I love that about it.This movie wasn't only about pleasing fans but it was also about providing Tom Holland's Spider-Man of the wake up call it so desperately needed. Everyone who criticised the MCU portrayal of Spider-Man has been proven wrong as the character has evolved and matured over the course of the movies to reach the portrayal we all know and love. Far From Home was a step in the right direction from Homecoming, but this one is the pinnacle of it all. I have to give it to screen writters and everyone creatively involved in the movie from a story perspective because they have outdone themselves. This movie, while not exempt of filmmaking flaws and contrivances, has delivered what we never thought we needed. Maybe it's me, maybe I'm blinded by the fact that any and all plot devices used in this movie are of my liking. In a world of magic and sci-fi, political disputes and spionage are rendered a bit underwhelming to me.About the fan service, this is fan service done right, because it services the story. The multiversal backdrop serves primarily for two things: redemption and realisation. I don't want to get into too much spoilers, but certain characters and emotional moments return to redeem characters who need redemption and for others to realise that actions have consequences. Something that we finally see in an MCU Spider-Man movie, something that ever since its comicbook conception in the 1970s has defined and established the character as one of the best in the industry.Like Dave Filoni said about Star Wars: ""It's not really about what we decorate it with (x-wings, lightsabers, aliens) but the familial conflicts, the emotional turmoil that defines Star Wars and sets it apart from the rest"". Spider-man is not what we decorate it with, is not only about the swinging, the villains, the crazy adventures, it's about the human element, it's about how these affect the Man in Spider-Man. I have always been more fascinated with the portions of the comic where we see internal struggle within Peter, when we see him fail, loose, suffer; because it makes the eventual triumph that much more spectacular.This movie single-handedly fixes whatever I saw was wrong with Tom Holland's Spiderman portrayal and elevated him to the stratosphere, leaving him off with a great prospect on what is to come. Not only that, but every character introduced is given enough moments to shine and takeaway something from this major event. Every single character that I wasn't quite sold on (from the principal ones I mean) have found a place to shine and show performances that enhances the movie, particularly Zendaya, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina.It's one of the most daring MCU plots yet and it also manages to please all the cinematic Spider-Man fans at the same time. Whatever movie flaw it might have I have overlooked them as I do the rest of the MCU movies. These are not meant to revolutionise cinema, they are here to entertain, to provide interesting characters and stories and, sometimes even, to elevate and uplift us.IN CONCLUSION, I have no issues with this movie overall. I have some small nitpicks here and there, mostly to do with some of the comedy and side characters. But other than that, it sets out to do what it intended and, believe or not, serves as both conclusion to the MCU Spider-man and also transitioning movie to the stories to come. And I for one can not wait to see what's in store. If you are a Spider-Man fan you will love this movie because it does everything right, if you are a casual MCU fan you will be entertained and amused; and if you are a casual movie fan this movie might be a bit confusing. But then again, these are comicbook stories, I don't know what to tell you.","

It will enhance the experience.And not only that, the movie has its own story and identity. What Tom Holland's Spiderman goes through - it was very satisfying to watch.The ending is the best ending in the MCU trilogy, and probably one of my favorite spiderman endings.The movie took some risks and things will never be the same for spiderman after this movie - and I am excited to see what will come next.There are some moments where the scene / conversation goes too long that it gets kinda frustrating / annoying. The action is nice but not as good as stuff like shang-chi.These are just small nit-picks, the overall experience is still great.*There are Two End-credit scenes, and Both are fantastic.**Willem Dafoe more like Willem DaGoat.","

The screenplay is not all bad because it managed to bring all the villains and spider-men from the previous versions and comprise them in one movie but the plot is poor and childish.Marisa Tomei as Peter Parker's aunt is laughable, her acting and dialogues are naive, she seems misplaced in the movie.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","malcolmjohnston","16 December 2021","After leaving the cinema it dawned on me what I'd just watched a film that should have been lost through inter studio politics and there greedy hands but what we have is quite possible the zenith of all superheroes movies. I honestly didn't think Avengers:Endgame would ever be equaled as a grand MCU movie but this just puts everything before it in the shade, maybe it's because Spiderman is such a beloved superheroe? Maybe it's the imperious special effects? Maybe it's the supporting cast? Who knows but this is the Spider-Man movie you always wanted
Only thing left to ponder is will Sony and Marvel/Disney see the potential of working together to give the money paying public more of this kind of collaboration or will the dollar signs get in the way.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","isaacsundaralingam","17 December 2021","(No Spoilers)Spiderman: No Way Home is probably the biggest superhero movie since Avengers Endgame... There's no denying that. Ever since this movie's announcement, you knew this was a bigger deal than the usual superhero flicks. And being a movie with such high expectations, means that there's so much room for things to go wrong. And unfortunately... It seems like it did.Now I'm fresh out of the theatre, and I already feel like this movie had so much potential wasted. A sentiment I also share towards Avengers Endgame; where the only thing the writers seemed to worry about was 'fan-service'. Fan service is fine honestly, but the line should be when fan-service slowly starts taking over for storytelling. Because the storytelling in this movie was childish.Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie... I enjoyed the theatre experience... It was fun... But fun is not enough when you realize what could have been. Spiderman: No Way Home could have been Marvel's most ambitious project yet, but it has the curse of Marvel's horrible writing staff who similarly messed up everything from Avengers Endgame, to WandaVision, to Falcon and the Winter Soldier, to Loki and to Black Widow. The plot of the movie sounds like some cheap fan fiction that somehow got made. And what's even worse is its absolutely cringe worthy dialogue; existing for the sole purpose of reminding the audience of previous Spiderman movies. It's such a dumb and convenient plot that just exists for the sake of nostalgia.I loved Avengers Infinity War and I really enjoyed Spiderman Far From Home, but I haven't enjoyed a single Marvel project since, because all their projects have been so shallow with no real substance to back itself up. Marvel has a writing problem that needs to be looked into, for the sake of cinema and storytelling.What a missed opportunity... What an absolutely missed opportunity...","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","lucaslw-93145","19 December 2021","This is it. It's what we've all been waiting for. This is the Infinity War equivalent for the Spider-Man movies, it's the most ambitious cross-over in the history of Spider-Man, and honestly, the most ambitious cross-over since Infinity War.Insane cast, Willem Dafoe brings an Oscar-worthy performance, Tom Holland and Marisa Tomei both bring their dramatic A-game, Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprising their roles with heartfelt intensity, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are incredible antagonists (though as far as villains go, Dafoe steals the show, just as Garfield does for the good guys).Insane fan service. Great intro of Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock in official MCU capacity. Fantastic way to bring back Garfield and Maguire. Great choice of villains, even if the 6th member of the Sinister Six was getting drunk in Mexico. We finally get an official ""With great power, comes great responsibility"". Nice meme material, ""You know, I'm something of a scientist myself"" and ""my back"". The fan service here didn't feel forced.Great action. CGI wasn't the best the MCU has to offer, but absolutely gets the job done. I think as the Dr. Strange's skills as a sorcerer have improved, so too have the creativity of the visuals used to depict his spells. Very fresh feel of the mirror dimension this time around, looking forward to seeing it again in the next Dr. Strange film.Most of all, it's a great story. The character growth is dynamic and well paced. It happens on all facets and it's very clear that the writers and Jon Watts have taken to heart criticism of the first two MCU Spider-Man films. There's the heart-wrenching loss of Aunt May (never gets easier to see any Spider-Man losing someone), a serious stepping up of Tom Holland's Peter Parker to be more than just an Iron Man Jr., and an apologetic reminder that Parker is broke (and not a Stark trust fund kid), both during the movie and once again at the end, when his slate is wiped clean. Garfield gets a chance to save Holland's MJ in a very dramatic mini-""redemption arc"". The best part of the script is the motif that Spider-Man's best attribute is his incredible moral compass, and great moral strength, willing to take on all the pain and sacrifice so that his friends and neighborhood can live on prosperously even if he gets left behind. It's an echo that establishes the Spider-Man at the end of the film as a spiritual successor to Capt. America more strongly than it does as an Iron Man Jr. The growth that Maguire and Garfield's Spider-Men bring in helping Holland's Spider-Man realize that vengeance is not what Aunt May would have wanted, and by extension, is not the Spider-Man way is incredibly touching and a fantastic dynamic for the three Spider-Men. Toby Maguire's goodbye in the movie ""You know. It's what we do"" to Tom Holland is a great send-off and acknowledgement that the mantle of Spider-Man is never an easy one to wear, but it's one that Spider-Men in every universe wear with great power and responsibility.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a tale of sacrifice, growth, and redemption. Say what you will about the quantity of the MCU, but the quality of select films like Spider-Man: No Way Home is undeniable, and I hope this isn't the last time we see an adventure as epic as this was.","

Other than that, everything is poor and really disappointing even for Marvel standards. It has very poor story telling terrible directing and poor story. To much moral cliches are included which will really bore you.All in all, apart from the computer work, it's a below average teenage film. I was amazed by high rankings and was expecting something like infinity war, at least something like avengers but got very disappointed after watching this childish movie.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","papanloveu","17 December 2021","Honestly fully confident this is best spider-man movie. Found myself subconsciously clapping and just screaming inside with joy. The returns of some characters are incredible. The film balances the comedy with a dark/sad plot to follow. Tom Hollands spider-man in a film so crowded still manages to shine and outdoes himself with his performance. This feels like a true spider-man movie especially in the very last scene. His performance is incredible and some of the action sequences are beautiful with moves taken from the game. This feels like the most badass, realistic and cool portrayal of a spider-man yet. It maintains comic accuracy and tom's suits are beautiful. Some scenes are absolutely heart wrenching, i found myself crying numerous times. This film is a masterpiece and a love letter to all marvel or spiderman fans and a work of art. It avoids the other spider-man movies mistakes and just gives characters such realistic convincing arcs. A true work of art, round of applause for John Watts and Tom Holland.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Horst_In_Translation","20 August 2022","""Spider Man: No Way Home"" (not the best title) is, as you knew already from the title, one of the most recent Marvel movies out there. With the Avengers films over after the Thanos battle, pretty much every character is about to find closure in a way. Oh well, what you saw at the end of the most recent Thor film does not indicate that, but the final sequence with Tom Hardy here is not as much of an introduction to a fourth Spider-Man film, so it will maybe stay at three. The music you heard with the closing credits was also fairly fitting from this perspective. Of course, it is also a great connection to the three Spideys from this film here, but I will get to that a little later. Let's look at the basics first: The director is Jon Watts and he was also in charge of the previous two Spider-Man movies. Same is true for the two writers. It is not a surprise that they got chosen too for this one, but the real surprise was maybe that they got picked for the first film five years ago maybe as they were not really famous. Then again, these Marvel films rarely go for the truly defining filmmakers of our generation, but get in some new blood instead most of the time. Just like this trilogy here. The director worked on several Fatboy Slim music videos in the past and the two writers McKenna and Sommers collaborated on American Dad, which is both pretty cool. As for the cast, you will find a handful names from the previous films, obviously Tom Holland in the lead and also Zendaya who is really cruising right now with her roles here and in Dune. Jacob Batalon looks much more manly in real than in this film where he plays a nerdy character. Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange is really in every Marvel movie these days, which shows how popular he is. Benedict Wong I definitely appreciate here too as always. I like his character a lot, but sadly he does not have a lot of screen time here. Marisa Tomei is also back and she plays the youngest Aunt May you will probably ever come across. Still interesting that she is the only Oscar winner from the original cast here. They brought in another one with an Academy Award, but more about him in a second.The certainly most memorable aspect about this film here is how they used the multiverse idea to include the Spider-Man characters of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire despite how long ago it was for them to portray the character. Well, mostly for Maguire, but it was so cool to see them reprise their roles and the entire idea that they are still Spider-Man and always will be. No matter how much time passes. Of course, I am a little biased here because I adored the Sam Raimi movies back then, at least the first two, and I also quite like Andrew Garfield as an actor. I guess I will always rate these two above Tom Holland who I have disliked for a while, but he has grown a bit on me here admittedly and I will wait with my final judgement until I have checked out his previous two Spider-Man outings. As for the other two, they did not come alone, which adds even more awesomeness. We also get the key antagonists from their movies again. This includes Jamie Foxx, the other Oscar winner I mentioned early on and Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church, even if the latter two did not get featured too much. But Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn were and this was utterly amazing because I love the two characters and also so enjoyed their performances back then and now again in this film. What a blast this was and this is a key reason why I give this film a really enthusiastic recommendation and not just a solid one. I think Doc Ock was the one who we saw first in here in terms of the antagonists they brought back. They all had really cool introductions. Also interesting references about how they do not know about their own deaths, but talk about others' before they realize the gruesome truth. When they were there locked in these chambers, they almost felt like dogs. Dogs that once bit somebody, did something awful, but the protagonist tries to bring them and their hurt souls back and have them live lives as normal human beings without evil taking over.Dr. Strange is not happy about this idea at all and he even follows and fights Spidey over it. He sure could not be kept inside this chamber for long, but spider webs were more effective on one occasion. This role has turned Cumberbatch into an actor who is easier to like for me now after really struggling with him on Sherlock and also on The Power of the Dog very recently, a film that did not impress me one bit. But back to this one here: Strange is of course also the connection to the multiverse once again and with the latter I also keep struggling a bit at times, but here it was alright overall I guess. I remember his comment that they know almost nothing about the multiverse, haven't explored the way it works at all. I second that. Comedy is of course also something you always find in Marvel films and this one here is no exception. Unfortunately, they cannot get in the Stan Lee cameos anymore, but those were never really funny anyway, more like cult. Funny moments here include Strange's reaction when he finds out that Spidey has not even tried to talk to the people from MIT after he and his buddies got rejected. But yeah, I guess saving this woman's life there helped with that then. For me personally, it was very funny when the three Spider-Mans compared their ""web activities"" and certain techniques that the characters had in their films that differed from each other. Like how Maguire's had basically an endless stack of webs and Garfield's character had to literally create his in a lab or something which was exhausting. I guess this was where the superhero aspect already moved a bit aside for science as Garfield's was then a bit more of a Batman approach.What else felt funny? Oh yes, how they encourage each other, especially Garfield's character when they call each other amazing. Like ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". Another charming reference there back to the books and the original title. I could really go on and on here with the moments that will make you smile or maybe even laugh, but I will leave it at that. In any case, the film was also a triumph from this perspective. And I would not say this is a given because I have been critical at times with comedy in Marvel movies and I am referring there a bit to Tony Stark's Iron Man and his sometimes try-hard punchlines and especially to Chris Pratt who has absolutely no comedic talent if his material is not outstandingly good. By the way, Tony Stark is also included briefly in this film here or rather his company I should say. He himself is not for obvious reasons. A few words on Zendaya: I was critical about her too in the past and I still think the way she is overexposed in Hollywood right now does not match her talent as a whole. If we are talking about Spider-Man's romantic interest, I'd probably pick Emma Stone over her, Kirsten Dunst maybe not. Still Zendaya is growing a bit on me as well. I just wish she would go with her full name at some point. That would make it easier to respect her as an actress. Anyway, there was really only one moment here that she had that I did not like, namely when she stands up against Dr. Strange. That was not a strong female moment, but on the cringeworthy side, also how softly Strange reacted to her. He was right really when he said that Holland's Peter Parker is just a boy and that's it. J. Jonah Jameson would definitely agree and it is just a phenomenon how J. K. Simmons keeps portraying the character for decades. Awesome stuff as I adore the actor, but I must still say it is a such a limited character that there was almost nothing to him here this time. Only seeing him early on in his chamber there recording more anti-Spidey propaganda was funny. He surely made him his priority gently-speaking. Or, more accurately, his obsession. So there is a third Oscar winner on board here in fact.As my review is getting closer to an end, I also want to talk a little more about the other Spideys here. They included really great references to their films from years ago that kinda made me want to watch those again at some point in the near future. I mean pretty much their entire inclusion here did. But there were specific moments too and those were not about the comedy like some of the earlier stuff I mentioned, but they were about serious situations. I am referring to Franco's character in these very old films or also how Osborn says he has a job for Parker, just like he liked the character back then and with Garfield's character the most serious moment is of course when he holds Zendaya's character like he held Stone's back then. But Holland's character, the current Spidey, also has his own major loss here. Family affair. The moment was maybe not as touching as I would have liked it to be, so yeah there are negative criticisms for me too with this film for sure, but they are not too major. The good moments are far more frequent. The ending in terms of closure was really nice too with how he runs into certain characters again and we know there is hope for him and with Zendaya's character it is also best if he starts anew and destroys the note he prepared. It's basically as if his universe is a new one as well. Only he remembers what happened. Back to solitude and ready to save the world or at least New York many more times. Look at the cup on the table and what is written on it before he swings out in the end through New York during wintertime. The snow was amazing. At the very end, let me say that you also see Jake Gyllenhaal at the very start in what is a reference back to the second movie from this trilogy. But as I said, the closure to this third film and the entire trilogy could not have been any better. Great job and this makes it very easy to forget some previous mediocrities. Such a creative movie. One of 2021's best. Do not miss out.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Adam-09265","9 June 2022","Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this movie. Although it mainly just looked like a cameo showcase with some connective plot. Even the lines were cameo'd in certain areas to possibly trigger nostalgia more.I sort of liked the story and get what they were trying to do, but it seemed too complicated to be executed with a clean narrative. I don't like how Doctor Strange was down powered by Peter Parker, i know Peter is a smart nerdy kid with powers but it destroyed the whole mystic arts master vibe that we love from Strange. Maybe it's just me that felt that way.Like i said i get the idea but it was too quick of an execution. I guess development would cause the movie to be 5 hours long. It was a little cringy in areas where i noticed plot holes just so they could speed up the story and not give proper explanations. It was just too large of an idea to crush into a 2+ hour movie and make sense.My answer is enjoy the movie through nostalgia and entertainment, don't look for clean story because instead the movie looked like a brag on what Disney can accomplish when making deals with other studios. Using nostalgia as a weapon again, Disney do this all the time.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","fanchnou","4 February 2022","Spiderman Far From Home is to years of stand alone Spider-Man movies what Avenger Endgame was to Avengers: an amazing grand finale to wrap up all the previous adventures in a grand manner, thus allowing a new phase.This allows something very special:
Tobey, Andrew & Tom are no longer three different set of movies, they all come to as one adventure, together.Spidey is now reset to a new beginning (no caretaker, no girlfriend, no best friend). This will allow the building of a whole new story.Because Spidey Tom still remembers it all, this closed chapter can't be dismissed or forgotten, it is the building block of what's to come. It's a bittersweet legacy which opens door to bringing back the past if writers want to go that way at a later stage (after all, a spell can be reversed, most times!).I always loved these three actors, seeing them together was a dream come true I could never have dreamt of in the past. And before you know it, it's already the end of the movie, this is how captivating it is. 10/10 for me for sure!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","aldri-feb","15 December 2021","No Way Home is undeniably the most emotional and the most entertaining of Tom Holland's Spider-Man. It's a full Spidey Fan Service for sure. While in Homecoming and Far From Home, Peter Parker's character felt quite childish, this film would show the transititon of a more grown-up Peter Parker, and Tom Holland did really well for making it happen. Of course No Way Home has many surprises that I won't spoil, but don't expect too much on storyline. The plot is pretty simple actually, and the trailer had already shown almost all the plot. So don't be spoiled if you wanted to have fun watching Spider-Man No Way Home, because the surprise elements are the key of this film.","

The movie got all those star to come back and play in it. And since the first Spiderman movie was around the year 2000, 2 decades of fan came back to flood the scoring with a bunch of 10s. The plot I must say is quite infuriating, they have taken this no killing thing way too far and have decided to make the Tom holland peter a very annoying kid. Perhaps it is because it is the first major film in phase 4, but if they want to create an event to introduce the antagonist in phase 4 at least let it be something cool and not some stupid teenager's stupid mistake.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tm-sheehan","16 December 2021","My Review - Spider-Man : No Way Home
My Rating 8/ 10I've never seen a queue like this one at our local regional Blue Mountains Cinema so it looks like this new Spider-Man movie will be a Box Office bonanza . It certainly needs to be as the estimated Production Budget was an obscene $200 million USDollars .I rated the previous Spider-Man: Far From Home a very respectable 8/10 as I enjoyed it immensely.This movie is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and is the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) takes place directly after the events of Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019). Meaning that it takes place in the Spring/Fall of 2024.With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help. When a spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear, forcing Peter to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.The ingredient I enjoy most in this Marvel franchise and there's a lot of comic book humour in Spider-Man or as I think this one should really be titled Spider-Men. No spoilers but I enjoyed the second half of this long movie more than the first especially when Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire form the formidable trio of Arachnids.It's amazing to me where original quotes from Spider-Man show up and are used by other cultural iconic personalities I didn't realise that Ru Paul's often used quote ""With great power comes great responsibility, which Queen 👑 have you chosen to get the CHOPPED? Is a proverb popularized by the Spider-Man comic books written by Stan Lee and published by Marvel Comics
Of course the CGI effects are the best State of the Art but I think it's the great ensemble cast that makes these films so entertaining including the Actor of the moment Benedict Cumberbatch as the Wizard Dr Stange . I particularly enjoyed Zendayer as Peter Parker's girlfriend she has some great moments with Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and she's delightfully natural.Tom Holland helped to save this movie from cancellation by forcing renegotiations between Sony and Disney. Under the terms of the new deal, not only does Spider-Man: No Way Home still take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but Spider-man can also appear in future MCU movies, as well as Sony's own Spider-Man franchise.If Sci Fi Action is your favourite movie genre you'll probably rate this latest Marvel movie higher than my quite high 8/10 Rating but I thought it a bit dull in parts and a tad too long 20minutes longer than Spider-Man : Far from Home which I enjoyed more and that movie only cost a mere $140 million estimated budget to make.Great Escapism Movie - Well done.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","The_Dog_Father","23 July 2022","I couldn't find one thing to like about it.Such a climatic ending and cliff hanger for Spider-Man Far From Home, and this starts out flat as an opened, left in the car for a week, diet no caffeine coke.I was in shock how pathetically written the movie started out, doing an ""okay, all is forgotten, you kids can get on with your life now."" Sloppy, lazy, and insulting, even to the youngest of fans out there.Like a date promised to go to a nice restaurant, and they end up getting treated to that one hot dog at the gas station that has been on the back rotisserie for a day and half.As we get over the first absurd shock, the movie just keeps getting worse and worse, more ridiculous as the plot unfolds. Recycled parts, with a really bad appearance with Dr. Strange in it. Their tango together and how that was written is even more absurd than the story line itself. This obsession to defy rules without maturity, by this 3rd Spider-Man, was just too annoying to even come close to liking it. It must be part of the mental issues with kids out there now, ""I can fix it, and save the bad guys.""So very anti-climatic from leaving off from ""Far From Home."" Stale, horrible plot, worst script, and so very dull. I wonder if Samuel L.

However, I excepted a bit more in this as the ratings seems really high. But, all my expectations fall flat. I donno why they tried to present Spider-man as a messy one! Most stupidest thing is why would he tries to snach the box from doctor strange? For saving these dangerous criminals??","

This film was fun and surprising and I'm glad to see this in opening night. The only flaw I had is that I wish we had a little more storytelling to it but the Aunt May Death was very emotional and it did feel a little rush to me.

Andrew who's just amazing. And Tom who's Tony Stark's trainee. I loved every detail in it, I liked how Toby is still decent, polite, He's just our spider man who raised us to do what's right no matter what's the cost. And you always have a 2nd chance to be good. On other hand, Tom taught us that with great powers comes great responsibility, and we should never seek revenge and do the right thing. I love all of them and I hope to see TASM3 soon as Andrew really deserves it. And when I say the best I've ever seen, It's really the best I've ever seen. Hopefully Dr. MOM top this movie.","

""He did the thing"", ""It's the guy"", ""Wow they did the joke"". It's just so bland and Disney is just mainstreaming everything to be some bland cash in on nostalgia. Every now and then you can see an interesting concept or a good scene shine through but more often than not, it is ruined right away by some stupid joke or switch to a funny scene. There is no character no soul left in these corporate franchises.Content like this doesn't matter, it is just like another Fifa or Madden game every year. They dont care about actually creating something worthwhile.What doesn my opinion matter anyways. For every one of my opinion there are houndreds of thousands of people who have no expectations.","

For example, I honestly found the previous Spiderman movie to be mostly pretty boring. But this one...this is amazing! The way both of the previous Spidermen, as well as pretty much all the major villains, from the old movies, all feature in this (they don't just make cameos, they are actively part of the story!), and are ALL played by the original actors, is just so incredibly awesome! They even throw in Daredevil and Venom cameos! Then add on the fact that they actually try to SAVE all the villains rather than kill them...It's just fantastic...If you're a Spiderman fan, or a superhero fan, this is a mut-watch, and if you're not, you should see it anyway!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","impendingdd","4 June 2022","Villains were standing around most of the movie. Tobey was hugely wasted. Makes no sense whatsoever how he doesn't even acknowledge that the man he watched Die (Norman Osbourne) and btw his dead best friend's dad, is living before him in the flesh. No shock, no emotion. Even just for a small moment. Didn't need to take away Tom's shine at all. The director or Marvel says, hey let's give him a moment with Doc Ock! It's just really mind boggling how they go out of their way to be mediocre. This movie is just as bad as the other films of the trilogy. It's boring. It's depressing. Peter in this movie is very annoying and unbelievably naive, even for what most people will say is excusable because he's ""just a kid."" No one cared enough for this Aunt May to die as much as we would have cared for the Aunt May from Tobeys universe because we felt their connection. Lets be honest the relationship with Happy was weird. Happy crossed a major boundary slamming Peter's aunt. Totally uncomfortable. If anyone thinks I should be grateful because at least we see all three generations of Spidey on screen, I don't understand the logic. If I get free ice cream and it tastes like dog turd I'm not gonna be thrilled and say ""hey at least it's free ice cream!"" Im allowed to say what I dislike. Stop settling for mediocrity when better films have been made.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tarynabryant","17 December 2021","As a huge Doctor Strange fan who is more than ready for more of the multiverse, I had very high expectations for No Way Home. Unfortunately, it was a let down. Sure it caters to fans with some nostalgic moments, but relies way way way too much on the fan service while lacking in pretty much all other areas. The story was all over the place, pacing was very wishy-washy, and the writing was horrendous for the most part. It felt very childish and cheap at a lot of moments with jokes that just did not land at all and some super corny dialogue. My best friend and I were genuinely confused at the amount of laughs, cheers, and claps from our audience in the theater tonight (and we are both very big Marvel fans, my best friend being a long-time, devoted spidey fan). So believe me when I tell you that we really wanted to love this movie. Honestly our favorite part of the entire film was the post-credits features. If anything, this movie only further solidified my belief that Tom Holland is the weakest of the Spider-Mans. Not necessarily his fault, but rather the fault of the writers for trying way too hard to make him a quirky, shy, stuttery, awkward teenager and not giving him any real development or depth to his character aside from maybe the two seconds after May's death and his fight with Osborn where we see a glimpse of a dark side in him, but that's it. Additionally, killing off May was just so lame. It reeked of ""we need to kill off a character for some kind of shock value but not anyone too important"". Another moment that I don't understand is when Toby is seemingly fatally injured in a sudden and surprising moment towards the end of the film, but then is all of a sudden okay a few minutes later? There were just too many moments that felt like it was relying on audience reactions and surprise in order to come across as a good movie. I think the main reason it is receiving such praise right now is because of the current hype around Andrew and Toby reprising their roles (which was great fun don't get me wrong), but in the long run didn't feel like it served much of a purpose to the actual story beyond wanting to drop a bombshell on fans. By the fifth conversation/conflict about how Peter can ""cure"" the villains and save the world, the entire movie became a jumbled and chaotic mess. Interesting concept but executed poorly.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mattflohr","21 February 2022","Tom Holland's third featuring entry as the titular web-slinger is a masterpiece. The character development is poignant and heartfelt. The love for the source material is in every frame. All of the actors are brilliant and nobody phones in anything. This could so easily have felt like nostalgia bait but it's so much more than that. Willem Dafoe's performance alone is worth the price of admission. He is unbelievably good in this movie. Andrew Garfield is perfect. Tobey Maguire is perfect. Tom Holland has always been great and this is his best performance. Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are perfect. Cimenatography stunning. Script is once in a lifetime. They do so much in this movie and they pull off all of it. Comedy beats are wonderful and often ingenious. Drama is heartwrenching and believable. Instantly relatable. We don't deserve a movie this good. This movie didn't have to be this good. But it is and I love it.Does it have any faults? The story doesn't make a lick of sense, but that's okay.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jaysanchu07","14 March 2022","A certified crowd pleaser, No Way Home had me grinning from ear to ear with my finger pointed at the screen far too often. It is definitely my favorite of the Tom Holland films, and a shade under Spiderman 2 as the best one yet. To see Alfred Molina, William Dafoe and Jamie Foxx reprising their roles, was INSANE. Each of their entrances caused goosebumps and their acting, pure nostalgia! Props to Dafoe! His voice and facial expressions remains perfect for the Goblin 20 years later. Really, the reality where we see these characters together is unthinkable, yet here we have it, and the film ensures its more than fan service! Spiderman, choosing to 'cure' gives these characters a shot at the main theme of the film, redemption. This brings us to the grandest (& most spoiled) reveal in recent years, the appearance of the other Spidermen! It is difficult to comprehend and put into words the feeling of seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield suit up. Filmmakers even graces its fans by showing PLENTY of these Parkers as they play huge roles in the third act, complimenting the emotional themes of the film. In fact, my favorite redemption story arch was that of Andrew's. I was blown away by how invested he was. When he caught Zendaya's MJ, his outpour of raw emotions sent shivers down my spine. It was gratifying to see the filmmakers give him justice. Another positive is we finally have a mature version of Tom Holland's Spidey. We see his mistakes and struggles to confront its consequences, themes of a grounded and relatable superhero we love and admire.All positives mentioned, the film does have shortcomings in its plot. There were moments I feel unnecessary like Aunt May's demise, Sandman's motivation and everything Ned. The premise that 'too many requests' during the spell casting ushered the multiverse crisis had a weak hold on me, and to blame it on Spiderman was a head scratcher. The film does however, a tremendous job of giving us things to love to overcome these holes. The sheer volume of iconic characters is a remarkable feat no one thought possible.Spiderman: No Way Home is then, a well packaged present as it delivers what both hardcore and casual fans want and desire. And for that, I give a score of 8.5/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","mr_sharma","15 December 2021","As I've said in some of my past reviews, some people only know two ratings, either a 1 or a 10.When every review, I see, is putting out a 10/10, perhaps one should step back and get some perspective. This isn't The Godfather!If you've enjoyed Holland's other outings, you will enjoy this.The trailer gives you clues as to what to expect AND I would strongly suggest you watch all previous Spider-Man films (the Sam Raimi versions and the ""amazing Spider-Man"" versions).It'll help.First of, the film is certainly fun and funny. Lot's of jokes and in jokes.There is some lag though. There is whole 10 minute scene in Happy's apartment that plods a little but then we're back to it.I think of all the previous Spider-Man relationships, Hollands and Zendya's is the most believable (well that may well be as they are a couple in real life).The film is sort of like a sweet nostalgia trip.There are a few questions, we as the audience needed answering and which are even asked in the film, but the answers are never given. Despite that, it does a very good job of resolving a lot and putting to bed a number of issues from past films.I have said nothing of the plot nor do I intend to.The reason you are reading this review is either you want to understand why I didn't give it a 10/10 and therefore why am I not fanboying over it or you genuinely want to know whether it's worth seeing in the cinema.The answer to the first question is that it's a very good film but it won't make my top 10 of all time. There is a lot thrown at this and a lot of it sticks but some of it doesn't quite hit the mark.The answer to the second question is well it depends on the cinema.My advise is that you go see it a big screen, good seating, social distanced cinema. You want that cinematic experience.I went to an multiplex with people sitting next to each other in a reasonably packed theatre with a screen which, frankly by today's standard, was bog standard to small (which surprised me considering the calibre of film being shown),So yeah, go see it (especially if you've seen all the previous ones) but on a grand big old screen cinema with comfortable seating.Enjoy.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","AdrenalinDragon","15 December 2021","One of the best Spider-Man movies ever. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fanservice galore fest done extremely well with jokes, emotion, and heart added to the mix. Not only giving closure to so much of Spider-Man's character, but also for the fans who always wondered how certain things would play out if they happened. This is a movie you need to witness.Picking up right off from Spider-Man: Far from Home, the film gets straight into action with dealing on consequences and trying to amend outcomes. In some ways similar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film stays interesting from scene after scene and never misses a beat. Solid action set pieces and character interactions give the film a lot of fun things to work with, and by the end everyone was clapping and cheering.Without spoilers, No Way Home will please most people who are familiar with all the previous Spider-Man films. I got a little emotional and attached when certain characters popped up again and I definitely didn't feel the movie was a quick-in cashgrab at all. The performances were all really good, the special effects were top notch, and some of the music will be familiar to the fans.In the end, it proves Marvel can still pull off a really entertaining yet rewarding movie for Spider-Man fans. Some minor criticisms I have is there are a few contrivances and maybe some characters could have gotten a bit more screentime, but in the end I had such a blast with what the movie set out to do. No Way Home will probably be my favourite film of 2021. Try to go without spoilers though, it will be more satisfying.8.5/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","siderite","15 March 2022","This film was entertaining enough. I liked the acting, the little gems, the sheer hubris of the story. However, it was for all intents and purposes, a universe consolidation move (before they break it all again in Multiverse of Madness). It's one of those reset stories, but one that manages to unite previous resets, which makes it the resettiest of them all. It is there to basically answer all the comic geek questions about how could so many films and reboots and stories exist in the same MCU and open the door to the future.There were no real new characters, some were explained away, some where killed off and new concepts of the incoming threats hinted at. One end-credits scene winked towards a Venom recrossing, while the second was basically a trailer for the next Doctor Strange film, not a ""scene"".So there is a difference between the typical Marvel cinematic universe film and this one: the villain(s) are weak and unfocused while the plot, however entertaining, just a background to the goal of the film: to stabilize the canon and prepare for the new Doctor Strange movie. This does mean the Strangeverse will grow and possibly be amazingly fun, but also that I don't see the Avengers going anywhere for a long while, except maybe TV series.In conclusion: for the fans of the Marvel stories and the faithful viewers of movies and series in that universe, this is a big nice bonus, a step on a promising ladder of new content. However as a standalone film it has limited value. It is a good film, and probably a necessary one, but its storytelling will not blow your mind in any way.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tareqzaghal","3 September 2023","No Way Home is like a fever dream. It's the type of film that would be made up by fans on YouTube using fake fan trailers or discussions on Reddit. It's a film that truly feels like a pop culture phenomenon, something that cannot be replicated, and an experience people will yearn to have been part of in the cinema in years to come.To critique such a film would be a waste of any viewer's time, you would be missing out on enjoying the entertainment present here, which is amplified a hundred times if you are a fan of all these different incarnations. Corny jokes, flat dialogue and line delivery, some rushed CGI, and lots of instants where things have to happen without making sense in order for the plot to move forward, yes all of that is abundantly present here. If that is to your disliking, that's fair.But it's just a lot of fun, incredibly entertaining and rewatchable, and weirdly comforting. This is undoubtedly Watt's best direction in his trilogy, the entirety of the curing sequence at the flat is beautifully executed, especially the action scenes. The last hour specifically is really tight. It stands out amongst the other Holland films as the one that is best acted, shot, choreographed, structured, and overall most entertaining.Dafoe is devastatingly good as Osborn, a role that might never be done better. Doc Ock is great. Foxx is mostly annoying but provides some good comedic relief. The Lizard is just weird. Sandman is just there. Tobey's return feels rightfully tender. Andrew is still the best one, and the most underrated. Yet, it's impressive that Holland remains at the centre of all the immense nostalgia-bait and fan service, and carries the film on his shoulders, his best performance so far.I hope the next instalment really focuses on a grounded Peter Parker, away from all the Avengers level-threats and multiverse conundrums. Street-level. NYC. Manhattan. College. Daily Bugle. Oscorp. Give me the good stuff pleaaaaase Feige.The MCU can end here, unless they can pull off the Fantastic Four.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","fernandoschiavi","19 June 2022","After months of rumors, theories and speculation, there was a certain fear that expectations around the film had become so high that it would be impossible to meet them. However, this third Spider-Man solo film within the MCU delivers exactly what fans expected and wanted, nothing less and nothing more. The film brilliantly resolves all the criticisms and complaints from most fans; Peter Parker in the MCU was too tight. He wasn't a penniless photographer and student, Aunt May wasn't worried about the bills, there wasn't a J. J. Jameson behind him.Aware of the importance that the Spider-Man has conquered in these almost 20 years, Sony and Marvel Studios have taken the path of nostalgia and made No Return Home a great celebration of this legacy without abandoning the current journey of the Friendly Neighborhood. The biggest proof of this is in the opening minutes of the production, which picks up exactly where Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019) had left off. With the adventurous and almost uncompromising tone characteristic of the two previous films, the story doesn't take long to give the young man a taste of the consequences of being treated as a public enemy by the population. So he turns to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. In the best of intentions, the wizard helps the boy, who ends up disturbing the spell to the point of opening cracks in the much talked about multiverse. This intervention results in the Multiverse being inserted once and for all in the MCU - before, with brushstrokes in Loki, WandaVision and What If...? - And that brings back Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, the Lizard and the Sandman. The reason why the gallery of villains from the different versions of Spider-Man in the movies is gathered is not only commendable, but also a hallmark of Spider-Man and the guiding thread of the entire plot: good for good.Gradually, No Return Home abandons the simplicity that has been Spider-Man's trademark in the MCU and begins to add seriousness in a gradual, but efficient way. More than denying what they did in Homecoming (2017) and Far from Home, screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers promote a more than welcome evolution for the hero and those around him. This also contributes to giving the adventure the epic tone it deserves. This chapter is clearly a coming-of-age plot for today's young Peter Parker from beginning to end. The production delivers numerous factors that lead to the character's growth, providing key moments to make him a leading and somewhat independent hero. While his previous films promise such a question, this is definitely the project that lives up to its evolutionary premise. The film plays in the face of the hero and those who watch that he has to face real and painful consequences, to learn about the responsibilities that come with the mantle he chose to wear to help people and that's exactly what the film addresses: growing up in narrative magnitude and make the character grow in development.Despite the plot seem lost at the beginning, and probably, tiring in very brief moments, and being just an ambitious film that will play with fan service to win over its viewers, everything makes a lot of sense in the journey. This is not a production that wants to please the audience with its huge catalog of characters for nothing. Spider-Man: No Return Home is fun, electrifying and exciting, like a roller coaster full of surprises, and luckily, it delivers great memorable moments. There is a lot to process here, with several characters to assimilate and contain the emotion for what is yet to come, however, there is a very well distributed division to highlight that each figure present is an essential piece to compose this great puzzle that makes clear the extremely well-crafted script by the duo Erik Sommers and Chris McKenna.Knowing the weight of each character involved, whether those who already inhabit this universe, such as Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and the inseparable Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) and MJ (Zendaya), or the villains who return, the text of the duo of screenwriters finds space to deal with each one more than satisfactorily. With so many people involved, the story ran the risk of becoming a mess, but this problem was overcome with a balance rarely seen in Marvel productions.The script strives to give moments to each of these characters and the direction of Jon Watts takes the cue to translate that into memorable moments. Full of reverence for what Sam Raimi and Marc Webb did in the pre-MCU Spider-Man films, the director does his best work in front of the hero by stepping out of his comfort zone and taking advantage of the possibilities created by the presence of so many iconic characters. The action scenes are full of energy and really exciting. With text that quickly ties who the visitors from other universes are to potential viewers who haven't seen Spider-Man's previous adventures on the big screen, No Return Home has a clear path to give them space to shine. With a function as simple as it is functional in the plot, they dominate the stage and enjoy every minute - with dialogue that works almost like inside jokes with fans that bring nostalgia without sounding gratuitous.Not by chance, the script is full of situations to catch the audience by the heart. It's nostalgic to see Maguire talking about his MJ or even the brotherly look he gives Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) when they meet again, just as the way the story presents Garfield's Peter as this someone bitter for having been unable to save Gwen Stacy - and makes for a great redemptive moment for that. It's impossible not to vibrate with each of these references to the point where you want more movies for each of them. PFor this reason, it is easy to overlook some inconsistencies or things poorly explained. It doesn't matter why Electro (Jamie Foxx) has become so much more villainous than he was in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or even the swings the Lizard (Rhys Ifans) and Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) have in their motivations. All of this is easily overlooked in favor of the fun that this great party offers. This makes Homecoming like a big comic book come to life. In a story like this, you don't expect a big epic or anything like that, but a fun adventure that excites and leaves you excited at the end. And the new Spider-Man is all of that, even in the little things - from the appearance of Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) to the famous phrase ""With great power comes great responsibility"". The film delivers everything you expect.The classic Marvel formula humor is properly placed in the plot, working properly between these, highlighting the incredible return of Doctor Octopus by Alfred Molina, and the great and fun comic relief of the film, Jacob Batalon, playing Ned, best friend of Peter. And in addition to not having gained as much prominence in the two previous Spider-Man films, Zendaya finally earns her space, as well as becoming a beautiful and significant part of Parker's essence.Already the performance of Tom Holland is a major factor for everything to be even more fun and make the process interesting. He proves that he's not just a young man brimming with Spidey humor with no real problems. There's a sense of connection through every screen moment through his brilliant performance, underscoring that he's worthy of taking on the Peter Parker mantle for pop culture. Holland's growth is visible and rewarding, and is consecrated as his best performance to date in the MCU.The villains work very well together, however, there is no way to put aside and highlight Willem Dafoe's unique performance as the Green Goblin. The villain who marked a generation in the first Spider-Man movie starring Tobey Maguire shows in every way how timeless his relationship with the role is, even taking for himself, breathtaking action scenes. It's also visible how Jamie Fox grew up with Electro, gracing every screen moment he was present.Aware of the responsibility at hand, No Way Home comes to an end as a comic book adaptation that is not afraid to embrace more fanciful aspects. And he does it with pride, because he abandons the worry of looking cool or modern. It is curious that Marvel Studios, which usually fills its productions with clues to the future, has decided to look back on the Spider-Man case. After putting Peter Parker under the wing of several figures in its universe, the studio seems to finally have the courage to emancipate him, and it does so by celebrating a story built over nine films, dozens of cartoons and thousands of magazines.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","tallinnuk","15 December 2021","Points:1. Tom Holland, Zendaya, Andrew Garfield and the rest give 10/10 performances.2. Brilliant action with outstanding CGI given they had a year maybe less.3. May's death is a beautiful scene left for as long as it should have and Tom Holland is brilliant.4. Every character from the multiverse felt like themselves and Andrew's performance solidified his Peter as the most comic accurate.5. Even though it is a multiverse movie (which can get confusing) you still understand everything and it all makes sense.6. This is Tom Holland's film even with the two Spider-Men, they still make sure he is the main focus.7. The grief Peter goes through is perfectly pictured and Andrew's Peter described that he had that feeling after Gwen's death.Overall the best Spider-Man film and best MCU film to date.","

Seeing all these familiar faces was great and being there to witness it among fellow fans is unforgettable. The pure joy I felt seeing Andrew then Tobey is unmatched. Oh and the fact they killed Aunt May?! I can't believe they had the guts to do that. Poor Peter has lost everyone he's ever loved. And that ending! I have so many questions about what happens next for him. How do you live when nobody knows you exist? Movie was just fantastic. Perfect fan-service, nostalgic, heartbreaking, intense, and hilarious. Everyone was perfectly presented and got the necessary screen time (which endgame failed to properly do). I hope to never forget tonight and the way this made me feel. Thank you Marvel and Sony for redeeming Andrew's Spider-Man and bringing together the holy trinity. I still can't believe they did it.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","rockdude-68045","15 February 2022","In summary this movie was well received and for good reason because it's a solid good movie. With that being said it wasn't great and it wasn't the best spiderman movie. It heavily relied on nostalgia to carry the plot and development and while I can appreciate it all it didn't exactly climax as I was hoping for. Felt like the marvel series as of late just compiled into a movie instead of episodes.Tom holland uses up the last of his awkward teen spiderman attitude in a overdue effort for his character to finally start truly evolving. Yet it comes pretty slow over the course of this film. Additionally, the main conflicts in this movie basically are all spidermans faults when you really think about it which makes it even less of a plot arch due to the circular reasoning behind the movie.Nostalgically it carries the film for obvious reasons and while I loved what happens I feel like it wasn't as wholesome as I expected it to be.. I guess I just got a high expectation from all the great feedback of the film.There were some glaring issues with the plots reasoning and motivations but I get it. Overlooking some of those things it felt like this film was just a filler marvel movie to set up for the next phase and it showed up in its quality. Felt more like a movie special for tom holland instead of a side series that marvel did for loki, wandavision, wintersoldier, and hawkeye. Basically the same quality and effort except instead of a series you got a movie with nostalgia.It was still a solid film to watch but not exactly top tier from marvel. Still loved the nostalgic parts though! They might have carried this movie but it worked!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","slowcando","3 January 2024","No spoilers or plot-summary here. If you're a fan of all the Spider-Man movies of the last 20 years then stop reading reviews and go see! Otherwise...While Endgame was also a fan-service movie, the premise was acceptable, stakes felt tense, the characters acted 'in-character' and the whole production was pulled off very smoothly.No Way Home is similar in fan-service only, everything else doesn't match Endgame's quality:the premise is so blatantly contrived by Doctor Strange's out-of-character irresponsible illogical behaviour that I had trouble the entire movie suspending my disbelief. So much for him being 'the adult in the room'.the stakes never felt particular interesting. It was all a bit 'so what?'.Tom Holland's battered fish-out-of-water shtick is getting old. By the third movie the hero should be quite emotionally grown already.the attempted redemption of the villains only cheapens them as characters. If they have no agency, then they have no 'character'. Endgame had a similar problem when resetting Thanos's motivations but that character still felt like an epic threat, which is what we want from such movies. Otherwise, where is the tension or excitement gonna come from?the plot-resolution was so over-the-top and logically-ridiculous. We obviously accept a lot of nonsense from superhero movies, but they still require a certain quality of internal-logic, otherwise you can literally just make anything up.Overall not a bad film, of course. It was well-made, fairly entertaining despite the flaws. Pacing ok. Good work from the cast. Zendaya decent value again, tho' her character is morphing into the 'crying damsel/emotional sponge' trope. Some fun FX, even if the Mirror Universe was more interesting in the first Strange movie (and Peter Parker's ""it's just geometry"" to get the better of the Master of the Mystic Arts was eye-rollingly poor).From the three Spider-Man films only Homecoming was a really good one. The other two are skippable. No Way Home has a whopping 8.2 rating on here, which I think makes it the highest-rated MCU movie outside of Infinity War/Endgame. So I expect especially Spider-Man fans to love it. But for casuals who are looking for the quality of the best Infinity Saga movies...well, this one may be a disappointment.Personally, I'm almost done with Marvel, just gonna do the second Doctor Strange movie, and finish with Guardians 3. Not gonna bother with any of the series or other movies. The reviews seem middling, and this Multiverse arc isn't that interesting, frankly.","

There are so many existing stories which could be adapted yet they went with this. The popularity of this is depressing. The multiverse is ridiculous. The number of villains were ridiculous, The dialog of the 3 spider-men was rather bad at points. The McGuire Spider-man tells the Garfield Spider-man that he is amazing repeatedly. That was such a call-back to the previous movie titles that it motivated me to take a bathroom break.Since there are going to be multiple movies with multiverse as a key plot device, I am ending my interest in the MCU.","

As a result villains who he has killed return from across the multiverse. You are expected to know string theory. Their return causes havoc and Spider-man must find a way to cure them before Dr. Strange kills them.In the grand scheme of things, Marvel has gone out of its way to explain the other Spider-man movies when no one really wanted or expected one.

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jackransom-69832","15 December 2021","Easily the most anticipated and theorised comic book film since Avengers: Endgame. Spider-Man: No Way Home is set directly after the end of Far From Home. With Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. When the spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear.It was always going to be difficult for this to live up to the myriad of potential expectations that had built up in mine and millions of others heads after the first trailer released back in August. Luckily throughout its duration No Way Home excels at fan pleasing moments and truly giving Peter monumental stakes and potential consequences. However it is undeniably overstuffed and choppy, as well as for me personally a lot of the MCU'isms not always particularly gelling well with the returning villains.I will be keeping the plot details vague, but for those who had expectations and ideas of what the film might be, it probably is pretty much what you expect. The opening act ripple effect of Peter's identity being revealed, with he, MJ and Ned being turned down by colleges and constant harassment sets the stage well and understandably Peter's desperation for Doctor Strange to fix it. From there the rogues gallery pour through and it's up to Peter to stop them.Here is where some of my favourite aspects of the film are, as well as my irritations. It's undeniably great seeing these characters return to the big screen, and throughout the second act it is uniquely executed and delivers some satisfying interactions between the foes (though some of their motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out), as well as time to breathe. However it is once again the abundance of joke attempts and alterations to a couple of the characters that just make some of the interactions feel awkward and cringe inducing.Doc Ock's bridge battle is a standout return and the choreography, sound design and score all intertwine nicely. Holland wasn't lying about this being a darker and more violent entry into the franchise, with the first Goblin brawl being the film's highlight, alongside the jaw-dropping visual spectacle of the mirror dimension duel. The final action set piece is pure spectacle and grin inducingly fun, it's just a shame that yet again it's another CGI heavy sequence set at night, so it's frequently hard to see what's going on at certain points.This is probably Holland's best Spider-Man performance as he really has some emotional heavy lifting to do, as well as keeping the quips and enthusiasm fresh. Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the film. He's still got all of it: the grin, the laugh, the expressions and genuine menace. Molina as well, brilliantly capturing the commanding intelligence and personality of Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx is far better suited in this iteration of Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch adds a layer of bitterness and snark to Strange, yet keeps his core values and dedication to help in check.Spider-Man: No Way Home may just be the film many fans of dreamed of. Unfortunately for me, whilst it still delivered a lot of what I wanted, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. Dafoe & Molina prove once again why Spider-Man 1 & 2 will never be topped, the increased personal stakes for Peter are welcome and I'm still partially in awe that the film actually happened. However the leering presence of now extremely familiar and annoying MCU traits and tropes, certain character interactions and an overstuffed storyline do hold it back.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jackgdemoss","17 December 2021","Spider-Man is fantastic for 2 hours out of it 2.5 hour run-time. The finale certainly dwindles but that isn't the biggest fault. The problem for me was with it's over-abundant fan service and the disingenous marketing surrounding the movie.I don't usually mark spoilers but it feels necessary here. It felt like this was supposed to be the film that got the multiverse started beyond the Loki series, and it truly doesn't. It is an entirely self-contained story. Even the venom tease from venom 2 post credits does not come to fruition, and instead, just passes through to another post credits scene to further tease.The film did have mostly positives across the board which kept it at an 8 for me. In particular, I think this is the best sound design in a Marvel film to date. The punches, terrain shattering, and dialgoue were so crisp and distinct. The sound scape just felt right in every scene and I would love Christopher Nolan to take some notes prior to directing his next thriller.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","yoshbuck","8 June 2022","Although this movie has some horrible pacing, especially in the film's first half, where some scenes feel so abrupt, with that said, this movie slaps harder than me testing a fresh watermelon. I don't want to go in-depth cause there is a lot to unpack in this film. So I will say that this is one of the best Spider-Man adaptations and one of the most important. This movie has an excellent balance of humor and tragedy, heroism and villainy, and the vast characters this film brings. If this rating/review is about portraying the challenges a hero encounters and the actions they must make, and how they portrayed Peter Parker so well, this movie would be a 10/10. Without a doubt.","

Else, this was a very boring and stretched film. The thing about Maths overpowering superpowers was silly too. All the actors acted very well, but the premise of the film was comical. I liked the spell-scene which showed the limitation of 'spells'. I hope creators show their normal, day-to-day lives too, instead of clubbing multiple characters together. Spiderman has superpowers but is also desperate to enrol into an elite college? Isn't saving lives enough for our wunder-kid?","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","alekspredator87","25 July 2022","In the vast world of the Avengers, the appearance of Spider-Man performed by Tom Holland was greeted very warmly. The young hero is very much loved all over the world, and the successful Infinity Saga, which was just gaining momentum, was replenished with a famous character to please the public. Two solo albums followed, which were well received by the audience. Well, the announcement of the third film about Parker's life and his meeting with heroes from other universes raised interest in the upcoming film to the skies, perfectly playing on the fact that even fans of films with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield will also be interested in the project. The option really turned out to be a win-win, while giving the audience another high-quality story.The plot plot, however, looks kind of ridiculous, implicates Doctor Strange here. The magician and the magician reacts to Peter's request, in my opinion, somehow not in an adult way. But we all understand that if the magician had refused the young Spider, the story would not have happened at all (although everything is difficult here because of other projects, including Loki and Wanda/ Vision). Nevertheless, a certain solution triggers a chain of events that demonstrate a lot of interesting content on the screen.It cannot be said that the film was created exclusively for fans. The story is strong and allows Tom Holland's Peter Parker to grow up, rising to a new level. The dramatic events that meet the audience during the narration necessarily affect the personality of the young Spider, perfectly demonstrating that he will have to answer for any of his decisions on his own. He is no longer a teenager, and the stakes are high, often it's human lives. And if you have decided to act the way you acted, then be ready to answer for the consequences, even if it hurt your heart unbearably.This film shows well who and how of the characters moves further along their storyline. There are a lot of heroes and villains here, whose fate is really interesting to know. Well, the great trinity will definitely make you not only smile, but also worry about the fate of everyone, especially in the finale of the story. Viewers will see a reverent and respectful attitude towards the previous Spider-Man franchises. The presented characters will tell how they lived at a time that we have not been able to see on the screen, they will tell, it seems, everything that is needed to ensure that the audience has a general picture of their worlds.However, do not forget that this is still a film about the current Spider-Man. The picture will be focused on it. Holland has surpassed himself in terms of acting. A young man together with his hero turns from a teenager into a young man who is ready to live as an adult and independent person, having left the custody of older comrades. Finally, you begin to understand that in future tapes he will no longer need mentors, such as Tony Stark, Nick Fury, Happy Hogan or Stephen Strange. And after the end credits, you catch yourself thinking that the trilogy about the guy that happened is just the teenage period of Spider-Man. And the potential of his individual future stories is very great.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" has become a great blockbuster. It has everything you need for a successful movie. The stars have converged. The successful, but recently stalling Marvel cinematic universe has given fans of the past and present a really worthwhile project. The creators have successfully entered into their Fourth phase about the Multiverse a strong project that is directly related to it, and also thanks to an uncomplicated plot gave the world the opportunity to plunge into the past and see the heroes and villains they have loved for a long time, literally breathing new life into long-familiar images. All this made it possible to earn an excellent box office, prepare the ground for future projects about Spider-Man, and, most importantly, reminded and even taught young viewers important things. It is necessary to be responsible for every adult independent decision. Take it on your shoulders, learn from mistakes and understand that every person has them, even if it's Spider-Man.After all, ""the greater the power, the greater the responsibility.""8 out of 10.","

My only real quarrel with the film was that it spent too much time re-introducing the characters we already knew from previous movies and now timelines.

I used to go to the movies all the time, but due to the whole pandemic thing I have not gone in a long while and add to that crippling depression making going out for me a very difficult task. That being said, I am a huge Spider-man fan and I have seen all the Spider-man films in the theater so I managed to get out of the house for my off day from work rather than just staying in bed all day. I was rewarded with a very good film, full of action and nostalgia; however, that being said due to my state of mind it also made me severely sad and a bit suicidal. Just hard for me these days to fully enjoy anything with me growing older and life becoming a pointless endeavor. Still, I enjoyed seeing the old villains, especially Dr. Octopus as he is my favorite Spider-man villain from the comics.The story, Mysterio's message at the end of Far From Home has Peter hounded by the press, taken in by agents and ruins his and his friends MJ and Ned's chances of getting into MIT. So Spider-man goes to Dr. Strange's place where he asks if there is anything the good sorcerer can do. Dr. Strange says he can make everyone forget Spidey's identity, but while in the middle of casting, Spider-man keeps adding stipulations causing the spell to go out of control. Soon enemies of Spider-man from the multiverse emerge and Spider-man must round them up so that they can be sent back; however, our hero soon learns that they are going to die and he wishes to help him despite Dr. Strange's protests. Soon Spider-man finds himself in the need of help as things get there darkest and he finds two other allies to help set things on the correct course.The film is good, but it definitely did not help my depression one bit. Watching the scene where MJ was rescued almost had me burst into tears, as I remembered the scene from one of the other films and remembered my fiance who has since passed away was with me during this time. I also felt alone as Peter was and feel a sense of hopelessness as my life has no meaning, so while a good movie, it probably can hurt someone who is struggling with bad depression as I am. I was honestly hoping for a more happy type film to make me feel a bit cheered up more than one that made me go further down...So a great film, one of the better MCU films and my favorite of Tom Holland's Spider-man films. I honestly, though, would love to see Garfield return to the role for maybe another Amazing film as it was good seeing him as Spider-man again and it would be nice to see some closure for his Spider-man. Heck, I would not mind another Tobey one either as that series never did have full closure either! That one is probably less likely due to Tobey's age though. I will say my only real complaint of the film is the lack of a new villain, this being due to the fact Spider-man has a whole gallery of villains so having a new one would have been easy and would have given the film six Spidey foes making them sort of a Sinister Six! That would have been cool, but still an amazing film all the same.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","nsmiaroski","14 March 2022","I had no idea what to expect from this movie. The couple reviews I heard had only mentioned that No Way Home was ""surprising"". I was ready to be disappointed to say the least. However I quite enjoyed it. For awhile many people have wondered how the individual spider man movies fit into the same narrative and how they conceptualized it was impressive. Not to mention the fact that they were able to get the original actors from the other spider man movies.. Absolutely loved the banter between the spider men and the loyalty they had for their own story within their respective universe. I also liked the set up for continuation with another Doctor Strange movie. I hope we can see more of him in the future.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kemal-44877","4 February 2022","VFX and sound is awesome as always. However, the story is forgettable and hard to relate. Peter is very annoying for the whole first act and although he's there for the second and third act, somehow his presence disappears. I watched it on IMAX just to see if I'd enjoy it fully, but nope. I'd prefer Eternals over this one. There are some emotional moments that are nicely done. You feel the heartbreak for sure. Some moments on the other hand feels fake. Dr. Octopus talks too much that he becomes annoying as well. And I'll never understand why Peter lets them all out from the prison at once.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","therealjaysmoke","12 March 2022","OMG, the first hour thirty minutes was a total waste of time, senseless plot and actions, and Tom doing what he does best, being the worst spidey ever. And his two best friends couldn't act to save their own skin. Frankly, the movie wouldn't have survived more than 4 stars if not for Tobey and Garfield's presence. The whole plot was a flop to be honest, I can't understand why they would even go for it. I mean the idea was great but the execution was terrible esp the introduction of the two spideys. And how in the world did Spidey outsmart Dr Strange in his own world, but he couldn't handle a mere human like Green Goblin?! And he was able to scoop up MJ and make a run for it but he couldn't pick up Aunt May and rush her to the hospital? Absolutely childish. Don't believe all the amazing reviews, they are just diehard marvel fans.Question, do different people write the scripts for each Spidey because Garfield's lines are the best.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","nightcrawler-01053","29 January 2023","Given the second film I should've known better, but I wanted to give No Way Home a chance in the hope Dr. Strange could save it from the mediocrity that was Jake Gyllenhall as Mysterio. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.This film is so inconsistent with its tone it's honestly laughable. Peter Parker botches Strange's spell multiple times whilst he's mid-casting it even though Strange tells him not to? Since when did Strange become stupider than a 17 year old kid.Spider-Man then defeats Strange in his own dimension using geometry based maths... Um, what?Aunt May dies and then in the lab MJ asks Peter if he's okay and his immediate response is ""Yeah, I'm fine."" Um, what? Aside from the tonal inconsistencies it really is nothing more than yet another Marvel/Disney CGI borefest; where nothing that happens involving any of the villains is remotely believable as far as suspension of disbelief goes.All the incidental characters just behave and act as though everything's normal and fine and they haven't just been through or seen the most traumatic experience of their entire lives. It's all so utterly fake and inconsequential.Unfortunately, this is just like every other copy and paste Marvel movie that fails to engage its audience with characters that actually have emotional depth. As it stands, No Way Home is a soulless, vacuous slog that entertains to some degree, but doesn't show anything that comes close to being meaningful.","

Sheer nostalgia aside, it actually finally felt like a spiderman movie, and we all knew it was a long time coming. It is the perfect place and perfect way for tom Holland's web slinger to part ways from MCU and head off to sony and homestly no jard feelings there. Well no movie is perfect but this, this was damn close, almost as good as endgame. Trust me when you see it in the theatres the atmosphere is awesome with all the web heads around.And one does not go without watching the end credit and both of them completely awesome.It had been mere speculation but now finally seeing Charlie Cox's daredevil is awesome really awesome..

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Jonathanb-97","12 November 2022","I thought going into it that it was going to be a good movie. Unfortunately people spoiled that Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire where going to be in it and they were just, didn't know when they were going to be in what scene. It was a great movie and when those two other Spider-Man came out my theatre ereputed with cheers and I have never seen so many people cheer or shout since Avengers Endgame and it was amazing. This movie was definitely the best Spider-Man movie they have made and definitely beats the other two Tom Holland Spider-Man films. I do wish we would have seen them mention the name ""Sinsister Six"" as if you know the comics you would know what that means but it was nice too see villains from all three franchises just wish we would have saw more and more dialogue with them and there Spider-Man's. Side note would have been a 10/10 if they put more Daredevil in the movie more and not just one scene but overall 8/10. Overall great movie just need some minor changes.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","fciocca","28 September 2022","""No Way Home"" is an ambitious project that tries to unite Spider-Man fans of different generations and I have appreciated this effort. I am not against fan-service movies, as long as the plot is interesting and well developed. It is a film that overwelcome its staying, with a length of almost two hours and a half. I had to split the viewing on two different days, because I was getting really bored. There are tons of scenes that needed to be cut, as some plot points are completely useless. The premises are ridiculous: basically all the mess happening in the film is due to some Peter's whim. Therefore all the fights that we see against the villains were perfectly avoidable, if only Doctor Strange was a bit more responsible and would just clarify with Parker his intentions, before executing the spell. It baffles me that such a powerful sorcerer commits these mistakes, it does not make any sense.It is enjoyable seeing three different Spider-Men generations united in one great movie with their respective enemies to fight. However due to the excessive length, this meeting between Parkers came way too late, when my attention span was already really, really low. There are a few good moments between them, but there are many cringey jokes, worth probably of a preteen audience. Dialogues are cheesy and annoying. It is sad that screenwriters could not come with something a bit more creative and well thought out, especially considering that this was the big reunion that a lot of fans were waiting for a long time. It is a disappointing result that does not really add anything new to the big cinematic universe: once again the multiverse is mentioned, and finally we start to see a glimpse of some consequences of this topic on the MCU, but it is not enough, especially for a two hours and a half movie. If you are a die hard fan, maybe you will enjoy this movie more than I did. For me it was a wasted opportunity to do something really great.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","rgkarim","17 December 2021","LIKES:The Special Effects:
Disney's resources can be used to craft amazing pieces, and No Way Home shows just how much of the good stuff they have when they put their time and money to it. Spiderman's dive into the multiverse is beautiful on almost all fronts in both design and animation. Dazzling displays of light, color, flashing, and explosions are blended together to make exciting, comic book feeling moments, all while getting hit with darker layers as the fight progresses. Spiderman facing the various villains seen in the trailer are fantastic, as web slinging, dodging, and various blasting occurs to rock the screen with amazing, theater rumbling effects. It's a very cinema worthy movie for this alone, but there is so much more to it.The Comedy:
Disney is all about cramming the jokes into the movie to lighten things up, and sometimes they take it too far. Fortunately, No Way Home manages to keep the comedy in check, timing things at the opportune moments and hitting running gags to keep us ingrained in the MCU Spiderverse. The banter was mostly kept in check, each of the characters styles blended well together with awesome chemistry, and even better it was not too much to trip up the emotional moments this movie has, which is a fantastic balance for this reviewer.The Action:
For the most part, the fights and chases in this movie feel very much like something from the Marvel comic universe. Taking that classic Spiderman taunting, while implementing strategy, agility, and use of environment, led to some decent moments that were suspenseful and interesting to see what damage would be caused. As the movie's tone changed, the nature of the fights changed too to keep pace, and by the end it was an amazing blend of comedic, action, and emotion to paint a near perfect finale for me.The Acting:
Again, Marvel casted well in this movie and opens up so many great chemistry networks between the characters that were in this movie. Holland is still a wonderful blend of Peter Parker and Spiderman, who has taken the character again to further heights and pulls the character through the ringer. This movie puts the main character into the ringer and Holland does things so well to really grab that emotion and pull at your heart strings. Zendaya's quality still shines through, and her rendition of M. J. still holds the same core foundation, but starts to further evolve and grow the seeds planted at the end of Far From Home. Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is top notch as usual, he's fun, he's classy, and he really sets the stage for the future of the character in this bizarre multiverse being set up and is exciting to see this transition layering more onto the character. Jacob Betalon as Ned again rocks in the comedy moment, but also extends to some other moments that were again perfect for the story. Alfred Molena, reprises the role of Doc Oc super well, bringing the same narcissism intellect of the character, but diving back into the complexity of the character we had in the second movie. There are so many more to compliment, but I can't due to potential for spoilers, but rest assure that the chemistry between this cast is a mixture of quality.Handling the Characters Well:
Spiderman: No Way Home had a lot of balls to juggle and for me, they did it quite well with the material they had to present. Extending the story from the end of the last movie, while mixing in Strange felt very natural, with adequate time spent listing out the problems and solutions the two ""Avengers"" had to find for the spell that went wrong. And once that door was opened, the complexity of the story required a lot more planning and direction. Watts and the team succeeded, managing to keep a lot of characters in the mix and making sure their inclusion was meaningful past the simple marketing for toys. Even the villains get some decent balance, again bringing their own interactions and plot components that for the most part were not forced or counteractive. It was a fantastic display of coordination and effort and given the potential disaster this could have been, I'm very much happy with the results.The Emotional Heart:
These movies and characters mean the world to the fans, and that means crossing into the heartstring pulling territory. No Way Home hits this several times, and I loved the moral testing components that they wrote in here for so many characters. Diving deeper into these characters, we got past the simple good-guy vs. Bad-guy motif and instead got something much bigger that again justified the inclusion of so many things. This is certainly one of the clutch moments of the MCU and I dare say it was something that sets so much up for the rest of the wave.DISLIKES:Pacing at the beginning:
It's all about the set up and making sure we are ready for everything to happen in the movie. As such, that was the part of the movie that I found to be a little drawn out and boring at times for me. I don't know if I was just tired, or I was hoping for a little more movement or suspense and it took about the first thirty minutes before the first fight really kicked in. Once that happened, the pacing issues were very minor at that point, only going a bit fast a few times in how some of the twists were brought in.The Computer work at times:
As much as I enjoyed the special effects and CGI, I can't say that it was flawless. No Way Home does have moments where the computer look reared its head and took shortcuts into the less realistic looking realm. The very artificial movements, the digital look to the skin, and a few other moments did drop into the lower resolution. Again, a minor flaw for me, but something I have seen in the past get fans upset.The Action at Times:
There are times where the fighting really started to ramp up, finding a great pace and stride that was gearing up for a great Spiderman brawl. However, the action would then trip and lose that momentum with an abrupt ending. There were great moments where they achieved all those incredible fighting sequences, but there were times I would have liked a little more coordination and magic that we had with other films, especially at the end with the way they were solving some problems. It feels like they were running out of time and some cuts were made to offset the full coordination, but again this is still a nitpick moment for picking on to find the answer.Some of the Bad Guys Needed A Little More:
Doc Oc as I said earlier was a fantastic villain they did so much with and Green Goblin as well has the bite that feels like an extension of the classic character. However, the Lizard and Sandman (which have been seen in the trailers), felt a little more time was needed to further expand upon their characters more and give them the same bite they held long ago. I know the reasons they were brought in for the most part, but... there still could have been some more fun with them to help get a little more mojo and time with them would have been amazing.Predictable:
I got most of the twists they were trying to surprise us with. Lots of foreshadowing handed you the keys to getting the big events that were going to happen and how they were going to help repair the mess they were looking. I can't say that the call of things being a surprise were really a surprise. However, this minor dislike still does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie for me.The VERDICT:
Spiderman No Way Home achieved a lot of greatness for this reviewer and makes me feel a little more comfortable from what is coming out of Marvel in the future. It's a fun movie that has so much to it and really brings forth an amazing experience meant for viewing in the theater. It's exciting, it's got heart, it's got comedy, and it keeps many things in the air with a balanced manner that was certainly exceeding the expectations that I had going in. No Way Home shows the multiverse may be in good hands and if they can continue this art of balance of new ideas and foundations, then we are in good hands. Sure, there are some pacing issues at time, some simplified solution finding, and a few characters needing a little more time. However, overall, this film is in the top Spiderman movies and I strongly encourage you to see it in the theater if you can find the time.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","melwinbauer","15 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home is the latest blockbuster to arrive from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Spider-man's identity is revealed to be Peter Parker, whose life gets turned upside down, and he is faced with his greatest challenge yet.No Way Home is a great superhero film filled with amazing action, heart-wrenching emotional scenes, and incredible surprises. If you have watched Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame you will see many similarities. Both in the sheer scope of the film and in the epic nature in which it unfolds. In my theater the audience erupted several times, cheering and applauding.The action is hard-hitting and significantly more violent than previous Spider-Man movies from Marvel which adds something new and great to this film. The story is also great which both makes for an amazing movie and it paves the way for plenty of great movies to come. The movie also features the best performance from Tom Holland yet. He is finally coming into his own as Spider-Man and it is honestly amazing to see.Go see this movie immediately. Do your best not to get spoiled and see it in the cinema. You won't be disappointed. Spider-Man: No Way Home is the greatest Spider-Man movie I've ever seen and one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen as well. Overall a great film and I can't wait to see where the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes next.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","neil-476","22 December 2021","Peter Parker, outed as Spider-Man, and framed for Mysterio's death (see previous film), asks Dr Strange to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. But things go horribly wrong, and the multiverse suddenly gets very real indeed.The trailer reveals the Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 makes an appearance, thus linking the MCU with the original Spider-Man franchise, but it is worth watching all 5 pre-MCU movies beforehand because there are moments here which payoff all those movies.This is a very good movie notwithstanding the fan service. It's a good story, the action and effects are first rate, the performances are excellent, and there is a lot of emotion. Far From Home was very good, albeit a more intimate movie after the cosmic goings-on in Infinity War and Endgame, but No Way Home makes it clear that Phase 4 will be as capable of weaving intimate personal issues and massive threats as Phase 3 was.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","omgajjar-00698","8 March 2022","This movie can be said as one of the best film in the world. I mean like 'What a time to be alive!' for the fans of Spider-Man who grew up watching all the Spider-Man films in the cinema. It was a masterpiece combination of all Spider-Man films.When Doc. Otto Octavius first appeared in the movie and asked Spider-Man about his Machine of the power of sun, I was speechless and moreover, all the actors who played the role of villains of past Spider-Man films were still looking fit like they looked in the past films of Spider-Man.Another moment when I was speechless was when Andrew and Tobey showed up in the movie. Some of the scenes of three of them were quite entertaining like when they were talking about the villains they have fought and referring to all past Spider-Man films which gave me Nostalgic feeling of my childhood.The direction work done by Jon Watts was amazing but there was not much in the story plot when we compare it with Far From Home or EndGame, but still it was entertaining.This movie made the audience laugh, cry, feel angry, shock, feel nostalgic and much more so overall this movie is one of the best film ever made on the Earth.*BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY ELECTRO (MAX) WAS IN THE FILM AS HE DIDN'T KNEW THAT PETER PARKER IS SPIDER-MAN?*They should have been cast Dane DeHaan in the place of Jamie Fox as Harry Osborn (Green Goblin) knew that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.(Still saying it again) This film was totally entertaining for all Spider-Man fans!","

If you love any of the 2 previous versions you will most likely love this movie since there are a bunch of references and actors from those are returning back. Peter Parker also have good character growth at the end of the movie he doesn't feel like a kid anymore. He feel a lot mroe mature and finally is standing on his own legs.

This is the best profomance as Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet!! Can't wait to see more of what he can do with this beloved character. The story is so emotional in many feels and it's grounded very well! I never thought as a Spider-Man fan would love this film as much as I did as a kid growing up! It's the greatest Marvel movie of all time and it will forever have a special place in my heart. Well done Marvel and Sony. Thank you for giving us a Spider-Man endgame that delivers!","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","ladymidath","16 March 2022","It was so great to see all the main villains back and all the original actors, plus the three Spidermen and Dr Strange. This was a Marvel happy meal. Spiderman No Way Home was perfect. It was such a treat seeing them all bouncing off each other and Dr Strange. I am not going to go into a synopsis of the movie as there are plenty of reviews doing just that so I don't need to. Needless to say, this is the best of them so far. The performances are brilliant, you can see how much fun everyone is having here. The action is great and it really does ties things up nicely.This is definitely a must see for fans of comic book movies and for people who just love great movies.","

I wanted better.This is a very big ""fan boy"" movie, so I understand why so many people are gushing over it. However, for me I found it:boringway too longnot very funnylacking an interesting plottoo many ""villains"" for one moviehaving really bad CGI (in some parts)The audience clapped every time (insert some character from a past movie) appeared on screen. That's fine, but that shouldn't be the whole substance of the movie.I liked the scenes with Dr. Strange more than the scenes with Spider-Man. Unfortunately, Dr. Strange isn't in the movie very much.If you like a lot of call backs to other movies, then you'll love this film. If you want more than a surface-level story, then you may be wanting more after seeing this movie.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","vipham941","23 December 2021","I'll be honest, I was going this expecting the hype around the film to exceed its quality but it was delightfully surprising.Despite knowing the biggest and most exciting twist of the film (thanks internet), the film managed to surprise and deliver.With the absolute stand out performance of Tom Holland as Spider-Man and the surprise appearance of a few familiar faces, the film delivers in an action packed yet still emotionally powerful way quickly and easily becoming the best of the MCU's Spider-Man movies.The only real criticism I have of this film is it's reliance on past characters and films to carry the narrative of the film. Rather than coming up with new ideas for Spider-Man and the future of his character in the MCU, they chose to rehash old favourites. Whilst I understand that to a certain extent, it is a little disappointing to see so much of the film hinge on it.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","imiea","16 December 2021","""Where do we go from here?"" is the biggest question I have after leaving the cinema. The possibilities are endless both for Spiderman and the MCU as a whole.Firstly, this movie absolutely delivers on so many levels. So often, the hype for a film could leave you disappointed but not this one. Fan service is at the very core of No Way Home but at the same time it ties in beautifully to what we're seeing with this new phase of MCU projects.With all the craziness, epic moments, secrets and reveals, I was worried this movie will take the attention away from Tom Holland's Spiderman but if anything it just adds to his story arch and sets up an amazing potential future for the character. I honestly can't wait to see what comes next for Spiderman and Peter Parker. Holland does a fantastic job and we really get to see just how good of an actor he is in this movie. No Way Home is filled with fantastic visuals and plenty of emotion, and in classic MCU style, thrilling action, your usual one liners and (not always, but definitely in this film) a storyline that keeps the Marvel steam train running at full force.There are many scenes in this film that will leave long time Spidey fans feeling like a kid again and is exactly what you'd expect it to be. The feeling of joy, nostalgia, excitement and to some extent, relief, was truly magical and I'm forever grateful to have experienced it. It would be extremely difficult to ever witness something like this on the big screen again. Thank you Marvel, and thank you Sony.In my opinion, there are some areas in the film 's storyline where it suffers a bit. Some of the character's decisions are a bit Strange (no pun intended) in parts with certain events being questionable. But then again, that's the tricky part with these films. It's science fiction and you can never read too much into the details. Sometimes its best to just accept it for what it is, which in this case, is an epic superhero adventure.Despite the VERY minor questionable plot details, No Way Home is undoubtedly a phenomenal film that will go down as one of the greatest superhero films of all time. It is a true love letter to Spiderman fans and an event that will surely open up a multitude of possibilities for the MCU.","

The Avengers are all but diminished and the new Avengers are being shaped for what seems to be formidable challenges ahead as we enter into a Multi Verse of the Universe were what came before will seem like a drop in the ocean on more levels than one. Very enjoyable great concept and brilliant cinematic magic, I was losing hope for this genre but it seems we have turned a corner lately and I have enjoyed The Ten Rings and this Spider-Man a lot more so I say more of the same please.......","

It's just not that, everything in the movie made sense.. it wasn't just something that you will like just because of your favourite heroes. This movie is packed with each and every element, a roller coaster of emotions. In these 2.5 hours you'll laugh, cry and scream. Overall, This movie ended up being way above my expectations.. I was really waiting for some good old marvel movie after Avengers-endgame but this one is just something else. If you are a Spiderman/marvel fav go and watch this as soon as you can.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","jdowney-57-371157","10 May 2022","I am pretty stunned that this movie is as popular as it is. It's basically a contrived gimmick to pull together the characters from past Spidey incarnations and crack a lot of jokes.I have never been a fan of Tom Holland's take on Spiderman as a good hearted teen-ager being overly deferential to every adult he deals with. It's a one-note performance and from the start it's been contrived and unconvincing. Andrew Garfield relied on looking at the ground and foot-shuffling when he was trying to portray Spiderman. Holland just calls everyone 'Sir' all the time.So...in a stupid corny contrived scene, Spiderman can't shut up long enough to allow Dr. Strange to cast a spell and everything is set in motion. Dimensional reality is breached and the other Spider Men from other Universes wind up in the new Spider Man's reality. So do all the old baddies from the old movies. Doc Occ/Goblin/SandMan/Electro/Lizard Man. So the three Spideys + Zendaya and her giant nose and Spider's Nerd Pal join together to correct the histories of multiple universes and they succeed but at a huge cost.There is a ton of 'jokey' humour in this junk food burger that doesn't work. There are standard Marvel CGI effects. There are a strangely bunch of complacent half-hearted no motivation baddies.The whole thing is horribly contrived, doesn't make sense, the characters don't act in sensible fashion, and our Hero is left with nothing but his super-hero identity....which we are left with the idea that that is all he needs because it is his destiny.Plot wise this movie was as bad as The Eternals. It is basically a movie for kids I guess. Fundamentally it was simple, stupid, contrived. Like a Big Mac, it filled you up, left you sluggish and wishing you had eaten something of better quality.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","kgprophet","18 December 2021","While this third movie in the latest trilogy of Spiderman films will more than placate the fanboys and fangirls out there, it is at a cost. This movie could have easily clocked in at two hours and feel like the perfect blockbuster movie. But no. After the finale, the ""good byes"" stretch on and on. Then of course there is baiting for other upcoming MCU movies. Even the fun jokey jokey scenes that are the hallmark of this franchise get cringe-worthy sometimes. I still give this movie a thumbs up, because it took a concept and found some fun with it. There is a little bit of manipulation, with more than a few tear jerker scenes (really? How many times do you need to push the waterworks?). But the biggest thing this movie has going for it is re-thinking the villains. Instead of the villains arriving and being bad guys, we find a way to make them sympathetic, and the audience will go along with the alternate storyline.I also like Benedict Cumberbatch. He fares well as a secondary character that only appears in the movie every once in a while. At the heart of the success of this current iteration of the Spiderman franchise is the friendship, particularly MJ and Ned. They stay integral to the center of the story quite intentionally, so you feel this is more of an ensemble piece that the previous two movies. However, the expected fan service (rumors are true) takes over and becomes the twist in the story. The concept of multiple universes has been pushed by Marvel for the last couple years, and here it is used as a vehicle for conflicts that arise.So I enjoyed the story, the treatment of the villains, plus the high buck action scenes we expect, and the supporting characters. For that reason, I will declare this film is the best of the three. Just get ready for some tugs at the heart in the third act, where you may find yourself getting a little annoyed that another music cue (the solitary piano notes with the sad violin) is making you well up again.I will give this a 7 out of 10, despite the extra half-hour of hugging.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Dello_","17 December 2021","On the surface Spider-Man: No Way Home is highly entertaining, funny and with some heartfelt moments and all contributes to a satisfying view. It is great too see again some old villains and in general there is a lot of fan service but is done well and it's not annoying. The movie is also able to trigger people reactions and if you watch this movie in a passionate theatre the experience will be great because you can hear the sounds of the people around you, and it was something that I didn't experience since the pandemic has started and it was nice. You'll probably walk out from the viewing with very positive vibes and with high levels of satisfaction. BUT if you start think about it with a more critical view the magic will vanish because nothing makes sense. The premise is so stupid and the movie happens because Peter had suddenly become retarded, and not only him. Things happen because we will never know (like the reason for the return of the villains, the movie tries to give an explanation but in reality doesn't). And realistically what is the probability that between an infinite number of universes could happen exactly what has happened in the movie? How fortunate we were! And also the finale (that is very very satisfying and emotional) comes from a sudden change of the rules established previously in the movie. And so you can see that everything is only a pretext to please fans but without a real structure or a good premise behind it. The plot is useful only for the fan service. And if on one hand it is what has made my watching an experience, it is something that has to be noted. And so I am divided between my fan nature that has liked this movie and my rational and objective nature that dislikes it because of the nonsense of the plot. And so in conclusion what I can say is: go watch it for the experience without expecting a good movie, only a collection of cool scenes.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","guskeller","17 December 2021","Spider-Man: No Way Home is clever fan service. The usual MCU self-references are present, but No Way Home takes a step further, acknowledging previous Spider-Man eras as its central story. Turning references into legitimate plot points deserves credit. Furthermore, the cast is truly stunning and the main selling point here. The film successfully brings all these eras together and gives everyone time to shine. Naturally, this all helps the acting too because the excellent cast clearly enjoys their roles. Add in the patented MCU filmmaking baseline, and the result is a surefire hit.However, No Way Home's gimmicks do not make a masterpiece. On a technical level, the film is still basic MCU. Occasionally, there is abstract sound and visual craft, but those aspects are mostly standard. The same goes for the editing, music, and production, which all meet (but rarely elevate) the material. Lastly, the writing and direction both get lost in the massive shuffle. This is the most epic MCU Spider-Man, and, unfortunately, the least heartfelt. The tone isn't focused and the emotional beats aren't earned. The attempts are decent, but don't resonate amongst the excitement. Nevertheless, No Way Home is certainly everything the fanboys want.Writing: 6/10

Tobey and Andrew coming back was also great and it was good to see 3 generations of Spider-Man coming together.

So this feels like scripted by an AI of Apple, studying 5-year olds.All this being said, one will watch it nonetheless, because it is over rated, to the point it made it to top 250. But on the way our it will end it in the Marvel pile of movies, where it rates as about as average, maybe an inch above.So for me these movies rank as 4/10, with these new copycat at 5/10.

Sure, it was enjoyable but I was expecting something spectacular waiting anxiously on the edge of my seat. But, in the end i was so far from dissapointed. This movie truly has everything a good ""superhero"" movie can have. Lots of great friendship and love scenes, fight scenes and those really, really intense scenes. But the thing that makes this movie stand out the most is because spiderman carries the sense of humanity. This movie made me cry, laugh, irritated and even a little bit angry sometimes and that's what makes it so great. The emotions made it the best spiderman movie so far. One moment that really made me cry was when Garfield (spiderman 3) catches MJ, not wanting Holland (spiderman 1) to feel the same sorrow he felt for Gwen. I also feel like you get the most out of this movie if you've watched all of the spiderman movies made, it gets you really sentimental.If you haven't seen this movie yet then you really have to as soon as you can, one of the best movies i've seen this year.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","sebastianschlicht","7 March 2022","There you go, Marvel, it's possible! After ""Avengers Endgame"" the quality of most MCU films was extremely disappointing in my eyes. Neither films nor series could really convince me. But my last hope rested on the third and (for now?) last ""Spider-Man"" film with Tom Holland. And who would have thought it, but ""No Way Home"" (2021) made it! The film refreshed the MCU and in my opinion is the best thing Marvel has done in a long time in so many ways. But where do you start with this film? Difficult, because it's hard to tell anything about the story without spoilers, so I'll go into spoilers later, but of course point them out first.Peter's identity was revealed by Mysterio and now he has to live with the consequences. His personal life is over, but so are his friends MJ and Ned. And if that wasn't enough, many people believe that Peter killed Mysterio. Spidey sees no alternative but to seek out Doctor Strange. Because he might have a solution for his problem...It's almost impossible to go into the film without any prior knowledge, because the trailers alone tell you very clearly what to expect. But of course they don't reveal everything, which I at least welcome. Still, I recommend anyone who hasn't seen the trailer (if thats even an option for anyone) to avoid it and go into the movie as fresh as possible.""No Way Home"" is the third film in this still quite young trilogy, which actually doesn't really work without the ""Avengers"" films (and many other individual films from the MCU), but you can say that we all have a real, complete Spider-Man series for the first time. Both the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield films ended quite openly. And while Tom Holland will certainly continue, this film is a kind of conclusion for the Avengers-Spidey.The story in this film takes on unexpected dimensions and for a long time I had the feeling that there were real stakes. I noticed that especially with the action. A lot of Marvel movies have those clearly defined action moments that are meant to look cool and epic (so you can put them into the trailers), but here the Peter Parker story came first. Each scene seemed like a natural progression from the one before, and I really liked that. I also think it's great that Tom Holland's character has to face the biggest challenges since Thanos. It's his film and his story. And it has never been as good as it is here. Holland is a great actor who has been fantastic as Spider-Man so far, but it's only here that I think he really matures into a character. The rest of the cast is great too, I really like Zendaya and Jacob Batalon in this film and they also develop into fleshed out characters.But that's not all: The action and the visuals of the film have improved. While technically good, the first two Spidey films were never as impressive as Sam Raimi's trio. Here, however, some people seem to have really thought about it. ""No Way Home"" is visually very impressive, wild and at times beautiful. Michael Giacchino (again) does a great job with his score and lets the Spidey theme sound really powerful with a few moments of goosebumps.The film isn't quite perfect, as many logic gaps are opened up in order to advance the story. BUT: That never bothered me because the fun, the emotions and the huge surprises were more than worth it. A movie has to entertain me and ""No Way Home"" did that every second. And that's exactly why I forgive the film's small weaknesses. Also, in an MCU film with magic and spider powers, you have to accept some supernatural and crazy things.But from here I have to enter spoiler territory. So if you haven't seen the film yet, you should NOT read on and jump to the conclusion. Here's your warning, so go ahead!SPOILER Alert!It was clear from the trailers that there would be an overlap with the previous Spidey universes. But even before that, there was speculation, fantasizing and there were first leaks. I think that's why everyone wanted to see this film. But despite all the fantastic appearances, ""No Way Home"" is still a film that not only does (great) fan service, but creates a new story with old characters. Especially the villains from the Raimi and Marc Webb universe refresh the whole thing nicely. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe as Osborne are the stars here, but Jamie Foxx as Electro also gets a new take on his character. Sandman and the Lizard are there and the actors (Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans) give their voice for them, but the ending shots with the actors were (unfortunately) used from earlier films. At least we get to enjoy J. K. Simmons again as J. Jonah Jameson. This time he is a paranoid maniac who spreads consiracy theories, but it works.In addition, the idea that all villains should be healed is really great. No typical good versus evil, but Holland's Peter Parker wants to give these antagonists a new chance. At the same time, however, he is also struggling with the consequences of his leaked identity.But what would this film be without the appearances of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield? How much I wished for that and it came true. And both aren't just simple cameos, they both have integral roles in the story. And this is where the magic of the film comes into play. Something like this will probably never happen again, it's unique. And I never thought that Marvel could make me feel this overflowing enthusiasm again, like last time in ""Endgame"". Seeing Tobey Maguire again as Spider-Man was magical. And Garfield gets to save MJ in free fall, bringing some closure to his trauma with Gwen. Absolutely fantastic!The question is, of course, is it possible to see and enjoy the film without the Maguire and Garfield films? Yes. But of course the effect without these films isn't even remotely as great. And honestly, what Spidey fan hasn't seen the other movies? There's even a small, funny reference to Miles Moralis.SPOILERS end!Conclusion: What a movie. What a Spider-Man movie. ""No Way Home"" was the most fun I had in the cinema since ""Endgame"". Marvel still has this magical potential somehow and director Jon Watts got almost everything out of this story. An absolute festival that entertained and touched me like hardly anything else in 2021!","

Whats with all of them knowing they where going to die, dd they revive? Why not at the end make people forget about Spiderman and not Peter??Don't think is very rewatchable, but had a great time. (even tho I knew the other Spidermen where going to appear, why no one talked about the bad guys or Murdok, that was a surprise to me and I watched like a year and a half of its release)","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","classicsoncall","6 January 2022","I believe this film entered IMDb's 'Top 250' at number #9, briefly rose to #8, and has now settled down into the 17th spot as I write this, right between ""The Matrix"" and ""Goodfellas"". I go on this little rant every time a new comic book super-hero movie comes out, because in anyone's wildest imagination, this cannot possibly be the 17th best movie of all time. Not that it will stay there as time goes by, but it just boggles my mind how a movie's audience and IMDb voters can impact a film's standing when it first comes out. Anyway, enough of that.For me, I thought the picture was quite a fun and entertaining experience. The idea of the two former Spider-Man actors returning to the big screen to help out Tom Holland's current depiction of the character was just a marvelous touch. Combined with many of the past Spidey villains and that quick cameo by Charlie Cox as Attorney Matt Murdoch made this an exciting and unexpected pleasure. Anywhere else the whole multiverse concept could have been a huge bungle, but the screenwriters here did a competent job of melding the disparate universes into a cohesive story that didn't seem far fetched within the context of Spider-Man's comic book history.With over four thousand reviews already posted here for this movie, there's not a whole lot I'm able to add to the discussion. Just know that if you go see this movie, it will quite likely exceed your expectations via creative story telling and superb visual effects. In other words, it's what you go to the theater for.","

They knew exactly what the fans wanted and likewise expected; and No Way Home delivers beyond the enormous hype. Not since Captain America wielded Thor's hammer in Endgame has a cinema erupted with such joy and vivacious cheering.And never have I smiled so much: NWH is bursting with delightful chemistry, Easter eggs, truly impeccable fan service and a never ending supply of fun and emotion in equal measure, all of which helps to elevate NWH in becoming the most joyous and ambitious entry in the MCU thus far.Spider Man has truly become something of an icon; and No Way Home, if nothing else, is a jubilant celebration of Peter Parker and his alter ego, including both his comic and onscreen iterations (past and present).9.5/10.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","AfricanBro","21 December 2021","This first part's not about the movie itself but the experience I had which I'll now always associate with the movie now. Okay so I bought 4DX tickets and it was my first time, it's crazy man. The seat started moving around like a roller coaster, wind was blowing, when the scene was somewhere cold in the movie the cinema got cold all of a sudden, water was being sprinkled everywhere, chair was vibrating and moving all over my back. The wind and water was coming from different directions, hit me behind my ears, in my face from the from the seat infront, from the sides, under and behind my ankles. I expected it, but was still really stunned. And I got a large Pepsi which I finished in about 20min and didn't pee before the movie, which is 3hr long if you consider the cinema ads in the beginning, so halfway through I had to pee really bad and the seat was throwing me around, my bladder hurt so bad😂 didn't want to miss a thing so I had to wait for the movie to end and people were staring at me all weird 'cause I was the only one leaving since we all wait for the post credit scenes😂 there are two of them.But my outtake from the movie, what stood out the most to me is Tom Halland is really good at playing sad scenes, every time I see him sad or crying I feel like I wanna cry too, the African in me doesn't allow it but I do. That Andrew Garfield scene also made me wanna cry. Spider-Man's not one of my favorite heroes but I think this is one of the best movies marvel has made so far, and I love how each of the Spider-Mans all brought back the same feeling their individual movies had back then, it was great to see. Not really a complaint but I wasn't really convinced Dr. Strange was that oblivious to the consequences of what he and Spider-Man were doing, he accepted doing the favour way too easily and didn't seem surprised when everything went haywire; and can't really blame it on the acting because Cumberbatch is astounding so I'll assume it's a ""giving thanos the time stone"" kinda situation. Unlike some MCU movies, this one didn't make the fan theories seem bonkers.The movie's quite long and takes you through different emotions, I got happy, then sad, then surprised then sad again and I think good movies should do that. Recent trend in superhero movies is to make them more comedic and I love it but thought was getting a bit too far because I think movies like Let There Be Carnage should have been much darker and gory, with a higher rating like R 18 even with the funny bits, not to say the same about Spider-Man, but i think they got the comedy-drama-action blend perfectly here. I was honestly surprised it's maintaining a 9/10 rating even after being released a couple days but it is as good as they say.","

"Spider-Man: No Way Home","Laura_Ratings","14 March 2022","Definitely an amazing movie. The reunion was so special to see, it was wonderful to see the previous 2 spidermans in this movie. I really, really loved it. It proves that it is not always bad to bring back some of the elements, characters or even actors from the previous movies. It takes skill to implement old elements, treat them with respect and make them turn out great in a new movie. The fact that Andrew's Peter Parker saved this universe's MJ was a touch that must have had long-time fans (me included) grabbing for tissues.Other than that I can't wait to see the next movie. I think Tom is a great Spiderman, though all 3 of the actors are the best Spiderman, there simply isn't one who is better than the other. They all portrayed the character in amazing but different ways and it's lovely to see them together to notice their impact.Furthermore, all performances in this movie were great, I really can't think of any bad points in this movie. Definitely recommend watching.","

from a spider man movie. Great devolpent, cool fight scenes between spider man and the villains and it had great aspect of opportunity's. The way they handled the villains was great, every villain got their time on the screen and didn't use any of them to continue the plot. The villains wasn't useless and they put great aspects to the story witch was very satisfying. Too see villains like dock ock and Green goblin again on the big screen, just blowed my mind.I'm so great full now that we get to see a fully developed Spider-Man/Peter Parker in this film. I was so angry at marvel just how porley they have written this character and in every movie he is in i started to question WHO IS THIS GUY? I'm truly sorry for the Tom Hollands fan but his spider man is far from great, he hasn't have any cool moments in the MCU that we can remember years later. But in this film i was more entertained of how mature he is now after fricking six films. It was good that aunt may died so he can go through grief and finally redeem himself. After the film I was hyped to see Peters next chapter.There's a few scenes that bugs me out and that's of course the jokes and a few didn't land and the writing seemed bad sometimes during the movie, but that's just a nitpick.The amazing part of the movie was that we did explore the so called multi verse and in someday many characters will clash together from other universes, we did see that in this film and oooooooooo boy I was screaming like a baby. Too see the three generations of spider men clashing together to stop the villains was just breathtaking to see. I loved every second of it and just to see Andrew and Tobey back was emotional. Tobey is my favourite spider man but during the film I was most hyped about Andrew, because I wondered how they were going to handle his character after Gwens death. I'm glad to say this that this film full field Andrews spider man. To see his redemption gave me goosebumps.10/10.",NA
"Avengers: Infinity War","RJBrez","24 January 2021","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end. Enjoy!","

Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.","

Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Abdulxoxo","5 February 2021","Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.
Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Puroo","21 April 2021","It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Filmdokter","25 October 2021","#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Jesper2801","26 April 2018","I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas. I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony. I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","shawneofthedead","25 April 2018","Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Platypuschow","4 May 2018","Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film","

"Avengers: Infinity War","cartermain","20 January 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours.

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheLittleSongbird","2 May 2018","Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"Avengers: Infinity War","garethvk","24 April 2018","Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.
The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.
With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.
Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.
What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.
There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.
I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.
Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.

"Avengers: Infinity War","jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","12 June 2018","Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips. There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","ACollegeStudent","17 December 2021","Rating: 9.0This went where no other mainstream superhero movie went and killed everyone, allowing Thanos to win. The biggest flaw I can think of with this is that there are other ways to achieve Thanos's goal without killing everyone, and there were some plot grievances like Corvus Glaive somehow sneaking all the way to Shuri in the battle unnoticed, and them not just digging under Wakanda's shield to begin with (they did later in the battle). Also, destroying an infinity stone should cause the universe to collapse in some way as explained in Endgame about taking stones from universes, so I'm not sure why none of the main cast raised this issue when destroying the mind stone was ratified into their gameplan (they might have not known better, though). Otherwise, great pacing, a great soundtrack, crisp visuals, seamless comedy, a compelling and humanized villain, and a haunting ending.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Dello_","6 September 2021","Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","pjgs200","12 May 2018","I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Horst_In_Translation","4 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once.I think that movies, especially superhero films, often stand and fall with their villain and here we have Thanos played by Josh Brolin as the main antagonist and he is just utterly great and memorable. Maybe you could say that his (self-perceived godly) ambition to erase half the planet is a bit too mathematical, but everything else about him is outstanding and I have virtually no doubt that he will end up as one of the most memorable villains of the movie year 2018. Even in his weaker story lines, like the part with his ""daughter"" that does not feel entirely convincing early on, he shines and elevates the material to a level where it really saves this entire part of the movie. So yes huge thumbs-up for Thanos. And another thumbs-up for virtually everybody else. Except Starlord unfortunately because honestly his grief may have been huge, but the how he basically destroyed the Avengers' effort that had them close to victory was just ridiculous, so to some extent you can blame him for billions of people dying eventually. Or are they really? I believe there will be a new Avengers movie in 2019 by the same team of writers and directors, so the ending may not be as finite as it seemed to be. You can almost call it a duology. Is all hope really lost? We have to wait a year and see. Honestly I doubt it because there will be a Black Panther 2 for sure at some point, so I guess they will find a way to get things right again for the good guys. It will also be interesting to see if they bring back those who died earlier too, not just those that vanished at the very end.Anyway, this film we have here is one that will make a huge impact come awards season 2018/2019 in all technical categories, especially Visual Effects where it is maybe a lock for an Oscar nomination with a great chance to take home the win. Another thing I would like to say about this film is that it is also a triumph in terms of the comedy, which is not always a success in Marvel works. But here there are some really hilarious scenes and as many bad things as I said about Chris Pratt's character earlier, his banter with Thor is hilarious. And there is a lot more of course. Drax is also amazing in that one scene where he stands there doing nothing. You will recognize many other pretty funny moments when you see them. So what is it that made this film so amazing. I would say it is the script this time. It is bold, daring and not scared of anything while never becoming too absurd or unrealistic (and yes that is possible for superhero films *cough* Deadpool *cough* glad we did not see him in here). But the outcome here is the exact opposite of too many cooks spoiling the broth, both character- and writer-wise. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this one and good thing is you really don't need to have seen any other Avengers or Marvel movie to appreciate the quality we were given with this one. I am truly very curious about the sequel and cannot wait to check it out. This third Avengers movie is my favorite 2018 release at the point of April. And it has a huge chance to stay in the top5, probably top3 until the end of the year. It never dragged, which is always a success for this running time and it gets better by the minute the longer it goes. And the way things turn out eventually reminded me a bit of the last Wolverine film ""Logan"". Happy endings are no longer essential. Realism is what it is all about. Highly highly recommended.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","MrDHWong","25 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10","

"Avengers: Infinity War","numenorsniper-66396","25 November 2021","I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","r96sk","23 January 2021","This is exactly the sorta thing I want from an Avengers film! Full blown, no punches pulled action. In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!Despite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.Like 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.Speaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.There are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.Needless to say, I can't wait to see 'Avengers: Endgame'!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","vengeance20","8 May 2018","Seriously when are these editors going to get their crap together & cut it! Hm? You don't need to drag a film on & on for what seems like an eternity! Cut the crap! Cut it! Get to the point already!!As usual, story-line was confusing, too wrapped up with own issues other than saving peoples lives, which is what these films have missed the point of over time, not to mention bad editing, & poorly executed narrative. They weren't speaking English as I had no idea what they were talking about half the time or should I say most of the time! Maybe if they cut the cra[ & made the film snappy it probably would've made more sense & instead of dragging the climax out in such a choppy changing like manner (what climax, I'll get to that later) anyway, as well as repetitive, the climaxes ending was all over the place! Bad guys gets ""killed"", comes back again, gets killed, comes back, more chopping & changing, then a slow dragged out scene, then back to the climax! The end outstayed its welcome, & well as soon as it got to the 2hr mark, you knew they need to wrap it up, but it took another 40mins to do that! Damn!And the ending... don't make me laugh!! The ending could've happened much much sooner! So much so they dragged out a climax for this? I mean the ending was an insult alone, without the other reason being that it took them nearly an hour till they gave us this pile of horse crap! Oh my god!!Overall crap! DON'T watch! 2/10","

This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","lisafordeay","6 May 2018","OK I loved the sequel Age Of Ultron as it focused more on the Avengers themselves but I will get into the negatives later.Avengers Infinity War is the prequel to the 2015 film and tells the story of the Avengers who are no longer working together and must try and defeat a giant half monster/ human called Thanos (Josh Brolin)who wants the stones known as the infinity stones. Each one makes Thano more powerful and it's up to the team to somewhat get back together and join the guardians of the galaxy(Chris Pratt, Zoe Salvada,Bradley Cooper). Will they stop Thano?The special effects are very good along with the cinematography. However the film itself is 50/50 for me. The downside of this film was that there was too much going on and I was so dissapointed with the hulk played by Mark Ruffalo as you never see him as the hulk at all this time. Jermery Renner who played Hawkeye was absent in this and the film was so hard to follow e.g what happened to Thor's eye. I felt like it was skipping or whatever.Overall do yourselves a favour and watch the 2015 version instead or try and watch all the Marvel films to get used to the story.Also has Tom Holland,Robert Downey Jr,Gwyneth Paltrow,Don Cheadle,Chadwick Boseman,Karen Gillian and even a cameo by Stan Lee.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","blparker-31738","27 April 2018","All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheBigSick","4 May 2018","SPOILER: The plot is simple that the supervillian succeeds, but Russo brothers waste too much time on piling up the superheroes. The film is just too long, and you keep looking at the watch to see when it will end. There are too many characters, and if you did not view the previous Marvel films, you would hardly get any sense of who they are. It is an OK film for Marvel fans, but chaos for a general audience.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Prismark10","3 May 2018","When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","saraccan","11 May 2018","If i can somehow oversee the fact that this is just another glorified cgi fueled version of wwe, its an okay action movie.It's still very much soulless, incredibly predictable and nothing that happens in this movie matters in any way because there can be infinite amounts of prequels and/or sequels and also, certain people can control time in any way they desire. I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters.Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of ""wait, where are we?"" or ""wait, why are they fighting again?"". This one felt more compact to me. GOOD JOB!That said i still don't care about anything that happened or will happen in these superhero movies. I did pay for a ticket and therefore contributed to the financing of future films though, so you're welcome.","

The Hulk grapples with Thanos and is overpowered to the point where he is afraid to come out through Banner? Are you serious? Where is CA? He lost his razor AND his shield? Are you serious? Most of the things I expect from the Avengers were absent in this film. There was very little working together to defeat a Foe; and way too much about the Bad Guy -- Thanos. Like, why do I care? Thanos is the Bad Guy, so defeat him and move on! Then the Ending --- utterly pathetic!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","RNMorton","9 May 2018","Two other titles came to mind as I watched this. ""The sum is much less than the parts"", and/or ""Way too much on the plate"". As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.","

Then there are products is one soap powder really better than this other, or a $1000 perfume can it really be better say than one at a mere $10, beauty they say is in the eye of the beholder! So they say. Then there is this new mega movie Avengers Infinity War, now i would take issue with anyone that this is actually a movie at all, it is a consumer product the must see/ have accessory for the moment, Pre-sold, Pre-packaged to a ready made audience desperate to spend their money, it is just another fashionable element in today's throw away age. Telephones i believe are sold this way, at least this is how i see the commercial world of now. Now, i know my views are in total opposition to the frankly ridiculous high score's on this web site, and please don't think i am not grateful, my local multiplex needs big profit films to survive and hopefully prosper so the likes of me can see proper films that are real cinematic experiences but make next to no money, usually that's the fate of most superior films these day's! 
Can i be positive in any way about this Marvel, well i saw it in 4DX & 3D, the chair swam and jolted, there were lights, flashes, and sprays or did i imagine the last one, oh yes, the sound was loud, very very loud. and Oh yes do not forget, it is extremely long, very very long, like a bad flight across the Atlantic but without the benefits of a helpful service attendant's tray. Did i enjoy it? in any way, well no, just too much of a good thing, i like sugar in my tea, but 32 spoons is to much! This i will call it for ease, a film, it just had too much of everything. Now, i can just imagine steam boiling over from most readers that i am clearly to old and out of touch, but i argue not so, the trailer for Deadpool 2 was so funny and inventive that i am eagerly awaiting this release. As for all these many many super hero's to numerous to remember and to numerous to mention, i do have a question for superhero's obviously adoring public the question is, are the comic books any better?","

"Avengers: Infinity War","brianjohnson-20043","8 May 2018","I like the stand alone Marvel Movies more, but it almost feels like an obligation to see all of them if you want to see the ones you like, or else, you'll have no idea what's going on when the ones you like continue. I'm prefacing with that so readers understand that I'm not just a hater.First off, I want to address the villain. My opinions I've heard/read asserted Thanos is a strength to this film. I found that to be the opposite. I found his motivation more convincing than the Justice League villains, who were so bad, I can't even really remember their motivation, and a bit less stupid than Ultron who was the AI thing that might have seemed like a real issue in the 80s or early 90s. But today it seems clear that the misuse of technology to our demise is going to be gradual rather than sudden. The vulture from Spider Man Homecoming, or the villain from Black Panther were much more compelling In my Opinion. Thanos felt like a cartoonish version of the villain Samuel Jackson played in the first Kingsmen movie. Except that Thanos didn't work like how the similar villain in Kingsmen worked. They're both trying to save everything by killing off a sizable chunk of people before people kill their planet or planets. The difference is that Thanos wants to randomly and painlessly kill half of everyone everywhere, and Valentine wants to save a few chosen wealthy friends. Overpopulation and idiocy is a real issue on earth. But in the Marvel Universe, it's a planet to planet issue, and it seems stupid to just kill off half of everyone on some planets which might not have any actual problems. And this issue is never even questioned by any of the characters. They just try to play the card that Thanos should try to save people, not kill them. Not a bad point. But it didn't seem like any of the Avengers seemed even remotely interesting in addressing Thanos' concerns. Not even Gamora. Plus, if someone gets two or three of these infinity stones, let alone all of them, can't they use that person yield that power to do good rather than evil? It just didn't settle very well with me. Loki was a much better villain because he's like the Joker. Destruction and chaos is his high. That's a real thing in people that an audience should be able to understand.The strength of this movie is the humor. I laughed repeatedly and was certainly entertained in that regard. It also, no surprise, looked really good and had great music. I was surprised how well the Guardians characters fit in with the other Marvel characters. But to me a feature length movie, even a short one, can't be good if the story isn't compelling. And this movie is long. If the villain's story was halfway decent it would have stood a good shot, but just getting characters together that one likes and making a spectacle, won't make up for giant flaws in the story. I didn't expect everything to be concluded, because these movie all set up more to come. But with an ending like this film has, it should have been advertised as the 1st part of 2 movies from the start. I really don't get how the next Ant-Man movie is going to work after what happened here in Inifinity Wars. Unless it takes place prior to the events of Infinity Wars, I don't see it working. But if that's the case, why not have Ant Man 2 come out first? I'm not a comic book reader. I open them up, look at the picture and think:""I'm supposed to take these silly-looking overdramatic characters and pictures seriously? Do other people see how goofy these images are? What am I, 10? But I've heard from friends who like the comics that much of the events of this film unfolded as they did to stay loyal to the events in the comics. My response to this is that every form of entertainment's first goal should be to work within its own form. To me Infinity Wars' narrative doesn't work for a feature movie. I was upset with how it ended. And I know I wasn't the only one in the theater upset. And I find it disgraceful that, at the moment, this movie has 8.9 stars out of 10. Black Panther doesn't have 8 and it's actually good. What's wrong with people? This movie is currently ranked ahead of movies like 12 Angry Men, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, It's a Wonder life, American History X, The Prestige or Every Single Pixar Movie. What is wrong with people?","

"Avengers: Infinity War","hawkins_saints_rock","25 April 2018","Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable. The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them. My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it. Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves. 9.8/10","

"Avengers: Infinity War","eden-rabatsch","25 April 2018","Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","nodlimax","28 April 2018","This movie has various problems and the first major one is the lack of focus. We keep jumping around to various places and I can't even keep where all of them were.One moment, we are on earth, the next on Knowhere, the next on some other planet to which I can't even remember the name. And it's not just the places, it's the characters too. There isn't one lead or even 5 lead characters we can somewhat focus on. They try to focus on everybody which means nobody is the actual lead character. There was another movie that was initially praised but in the end was heavily critizised for lacking focus on a real main character - that was Star Wars The Phantom Menace. I see the same problem in this regard here with the story.Due to the lack of focus the movie also has pacing issues and therefore to me felt boring. And then this goes on for 150 minutes. And the biggest problem at the end of the movie is that there is no payoff.......ok stop, I have to correct myself there. The payoff (here comes the spoiler) is, that the bad guy wins. Everything the heroes tried to do failed and you know what I was actually kinda rooting for Thanos, because I couldn't care enough about any of the other characters. He became the protagonist for me, which makes me feel terrible as well, because he kills half the population in the universe.In the end I was just happy that the movie was over. However the writers put themselfes in a corner. Thanos is pretty much god at this point and objectively speaking there is no way anyone could defeat him at this point except if they go for something like ""his glove lost the power after he used it"" which is cheap. That will then result in the heroes trying to get back the time stone and then turning back time or something similar stupid.I will not see the next one in cinema. At this point I am pretty much done with superhero movies. I guess I can thank Disney now for first pushing me away from Star Wars and now Marvel.The effects and sound were decent though.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","deastman_uk","28 April 2018","How long has it been since the Dark Knight? The DC film that defined how an epic comic book fantasy could wrap a world around a hero and a villain.Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.","

The action and special effects are very well done, the pacing, powers and 'decisions' are on par with a B-horror movie. When having the ability to end a scene quickly or leave a scene quickly, our 'heroes' would stand there and trade one-liners. I seriously considered walking out at the lack of competence.

"Avengers: Infinity War","Lursa","6 May 2018","SPOILER ALERT!!
I am a Marvel Chick. I totally dig the whole Marvel Verse and wave my 'fangirl flag' proudly. I was looking forward to this movie so much...then something happened. I went to see it today. I did not read any of the reviews before I went. I never do. I always view a film without input from folk that usually don't know what I like. So there I was, popcorn and coke in hand. Two rows back from the screen ('cause I'm into total immersion, okay) in my reclining seat. Ten minutes in and I know we're in trouble. It's not the fact that two of my favorite characters didn't survive the opening credits. This is Infinity War, right? People are gonna die. It's just seemed so pointless. Loki dies but Thor survives? How is that fair? Hemdall dies saving Hulk of all people?? Not that I'm hatin' on Hulk...but come on, Hemdall! You have sworn an oath to the 'Thone of Asgard' and you don't save EITHER of the princes? Really?? I know Hulk is refusing to 'come out' after Thanos kicks his butt that no one ever has before but still...The movie goes rapidly downhill from here. Thanos and his twisted cult of psychopaths got on my nerves early and they danced all over them until the end of the film. We bounce all over the world (and off it) to keep Thanos away from the Infinity stones. Who decided that two of the most important stones be 'hidden' on earth? Not a good idea. Our Merry Band of Marvel Heroes needs to take a page out of the Star Trek verse. 'The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few or the one.' This could have saved SO many lives. Loki gives Thanos the Tesseract to save Thor. Thanos tried to kill them all anyway. Actually succeeds in killing both Loki, Hemdall and all of the Asgardians. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, the daughter he loves. (Thanos has a really weird idea of what love entails...but whatever) He does this so he can gain access to the Soul Stone. Dr. Strange gives Thanos the Time Stone to save Tony Stark. (Tony Stark? Wasn't his expiration date up like a couple years ago?? ) This gives Thanos the power to turn back time whenever he wants. Which he does after Scarlett Witch kills Vision (her lover) to destroy the Mind Stone. He just turns back time. Rips the stone out of Vision's head and heads off to wipe out life as we know it. So Scarlett Witch went through all that gut wrenching heartache for nothing.This could have been a good movie. Maybe even a great one but it's not. It's a mishmash of the worst parts of just about every Marvel movie over the past 10 years. There are a few notable omissions. Most of the gang is on deck but they're so ineffective. They rehash the same differences they had in their other movies showing little or no growth or development aside from the superficial 'romantic' themes. I get that Pepper and Tony are an item. We knew this already. I get that Black Widow and Bruce are an item. We knew this two movies ago. Same with Gamora and Peter, Scarlett Witch and Vision. and on and on and on. This is supposed to make their loss more poignant but it doesn't. The fight sequence in Wakanda and on Thanos home planet were so predictable. Such a waste of excellent CGI and actors.The only surprise in the movie is who survives. Thor, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers survive. I know this is to set up the next part of the Infinity War set that is scheduled to hit theaters later this year. The Russo boys need to step up their game. This disappointment does not bode well for the new film. Guys. sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Just FYI. You just know that someone is going to get hold of the time stone and turn back time so we can blah, blah, blah. Been there, done that. I really wanted to love this movie. I really, really did. But I left the theater feeling used and not in a good way. I felt like Marvel turned up the manipulation meter to eleven. Because, you know it's eleven which is one more than ten, right?I rated the movie a '4' because I wanted it to be good. It just wasn't.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","gcarpiceci","2 May 2018","Sometimes when you cook a dish for your guests, you think that you'll make it more tasteful if you keep adding ingredients over ingredients; so, you have made this nice pizza, you have put your tomato sauce, your mozzarella cheese, maybe some ham, then you think why not some mushrooms, and well peppers will be just perfect on top it, and don't forget olives and cappers, hey we have some sausage in the fridge just slam it on top of it....etc. Most likely your guests will spend the night wrestling with your heavy-loaded pizza, trying to digest it.
Well, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars.
Note that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc...

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheSeaLion","1 May 2018","While all of the heroes from across the Marvel cinematic universe united in a joint effort to stop Thanos, so too did all of the problems you can think of unite in a joint effort to bring down ""Infinity War.""It should be noted that I am not the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the most part, I find the movies to be passable while there are a few I have really liked, such as ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and some I have despised, such as ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers."" ""Infinity War"" could have fallen anywhere on the spectrum for me, and unfortunately, it fell at the way-down low side as the second worst movie in the entire franchise.The opening scene of the movie is the perfect setup for what is wrong with ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attacking an Asgardian ship with all of the main characters from ""Thor: Ragnarok"" on it. Thanos has killed everyone aboard, except for the few characters necessary to help keep the plot moving. Heimdall (Idris Elba) is left wounded so that he can be killed off by Thanos on screen after using his powers to send Hulk (Bruce Banner) to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers. It is supposed to be an emotional death scene, but the laziness of the writing and the showcasing of character stupidity for the purpose of plot progression is all too evident. Why didn't Thanos just kill Heimdall during the attack on the ship like he did with everyone else on board? It's simple: the plot would not be able to continue if he had done that.Character stupidity is at an all time high in ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" and it is not just restricted to Thanos. There is a lack of communication between characters for no reason other than for the movie to happen, and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) goes so far as to screw everything up in what is easily the worst written scene in the entire movie.The stupidity of the characters can all be attributed to an awfully written script. So much of the dialogue in the movie is the Marvel quips, but a lot of it comes in the form of characters throwing personal jabs at one another to the point of wondering why these heroes can't set aside their differences and not be annoying for even five minutes in order to stop a villain who wants to wipe out half of the universe's population.Yep, that's right. Thanos' goal is to wipe out half of the population of the entire universe. One complaint that people have had with Marvel is how safe their characters all feel. So, Thanos killing off half the population would seem like it was putting their characters in danger, right? Wrong. All of the characters who are killed by Thanos are the characters who had already overstayed their welcome in the franchise or do not feel permanent because, let's be honest, they are needed for future installments to the Marvel universe. It is ironic that the movie that seemingly takes the most risks is the movie that played things the safest.Even if these deaths did feel like a risk, it would not really matter. With so many characters to focus on, the movie has almost no time for character arcs (which is fine) and instead must show its characters through their speech and actions. However, so many of these characters act so annoying or stupid that you are just wishing for them to be killed off, and then the characters who are killed at the end by Thanos destroying half the population lacks any emotional weight because after nearly three hours of unbearable characters and dialogue, it is just a relief that the movie is almost over.The two things that ""Infinity War"" did well was not making the story feel jumbled and clustered with all of the characters, and they did do a good job with the characters of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany), but that is it. When it comes to everything else, the movie falls prey to a term film critic Roger Ebert used, which is 'idiot plot.'Idiot plot means that the only way for the plot to happen is for the characters to act like idiots, which I already went into a little bit to explain how even the smartest of characters have to act like morons in this movie for the plot to progress, but the entire plot of the movie is an idiot plot as well. Thanos' plan to wipe out half of the population only makes sense to the point of his backstory. In execution, it is a plan that falls apart and becomes dumber the more you think about it. This might be, though, because the movie tries to paint Thanos and his plan off as having depth to it, but this sort of plan would only make sense and work for a generic super hero villain who just wants to destroy the world because he is evil. So, with a villain with faux-depth and an evil plan that would only work for a generic super villain character, the overall plot of the movie is a dumb villain scheme that has awful juxtaposition to it.""Infinity War,"" to put it simply, is just awful. Nothing more, nothing less. And for a movie this big that had a decade of hype and buildup and planning, that is just sad.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","imaxxing","3 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. 
That being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. 
Infinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.
 
So, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.Great CGI.No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.Too many characters.The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. 
For the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.It bordered on a comedy.For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. 
While some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.Geared towards a younger audience. As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents. It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. 
Most of us have outgrown the cliches. Poor ending.Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling. A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film.Overall 6.4/10","

"Avengers: Infinity War","AGood","4 May 2018","This film was literally 2 and a half hours of non stop roller coaster action. This may sound like the perfect movie. But just think of this for a moment.The film was literally;Villian comes on the scene, whichever avengers is around flies or runs at them. Gets bounced back. Flies again, gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back.Then an escape happens, as the villian always gets what he come for as even his minions are way too powerful for every single avenger in the film. Cue literally 2mins of wisecracking and jokes. Next scene cuts eslewhere, villian comes on the scene, avenger flies or runs at them, gets bounced back, then 2 more mins of wisecracking and jokes..... for 2 and a half hours.The diaglogue is minimal in the extreme. Possibly only 200 or so words get said in total throughout the whole 2 and a half hour movie. Almost all of it is just filler wisecracking jokes.Watching this movie honestly felt like watching someone else play a video game, with the 2min cut scenes kept in.I don't know if I am getting old, or if it was just this film but I did not enjoy this. I loved black panther that I seen a month ago. But also hated Justice Leage so am not sure. I get the feeling kids will love this and think it the most epic thing they have ever seen.

"Avengers: Infinity War","mitrapourmand","14 May 2018","We all know that these movies are blockbusters , we know that we should not expect much , when someone sits through one of these he /she should not expect citizen Kane , or the seventh seal , these movies are almost always mindless action scenes and big bangs and boom ( throw in a few punch line and some lame one liners and voila you have have your self an action movie ) but , at the same time these movies must be compared with other movies of the same genre , even the same universe to see pros and cons and for this i like to review it based on two of my favorite MCU movies. Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings .","

"Avengers: Infinity War","dcortner-19918","10 January 2024","The best Marvel movie to date IMO. Fantastic all-around. The pacing was spot on, and I was very concerned about it going in. I thought I'd be feeling bored or dragging around the 2hr mark. But when Thanos reached Wakanda, I knew things were ending soon and I actually remember thinking I didn't want it to end.The cast were all stellar in their roles. Love Cap's new look. Really enjoyed seeing RDJ back on-screen as Iron Man as well. Tom Holland really surprised me with how emotional that Spider-Man death scene was. The ""I don't want to go"" got to me.I thought we'd get some exposition or the Avengers reuniting in some capacity first, but I'm glad we opened with a Thanos attack. It helped establish the pace and set the tone. The movie kept that tone throughout. Thanos is a badass, but I also really enjoyed seeing his backstory and character. In his own twisted way, he definitely did care for Garmora. The relief on his face at the end was a really strong moment. He completed his goal, in his eyes he's done the universe a great justice and now he can just relax.I do hope that at least Loki & Gamora stay dead. I understand those that vanished are going to come back but I think bringing those 2 back would be a bit extreme.I thought for sure Tony Stark or Steve Rodgers were going to bite the bullet in this one. But it just makes me that much more intrigued to see where things go from here.Also, I have to shoutout the score. The music in this film was incredible. I'm not familiar with Alan Silvestri but he did an amazing job. The score enhanced every single scene, and helped immerse me into this world. Fantastic work.","

OK, Thanos is all powerful, but he beats Hulk with a few punches and knees. At least make the fight big.The writing got worse when the Guardians of the SJW Galaxy took the screen - cardboard characters wisecracking their way through vacant scenes.In fact, that's most of the movie. Most of the men act like 12 year old boys, arguing at the drop of a hat. That's supposed to be Stark's gimmick, but most of the heroes (males) act that way. There's no difference between Stark, Peter Parker or even Dr. Strange or even his Buddhist buddy.Most of the dialogue is banter. Mostly the so called actors pose their way through scenes. The fight scenes are so CGI and camera movement heavy that it's impossible to tell what's happening.The movie made a lot of money - a lot of people love the Emperor's new suit.","

I am happy that it feels like and is a Thanos movie, a movie about a giant purple men who is here not because to kill smth but to fullfil his deep inner beliefs which is well written and understandable for the audience.
The level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.This movie is not perfect. Jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and Peter Quills occurence with Thanos at Titan is not well thought out. I wish there would be a better solution.Still. 10 years developement of a consistent franchise. And in the end a purple men with a not so empty heart wins. ITS GREAT.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","SnoopyStyle","11 May 2018","The Avengers face their most powerful opponent yet in Thanos. Thanos is collecting the six Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet to execute his evil plan. The heroes of the MCU struggle to stop him.It is amazing that this works as well as it does. This could be best described as The Empire Strikes Back portion of the MCU so far. The heroes get their butts kicked from one end of the universe to the other. It ends with a mass disintegration which is honestly even sadder and much darker than TESB. TESB ends bittersweet but this is just dark. Although anybody with a brain would see that the snap will be reversed in some way. There are many deaths that cannot happen which does diminishes the shock value of the ending. They can't kill off Spider-Man because the MCU doesn't even own him. Sony would never let it happen. They also can't kill off Black Panther due to his future movie and more importantly, his new popularity. Obviously, some characters will not make it but I think the vast majority will rise from the dead. The constant death reversals in the MCU saps away the shock value and that's probably this movie's main drawback. If they picked different characters to disintegrate, I might have doubts about reversing it.The advantage of the MCU is that these characters are so familiar that none of them needs introduction. In fact, this one starts from the end of Thor: Ragnarok and is no worst off by it. The relationships are well established. It's great fun to have them run into other heroes they've never met. Thor joining the Guardians generates a whole lot of hilarity. Drax is especially funny. Quill's insecurities is fun. There is an interesting pairing of Stark and Dr. Strange with Spider-Man as a fun sidekick. Relationships continue to be the strength of this franchise. The heroes are so well defined that the movie can spend its time with the villain. One of this franchise's weakness has always been the lackluster villains but Thanos is allowed to have his character development. His view points and his love for his daughter Gamora give him real depth. In many ways, this is Thanos' movie and it is more compelling due to the development.I do have some other minor issues. The giant Dinklage may be oddly cute at first but it's just odd. That section doesn't have the same action as Wakanda. Thor holding open the iris is not much of an action scene. I'd rather have that section finish quicker without flipping back and forth there. I would push that section back into the middle. The plan for Vision's stone seems like a low percentage play and his reasoning for sacrificing himself seems much more poetic. There has to be a way to do a ""needs of the many"" scene earlier and end in the same place anyways. Overall, this is well-constructed, well-conceived, and well-made. Despite the darkness, it still has its fun. The plot never stalls. The villains are great. The heroes are never in doubt. The franchise continues to be in good hands.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","phoenixinvictus","6 August 2018","I can almost guess how the sequel is going to go... they are going to use some ridiculous time travel trick to undo all of Thanos damage. This two and a half hour movie was nothing more than a ten minute cameo for each actor to fight some alien.
The HUGE plot hole in this movie is Thanos ""plan"" and Ant-Man's mysterious absence in this movie. Let's see how absurd the plot hole of this movie is... Thanos' master plan is to wipe out half the population of the Universe because according to him there aren't enough resources for us all. Have you seen the size of the Universe??? The resources are almost endless! The Universe is a BIG place people! How can anyone not point that out to him? With his magic gauntlet complete he can just ""magic"" all the resources he wants with the snap of his fingers. Duh! But that is not all... Ant-Man possesses the technology to END WORLD HUNGER!!! All he needs to do is supersize ""a steak"" to the size of a ""truck"" and presto you can feed an entire city for weeks. Right there is the weapon to end Thanos' dumb logic.
Almost right in the beginning of the movie Thanos kills off the Asgardians on the ship, except for the main characters because... well just because we'll dump logic out of window and not bother the audience. Thanos then kills Loki-for REAL this time. Let me please have a moment to laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA! Even if Loki is really dead this time I cannot feel anything but amusement at this ridiculous death for he has died so many times that I have lost count! Why should I feel sorry for a guy who wanted humans to worship him as a living god? Wasn't this the guy who literally placed his father in an old folks home to rot away? Wasn't he the one responsible for starting a war of genocide? Wasn't he the one who was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people and caused the near destruction of New York City? Wasn't he the one who caused the invasion of New York City by aliens?
Let's face facts! Nearly every Marvel character has died and been brought back to life that it actually is getting boring!
Heimdall who is wounded uses the last of his powers to transport Hulk\Bruce Banner to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers instead of-I don't know- beaming the tesseract away from Thanos. How about sending it to the edge of the Universe? It's not like he has a locating beacon to find these things.
Gamora wants to stay away from Thanos because she knows something that he wants and makes Star Lord promise her he will kill her (yeah right). Gamora then does the very thing she said she wouldn't do and runs directly to Thanos to engages him in battle where we all know that she will lose.
Aliens attack New York again. What an unlucky city. Doctor Strange is abducted and Wong doesn't seem to care that his friend is in danger and returns home... Really Wong, I'm so disappointed with you! Why doesn't he open up a portal to rescue his BFF? I know that Doctor Strange wouldn't have abandoned him... of course there is the fact that Wong's ten minutes were up and the studio couldn't afford him. Okay Wong I forgive you. Doctor Strange doesn't use his magic gem to turn back time and ""bargain"" with Thanos. Why doesn't he do it? With the help of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spiderman and Star Lord they hatch up a ""plan"" to remove the magic gauntlet off Thanos rather than just cut off the guy's arm off! Star Lord being the screw up that he is screws up the entire plan. Doctor Strange simply gives up the time gem because it's the only way to prolong this agonizing movie for another hour! Why didn't I just stop watching this movie?
Captain America who is a fugitive is suddenly pardoned because he is just so darn good looking and awesome in his costume. Vision says that he won't trade a life for a life but there were so many lives lost during the battle to remove the stone from his head. Wakanda is invaded and the Hulk refuses to come out of the closet... So why was he saved and not someone else? Does anyone care? Why didn't Wong and his friends appear in the final battle and lock the evil alien army into the ""mirror dimension""? I'm just saying... Everyone dies and we all know that they aren't going to stay that way. These movies get worse and worse each year.","

It just keeps coming at you relentlessly. At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before.

"Avengers: Infinity War","antialias11","13 May 2018","*** Warning, mild spoilers ahead *** Ok, what sticks out about this movie? Nothing much. 
The acting is lackluster. No character has a character arc - understandable because none of them are given any significant screen time. The whole movie is basically one endless 3-hour brawl (with some battle scenes blatantly ripped from Star Wars/Lord of the Rings). Some of the brawls are so over-the top that they are ludicrous (even by comicbook standards). Example: When you break a moon into pieces and hurl all of them at someone on the planet below within one second then the impacting pieces should not just make a puff of dust when they land. The motivation of the villain makes no sense (after achieving his goal the universe will just be back to the earlier situation soon enough). Given that it's hard to emote with a villain in the first place having a full CGI villain makes it even less likely. Some of Gamoras mood swings in the matter where we're supposed to emote with him or her make even less sense.Speaking of CGI: It's on a level we've come to expect with some weird exceptions. E.g. in one instance we see Bruce Banner's head in the open cockpit of the Hulkbuster armor while he's standing around in the background - and it looks like someone just copied it in with MS-Paint. Seriously. Not even Photoshop quality but MS-Paint.The humor is relegated to one-liners and most don't land. The serious one-liners are predictable and pithy. 
The music score is effective if somewhat over-the-top pathos-heavy (but that's not unusual for US films, so it' one of those things we've come to expect to have to endure)The overwhelming feeling is that this movie was ""designed by comittee"". The boardroom idea seems to have been: ""Take the things that people enjoyed in other movies and make them non-stop"". 
Problem is: It doesn't work that way. Gems in movies are that because they are rare. Taking the time to lead up to them makes the payoff all that sweeter.After coming back I rewatched the first Avengers movie just to see if my memory deceived me. But no: It is a way, way, WAY superior film in every respect.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Jared_Andrews","5 May 2018","Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection. There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges. Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all. I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts. Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does.The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve.So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea. For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless.Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected. The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians. The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. 
Spiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony ""Mr. Stark"" and Tony calls Peter ""kid."" There's a certain father-son/mentor-protégé sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever.Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music.Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints.1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him ""Vizz"" is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention.
2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it.
3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie.Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did. Join the phenomenon and see Infinity War today. If you love superheroes, you will probably love this movie.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","gavinp9","25 April 2018","SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much. The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista). The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Leofwine_draca","29 December 2019","So, here we have it: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the Marvel climax to a string of approximately twenty prior movies and considered by many to be the crowning achievement of the genre thus far. And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","MxS7HGS","28 January 2024","Infinity War is a favorite among superhero fans. It tells the story of how the Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, confront Thanos, an Eternal, who is determined to gather all six infinity stones and wipe out half of the universe's population. The fate of the universe rests on their shoulders.It begins with a high stakes opening sequence on a ship, where Thanos and his children are introduced with well-written dialogue and a powerful score by Alan Silvestri. The Hulk's confrontation with Thanos showcases the sheer might of the Eternal, establishing him as a formidable adversary for the Avengers.Despite a large cast of characters, it balances them well without feeling overstuffed. It tells a compelling story in two and a half hours, maintaining consistently fast pacing. It features notable performances from actors like Josh Brolin, who plays Thanos with great intensity and Robert Downey Jr., who delivers some of the best-acted emotion in the entire MCU, adding depth to his character.However, some parts of the movie are criticized for feeling contrived or lacking in visual appeal. For example, the moment when Starlord punches Thanos feels forced, and the CGI and aging effects on certain suits are questionable.Despite these flaws, Infinity War is a monumental achievement in the MCU's early phases and stands as a convincing assertion that these films are indeed a form of cinema.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","realmuthaf","6 May 2018","Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good.The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway.There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone ""for balance"" with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah.Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around.I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable. This, however, just continues the downward trend of movies like Guardians 2 and Thor 3.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Shadowboy_25cm","23 November 2021","""Avengers: Infinity War"" culminates the 10 years build-up of the MCU to this first part finale:The villain is very powerful, complex and interesting to watch, although his final art design is not that impressive as other impressive versions of Thanos.There is a lot of super-hero drama, a lot of apocalyptic atmosphere, a lot of smart subplots and impressive locations, there is a lot of surprise.The movie is very watchable and constructed somehow around best-of-scenes, very fast-paced, jumping from one important fight and conflict to another leaving behind some logic. The action and the SFX are impressive, I as a viewer have nearly none time to chill out,
it's a tour de force till the final battle. Very courageous by the makers to finish this movie as a Part 1-movie of a 2-part-finale (just like the new ""Dune"" movie by Denis Villeneuve in 2021).It's a good MCU movie (it's better than the second part ""Avengers: Endgame"") that relies on the former MCU movies to keep it as a fast-paced, gripping story till the end.Highly recommended.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","maruugaa","18 May 2018","I'm not a fan of Marvel or DC or basically anything that Disney creates. Unfortunately, my friend wanted to see it and I figured:
1) There's a chance it could be good, considering there were other movies I thought were going to be bad, such as(Blockers, The Purge, Keanu, and even Wonder Woman) that turned out to be good, so I shouldn't pass this off right away just because it's Disney
2) I figured it couldn't be worse than Red Sparrow.Anyway, I was wrong to both of those. This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence.The only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade.The entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life.With the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class. Also, as someone who was forced to go to Catholic Church as a kid, if you've ever gone to the Good Friday or Palm Sunday mass where they all read that dialogue in monotonous voices that's so insufferable you're in pain? That's how I felt in this movie. I would've rather been a child at Good Friday mass again, because at least then there was prospect of a Cream Egg for sitting through that drawl.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","PedanticEditor","2 June 2018","This movie is shockingly bad, especially compared with the other avengers films, and is the absolute worst Marvel movie ever made. Almost as bad as the Batman vs. Superman movie was for the DC universe. Fair warning, this review is all spoilers - not that it really matters since you shouldn't see the film anyway.I saw the film today and I can't help but conclude that the writers of this film were just lazy. For shame! I get that Infinity War is supposed to be the first part of a two-parter, so pretty much all the good guys had to die. But there are ways of making good guys lose without having them act like lobotomy patients throughout the whole story and literally die from stupidity every step of the way (oh, except for Spiderman who is inexplicably the only intelligent character in the story). In what ways were the good guys unbelievably dumb every step of the way, you ask? I'll tell you. And then I'll tell you what some better written alternatives could have been. This is just from memory, so there are probably more instances of bad writing that I've forgotten.1. Loki gives up a stone to save Thor, even though it may be possible to resurrect him later and Loki knows half the universe will die as an eventual result.2. Loki goes after the more-powerful-than-gods Thanos a moment later with a knife. An effing knife!3. The first thing Dr. Strange does is as Ironman for help. Whaa?4. Dr. Strange gets tangled up in weeds and faints, then to be carried off like a swooned and helpless fairytale maiden.5. Gamora attacks Thanos first, by herself, even though she knows she alone holds the key to a stone.6. Gamora gives up the final stone to relieve her sister from momentary torture, knowing that half of all life in the universe will die as a result.7. Wakanda opens its forcefield, and the super-duper powerful lady stops guarding the last stone in order to fight.8. Star Lord prevents the other good guys from removing the infinity stone holder from Thanos by deliberately saving Thanos from the mind control lady.9. Ironman didn't punch Star Lord's lights out when he saw that he was getting ready to do something moronic.10. Neither did Dr. Strange.11. Thor stabs the Thanos through the chest with a super-axe (which was obviously stupid in the first place, but even then he has time to pull it back out and chop off the baddy's head), and instead the baddy says ""You should have gone for the head"" and sucks himself into a portal to escape.12. Last, and least important but still annoying, the Hulk is effectively impotent for no good reason.Here are 3 Possible solutions off the top of my head that would have been less poorly written:1. Dr. Strange is distracted by something even more important for the entire movie, so that the other heroes can die tragically, and in the second movie he stops being too busy and just rolls back time and undoes Thanos' acquisition of the stones - also causing the heroes to not die.2. Same thing, except Dr. Strange or his compatriot could have opened up and closed one of their portal thingies to snip off Thanos' arm with the stones on it.3. Thor could have died trying to make the super-axe, or he could have cut off Thanos' head and someone else evil could quickly put on the stone-holding glove thing instead. Either way would have been an improvement.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","rowpotdroid","29 April 2018","Suffering hype fatigue, over a year of industry talk about this movie in pre release. It takes away from viewing the movie. In the end it's just more of the same computer generated over the top smash and bash that appeals to 12 year olds or those that are stuck at that age. The first avengers was original. But now what Hollywood movie makers due best, take an original movie concept to cash in until death in franchising occurs. Sorry about raining on your Hollywood comic book Heroes block borer. But the only hero I can see is someone to say enough comic book sequels. They've become boring and predictable recycles. I spent more time thinking about how uncomfortable the theater seat was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie. Seems Hollywood is addicted to CGI for making movies that shouldn't be made. If they keep going this way they could probably try selling a film of things just blowing up, no story, plot or actors acting just things blowing up.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","bob the moo","27 August 2018","I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.","

The Russo brothers do a crazy good job with managing this huge cast. Every character is given some sort of purpose and their time to shine and it makes for through the roof entertainment but also a well written movie.This film has a really big advantage over other MCU films, all of the characters except for one have been developed. It allows the movie to focus far more on the plot and making a quality story and less so on showing who these characters are. This movie is very fast paced, which creates what is the most entertaining MCU film.The one character that was developed was Thanos played by Josh Brolin. He is the best MCU villain because he was developed. Almost all of the MCU films have one issue and that is the villain. Most MCU villains are not given enough development to be considered a good villain. Thanos is the polar opposite. This film does an amazing job of explaining his character and explaining his motive. There are a few times where you actually ponder whether he is right and that shows how well written Thanos is.The action in this film is insanely well managed. You get to see each character have their action moment and makes for a really entertaining watch. The comedy was also very good and I feel they managed it a lot better than other MCU instalments. I find a lot of MCU projects use comedy at inappropriate times whereas this film did not.In terms of gripes there were a lot of plot holes, which is hard to fault them on because of how much they already have to deal with but plot holes are there and they need to be mentioned.Overall this film is amazing.

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheNabOwnzz","2 August 2018","Since i am not a little boy that has an absurd kind of fondness for Marvel comics & thus its movies, i am able to judge them objectively without being prejudiced by a couple of adults flying around in capes. And with this knowledge, it is quite obvious that Infinity War is indeed objectively a terrible movie.As stated before i am admittedly not a Marvel fan, and i did not care to watch any of its predecessors before this one. It ofcourse should never be a requirement to watch about 18 films in order to comprehend this one better, but to be honest you really don't miss anything during Infinity War's simplistic narrative if you have missed all its previous films, except for maybe knowing the characters in it. But judging from what i have seen none of them are even slightly relatable even when having watched previous films. So even if you have watched previous films, a connection with these characters is impossible since they are so terrible written and often times poorly acted.First off, i cannot fathom enough how terrible the screenplay is. A couple of characters try to be funny and come up with lines of dialogue a 8 year old could have though of, such as: 'Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards' or 'Why is Gamora', or the discussion about Thor's new haircut. The plain stupidity in its dialogue and writing is basically an insult to the audience's intelligence, and thus it is a very dumb and low IQ motion picture due to this. The acting is mostly terrible, except by perhaps Josh Brolin ( Which is saying a lot, since he was a pure CGI character ). Especially Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt & Tom Holland all hand in absolutely atrocious and horrendous performances. All of them try to be funny and joke around in serious times, but it is never funny, instead its terrible pretentious attempt at creating wisecracks results in loads of cringeworthy scenes that will make the audience embarrassed to witness. Although in the three actors's defence, the abysmal script didn't help their performances either, and they are only partly to blame.The only interesting character in the film is Thanos, and while it does help a little bit that he has the most screen time of all characters by far, he still seems to be a victim of the cliché fest that is Infinity War since his reasons for wanting to take over the world are hardly original ( Sacrifice the few to save the many kind of motivations, which we have all seen before ), and can probably be found in the 'Standard Hollywood villain rules guide book' anywhere. None of the 'Good guys' are relatable because their dialogue is so ridiculous and since the only intelligent person in the film seems to be Thanos, as everybody else seems to be lacking in self awareness and self consciousness on every level ( Especially all the times people who know what Thanos is capable of keep attacking him like they think they have a chance, what a joke that is ).There is once again a lot of sub par plastic cinematography with many artificial backdrops, especially in Wakanda. None of it seems particularly natural, and thus the film also has this visually artificial kind of feel that further decreases your immersion ( Although the characters already decreased this pretty far down with their terrible dialogue ). There is no depth or real sub text in the film except perhaps Thanos showing little Gomora his knife balancing which symbolizes his view of a world in balance, but that is pretty much all the cleverness in it. It also has a lot of melodramatic scenes ( Especially with Vision and that redhead woman whose name i forget ) between characters that you cannot relate with, and the only thing that i wanted to see happen was Thanos killing them all, as he was the only individual with even a slightly bit of depth or character, thus making only him, the villain, relatable. Ofcourse as is standard in modern films Infinity War is also very politically correct in that it uses a lot of women warriors fighting like men against eachother in order to negate gender differences like there are none, which further enhances the notion that this is ultimately an irrelevant film.Admittedly the only strength this film might have comes from Thanos's character, and everything else seems irrelevant due to terrible acting & writing. In the end, despite that a lot of characters meet their demise, it still feels as though nothing is really at stake because all the characters are frequently making unfunny jokes & dumb decisions, which in turn leads to the question: 'Why should we care?'","

The ending kinda saved it for me to be a 7/10, ending was good and that is why i'm giving this movie 8/10. But i do not believe that it will end eventually the way it ended in this movie, common - there a more bucks needs to made from this universe. That said, i do not understand what is this movie making on the IMDB 250 list (currently at 30th position) - its definitely not that great. You can trow a rock at me if this movie is better then ""Terminator 2"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" - this only shows how many fans this movie and franchise has - not the quality of this product itself.Overall, ""Infinity War"" was a good 2 h 20 min escapism, but it suffers pacing issues here and there. At the end i liked this picture and will check the 2nd part as well.","

People praise The Russo Brothers for this film, even going as far as to say that this film is the ""best superhero movie ever."" That is not true and if you're too blind to see that this movie was worse than Age of Ultron, which comparably was pretty bad itself, but this takes the cake and you shouldn't watch, or rate, superhero movies. Don't for a moment think that Avengers: Endgame will be any better. When you write a film so full of plot holes that it may as well have been filmed through a cheese grater, you should not be praised as great directors, or even called writers at that point either. You should be bent over the knee and spanked and then scolded for writing, and directing such a bad movie.I've never uttered these words before but Ang Li's Hulk with Eric Banna was better than this film.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","PedroReviews","30 January 2024","Avengers: Infinity War, the culmination of Marvel Studios' decade-long superhero saga, stands as a cinematic masterpiece that defies expectations and delivers an exhilarating and emotionally resonant experience. The film masterfully weaves together a multitude of storylines, bringing together an ensemble of beloved Marvel heroes to confront their most formidable foe yet: Thanos, the ruthless cosmic warlord seeking to restore balance to the universe by wiping out half of all living beings.At the heart of Avengers: Infinity War lies a complex and compelling narrative that explores themes of power, sacrifice, and the delicate balance of fate. The film challenges conventional superhero tropes, questioning the very nature of heroism and the cost of saving the world. Thanos, portrayed with chilling intensity by Josh Brolin, emerges as a formidable villain driven by a twisted sense of righteousness, adding a layer of moral ambiguity to the story.The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing the impressive power and skill of each Avenger. From the intense clash between the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos's Black Order on the planet Titan to the epic showdown in Wakanda, the film delivers a visually stunning and visceral spectacle that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, Avengers: Infinity War excels in its character development, giving each Avenger ample screen time to shine. We witness the growth and evolution of beloved characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America, while also introducing new heroes who make their mark, including the brilliant Doctor Strange and the enigmatic Scarlet Witch.The film's emotional impact is profound, as we witness the bonds of friendship and camaraderie forged among the Avengers tested to their limits. The loss of beloved characters is handled with sensitivity and depth, adding a layer of tragedy and realism that makes the stakes feel incredibly high.Avengers: Infinity War's most defining moment, the one that will forever be etched in the minds of MCU fans, is the ending that leaves half of all life in the universe decimated. This shocking and heartbreaking twist serves as a devastating conclusion to the film, leaving the audience reeling with questions and anticipation for the future of the MCU.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","AlsExGal","26 August 2018","Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan? The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (""Stop Thanos""), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","radursm","3 May 2018","Not everything that glitters is gold! I'd say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars.
Returning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily.
The last ""Avengers"" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season.
Yes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine.But the ""Avengers"" franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back.
""Infinity War"" is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It's a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.
I quote a friend: What's the fool, the one who wrote the screenplay or the one who laughed at the jokes of the ""Guardians of Galaxy""?","

It's a jumble, with explosions/death/violence...with little use or reasoning behind it's constant grinding noise. All the tears shed by actors, had no heart behind it. It's sad when money drives a movie rather than writing. Just because something owns Lucas Industrial Light and Magic, doesn't mean it has to be on screen at all times.

"Avengers: Infinity War","npfares","6 July 2018","I know a lot of you trolls out there are not going to like this review but whatever. 1. To big of a cast. Had too little screen time to be an effective character (all characters) and fit in the plotline effectively. 2. This ties in to not enough screen time, lack of emotional connection to the characters. I simply didn't care that half of the characters died by the end of the movie. Because we all know that most if not all characters are going to return anyway in future movies, it's a financial decision on Marvel's behalf. We all know that these characters are cash cows for Marvel studios so why care that they died when we all know they are going to come back anyway.... 3. Plotline, it had potential but due to time limits done by the studio and editing team it wasn't fully developed (Yes I understand half of you are going to say 'but I want my movie to be an hour and half and mindless fun'. and to rebut that, you can look this up here on imdb, 90%+ of movies that have made the most money and have the highest ratings are at least 2 and half hours long, most being over 3 hours so don't claim to represent the majority). 4. I would have liked this movie a lot more if they would have split it up into 2 movies, which would have been warranted with the material they were using in the movie. In the end, this movie was the 'might have been' movie. Too many 13 year olds went to see this movie who have never went to see movies before this.","

Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a cliché, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...","

"Avengers: Infinity War","SamALMan","9 May 2018","I am not a comic fan.. I never read printed materials on infinity war and now after watching this movie I feel if I have the chance to read it, I will.Anyway.. the movie started where one of the most recent Marvel studio movies ended, Thanos is on quest to collect all the infinity stones to proceed with his plan and while doing so he faces opposition attempts by the avengers and others.You will definitely feel shaken by the first scene in this movie and the shock won't wear out by that scene.. Thanos is determined to collect all the infinity stones even the one that is unknown whereabouts to Marvel movies fans to fulfill his aim.. the aim that made his quest to collect infinity stones understood and analyzed. It hold a real nice philosophical thought that really worth all the time to analyze. The visuals were amazing in this movie, specially for Thanos and the new characters. You can read emotions better on the main ""computer constructed"" character, they are very close to the emotions that you may be able to read from human real face. It is a fast based movie with few ""quiet"" scenes and short scenes with slight laughs here and there to lighten the mood. The characters who appear in this movie have varied screen time but it is noticeable even when some characters get longer screen time, they do not overshadow the efforts of other characters that have lesser screen time. The movie is definitely aiming to please group of audience that appreciate certain types of jokes and references. ********** SPOILER Begin**************
There were no introduction to Thano's snap.. by looking back at Thano's reasons to kill people, I never find it connected to the moment where he snapped his fingers.. he snapped as a impulse or reaction to an avenger attack.. his reasons where corrupted by emotions!.. but definitely showing that Thanos would do anything to have this power in his collection. 
********** SPOILER end**************Marvel studios started a huge project with multiple layers and stages that will make it impossible to wrap it as a perfect project.. you will definitely see slips here and there specially when the other Marvel studios productions seemed connected to this movie. At the end I would say that this movie is more suitable to young audience (to me 40 years and younger). Comics started as a ""relief"" and ended to be an ""art"".. This movie is one of the good examples of a nice modern comic movie.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","brsmarc","23 May 2018","WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI went to see AIW in the hopes of washing away the taste of mediocrity of Black Panther. Having seen pretty much most the other Avengers franchise and predominantly liking them I thought BP was a deviation from the norm but, I now see with AIW's this might be the new normal.This color by numbers film is probably what the average fanboy would hope for: formulaic plot, a who's who of super characters, an odd and apparently solipsistic villain, a barrage of special effects, machines of destruction and a few melodramatic emotionless bonding moments.The entire two hours and twenty odd minutes ends up being nothing more than a long, boring commercial for the sequel (which will also likely dupe the same crowd of lemmings) into forking over $10, $15, $20? for a ticket. The ""deeper"" interpretations will probably dwell on the conflicted nature of Thanos and his complex subtextual commentary of the state of diminishing resources in their world (hint, they mean our world) and the Orwellian double speak where, when he and his henchmen/women go on their intergalactic killing sprees they pronounce (without irony) that they are not murdering, they are liberating. This is the language of dictators, despots and mass murderers (Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler). His insatiable goal to collect the infinity stones for his special glove/gauntlet will give him ultimate power. How serious is this villain about gaining ultimate power? Well he actually trades away his soul (technically its not his) for the ""soul infinity stone"". Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.In this rendition, our friends from prior Marvel movies seem to be not marvelous at all. This is the foundation for every 8 yr old boys ""fighting argument"" (eg: Who would win if Aquaman fought Spiderman? Or ""who's stronger Hulk, Superman or Batman?) fun and engaging sure, if you're an eight year old boy.But what makes this movie such a mess is exactly the notion of more is better. You could put all your favorite foods together on a plate and one look would make you say, ""Yuck, this is disgusting""But its the weight of expectations, need to generate huge box office, and this kind of ""ultimate hero fantasy"" that makes you feel like ""lets simplify"".","

"Avengers: Infinity War","walentys","3 July 2019","The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for ""comedy"" is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a ""lighter"" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for ""comedy"" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film.Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing ""modern Marvel movies"" as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula.The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place?Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were ""just there"". No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into ""one united Avengers"" character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos.The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it.Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","jwag777","9 May 2018","If you get your thrills watching the Avengers get their butt kicked, seeing at least two die, and enjoy the villian being the star of an entire movie, this film is for you! Plus throw in an almost non existent Hulk, a Thor with no hammer (he does get an axe towards the end of the movie), Captain America with a kids toy shield and no mask, and a basically worthless Vision, we'll, you get it. I know this a two-parter and a lot of what happened will be rectified, but it was still a huge disappointment to me. Did enjoy some of the hero pairings and the humor was mostly funny, but it wasn't nearly enough for me.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","hotjanuary","13 May 2018","Infinity War is a good super hero movie. But I thought Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther were better.Marvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies.
1) if a battle between the Hulk and Thor in Ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat I'm pretty sure Hulk vs Thanos in a spaceship would last one punch.2) Star-lord is just a dude, he does not catch and hold Spider-man.3) If Tony Stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in Iron Man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in Waconda? I'm sure War Machine would have access to activate them.4) If Scarlet Witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near Wakonda why do 2 dudes in Scotland give her a hard time?5) Steve Rogers isn't invulnerable. When swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth he's apparently unharmed after Thor's hammer clears the baddies away. They had time to rip Steve up but didn't?Don't take the easy way out when writing the story. A lot of it was good but some of it was not. Writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief.
1) When an elaborate plan pins Thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he can't DESTROY THE UNIVERSE nobody would stop to talk to Thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe. At the very least you shut up and HELP REMOVE THE GAUNTLET so Thanos can't destroy the UNIVERSE!2) Gamora really thinks Thanos doesn't love her? All that time she was talking about Thanos not loving anyone made no sense. I kept thinking, Gamora, you're being really stupid, everybody knows what's going to happen... maybe you should try running or anything?3) When Thor arrives at Wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump/smash. Banner even feels he has time to stop, open his helmet to say ""You guys are so screwed now!"". But when all the heroes go to protect Vision from Thanos.... Thor arrives AFTER Thanos gets the last stone?I know I'm picking. It's because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and I'd rather not have anymore X-men The Last Stand or Fantastic Four (2015).","

Towards the end there were so much of the same going on that you don't feel any empathy anymore of the entire Avengers crews when they died one by one, and you start to think the Universe might aswell be perished, who cares....cant stand the fact that this movies continue to go on and on, and wishing for it to end!

"Avengers: Infinity War","glofau","2 May 2018","A movie should stand on its own two feet as an entertainment experience. You shouldn't have to watch 18 other movies first in order to enjoy a film. Unfortunately, to enjoy Avengers: Infinity War, you really have to have seen all the other MCU films or this film doesn't really make any sense. Hell, they rarely even introduce characters by name, let alone give you any clue as to who these people are. It really takes shalllowness to a whole new level of yawn-inducing ennui.It's not like I haven't seen any other Marvel superhero movies; I've seen several. When I was a kid, I read the comic books. And I still had no clue who most of the characters in this movie were! And I certainly didn't give two hoots whether they lived or died.The film is a spectacular, eye-popping kaleidoscope of sumptuous costumes, special effects, and MONEY spent lavishly on just about everything. The salaries for the all-star cast alone must have sucked up a huge portion of the film's budget. But who cares? If you weren't already invested in the characters, you aren't going to become invested in this sea of nameless wisecrackers spewing rather clever (but pointless) dialogue endlessly.I couldn't make it to the end, I walked out about halfway through. I hear the end is the best part but I couldn't summon enough interest to care. They lost me with the meaningless major death early in the picture. Snore! I don't go to a film to see favorite characters bite the dust! Especially since they'll just have to resurrect people so they can make their various contracted sequels in their own franchises. This film is an expensive waste of time unless you're a rabid fan.It's all about the story, man! Without a good story and some time spent up front getting you invested in the main characters, a movie is nothing. Black Panther was terrific because it had a terrific script but this film sucked rocks because its script was a shallow, mediocre snooze despite the witty repartee. Don't bother unless you're a big fan of the MCU.","

there is no any fight I see from captaion and black panther, just a few punches.
even end was not that good. I thought this movie will be better than first one but now I know first one will always stay best from all.Tony didn't stay in earth and I didn't like it.
action scene were good but not compared to what we saw in civil war.
This is very big movie, there must be some scenes and actions which supposed to be unforgattable. You will also feel at least one time that this isn't movie about avengers or saving earth/universe. its about thanos and gamora story. good time wasted there. No complicated plots. plot holes. no combination of music/sound. 
no interesting and emotional plot like civil war and doc. strange movie.I hope next part will be better than this.

"Avengers: Infinity War","RoBiN_SinGH211221","30 September 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","

His infamosity isn't just his power (Dormammu and Hela are more powerful) but that other than Kilmonger, he's the only other MCU antagonist with understandable motives that audiences can truly believe in.I understand MCU movies aren't realistic documentaries, but there is no way Thanos should have been the winner in the movie. Thor and Hulk may not have beaten him, but they should have done more damage. On Thanos' home planet, even though he had multiple infinity stones, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Star Lord, Drax, and Mantis should have taken Thanos down with their collective strengths.And the ending. Oh my. The most emotional, breathtaking cliffhanger in the history of television. So much so, that Endgame grossed over a billion dollars on opening weekend.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","ssatvaya-16480","19 June 2021","AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on...
Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb .....,
Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".","

Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic cliché formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and cliché There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.","

He is a great character, it is pretty much his movie. Continuing how great he was in Thor: Ragnarok, Chris Hemsworth steals the movie as Thor!! No mean feat in a movie with this many awesome characters. Robert Downey Jr is as awesome as always (when isn't he??) as is Tom Holland, he made me cry, it not going to lie. Mark Ruffallo has more to do than normal as Bruce Banner.Chris Evans and Benedict Cumberbatch are more supporting here as is Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany (even though I was crushed with there final scene) Sadly, Scarlett Johansson is wasted here!!

"Avengers: Infinity War","judemcrobbie","20 March 2021","I have basically nothing but praise for Avengers: Infinity War. Considering the rest of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are very safe and don't take many risks or deviate from their generic formula, this does. These movies will go down in cinema history, for better or for worse, and I do truly believe this deserves to be there.
There are plenty of reasons this is the best MCU instalment and one of the better movies of the decade:
The primary reason is the villain, Thanos. He played spectacularly by Josh Brolin, who even in motion capture gets all the acting through. The MCU has had such weak villains throughout so to see Thanos done so well is a great change. I think the genius behind how Thanos is the best villain is because the way the movie cleverly poses the question ""Could he be right?"". This gives him not only a sense of moral righteousness to us but we can truly see the ""No one thinks they're the villain"" philosophy making him so compelling. The opening scene of the movie shows the mad titan effortlessly slaughtering families in his quest to destroy half the population of the universe. He seems completely unfazed by this like he's done it before countless times. There is a clever line of exposition in this after this, not only backing it up that he has (That we will see a flash back showing he's been doing it for at least 20 years) but also how he got the first stone. I like this decision to say rather than show this as it puts us in the action of the people we actually have emotional resonance with, The Asgardians. Throughout this scene we see the two previously strongest characters, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), get not only beat down by Thanos but humiliated. This is especially prevalent in the hulk as we don't see the fight between Thor and Thanos. We do get to see the fight between The Hulk and Thanos however. This is one of the best set pieces in the franchise as not only is it bombastic action but also shows character for both of them, but especially Thanos. Through a mere few counterattacks, Thanos decimates The Hulk. This shows the brains he has, not fighting like the animal The Hulk does, and showing he also has the strength to go toe to toe with the previous strongest avenger. The genius behind the decision to show the brains is that t circles back to when in the final fight he says ""You're not the only one cursed with knowledge"". In this scene we also see the smarts of Thanos, outsmarting the God of Mischief-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He ultimately kills both Loki and Heimdall (Idris Elba), the final remaining people from Thor's previous life before the first Thor and the avengers. I think the next time we see Thanos on screen is in the Knowhere scene. In this he uses his grip over the weapons he has gathered, showing their abilities and his ability over them by cutting through The Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff) with ease and going as far as to turn our beloved Mantis and Drax into Spaghetti and just blocks respectively. There is a lot more in this scene which I could talk about, Peter's arrogance and the Guardians dysfunctional family ultimately leading to their downfall to the hand of a competent villain, but I will elect to talk on the emotional climax of the scene, Peter Quill attempting to kill the love of his life in order to save humanity but getting the rugged pulled out from underneath him. This leaves Peter in a complete state of disarray as if he had killed he would have felt immense guilt for killing the one true love of his life, and if he hadn't then he may have just doomed the universe. No win situations like these are perfect for developing character as we get to see them in difficult situations. This drives Peter and the rest of The Guardians the rest of the movie. There is two more Thanos scenes I would like to would like to talk about: the first of which is the Nebula torture scene. This is a truly perfect scene compared to the many others. Marvel has a tendency to crack jokes unnecessarily, which I'll get into later, but this is just completely devoid of all that humour which is just perfect. The fact Gamora says ""I always hated that chair"" and Thanos deciding to bring himself to the lower level, not feeling the need to assert his dominance over her sets up the next scene perfectly, and then the other thing in this scene is the decision for the 'Mad Titan' no to torture Gamora and instead torturing Nebula, again this makes the next scene perfectly. Then the final scene of the Thanos chat is the Vormir/Soul Stone scene. This scene is just chilling. When Red Skull (Ross Marquand) pronounces that you must give a soul you love for the soul stone, the reactions from both Thanos and Gamora are just amazing. Thanos goes completely silent, null and void he thinks over what he must do. The tear shed shows the pain perfectly set up in the previously alluded scene, but understanding he must do what he must do. In his eyes it means crossing the fate over the universe over his daughter and the only person he ever truly loved. Gamora in this scene is fantastic as well. She originally believes that Thanos doesn't love anyone and therefore he will fail, going as far as to taunt him about it. At the beginning the taunts come thick and fast but they slow down with her voice realising there's only one thing he loves. The climax of Gamora trying to kill herself instead of having to give the stone to Thanos is what makes the scene so great, giving the moral compass of The Guardians and she carries that to her grave ultimately.
Another reason for this being this being the best instalment in the franchise is because of the writing and acting for/from every character:
Iron Man is the man who started all this and Robert Downey Jr. gives a trademark performance. He brings the narcissism and arrogance that comes with the character. He also shows the swagger but more he brings arguably the fourth personality trait of Iron Man's tenure. This iteration brings the most human Iron Man. He has always had obsessions but in this the obsession is with having a child. This is started as far back as Captain America: Civil War (2016) with the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland). In this Spider-Man was easily the youngest superhero, he was still in high school, so Tony Stark saw him as a child, which later became his child of sorts. This is emanated as the same you want to push your child but not to the point of harm, Tony brings Peter Parker into the fight to expand the help for Team Iron Man or whatever it's called, but at the first sign of real danger he tells him to leave. This is carried over to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) where we see Iron Man as the mentor, Uncle Ben figure of the MCU. To those who don't understand that, Uncle Ben in Spider-Man is the man who teaches Peter humility and ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Tony Stark has this trait in this as he teaches Peter not to thrill-seek and do it for the greater cause, what Tony Stark had to learn 9 years prior in the first instalment of the MCU, Iron Man (2008). I say all of this because he gets annoyed at Peter for getting on the spaceship as he is fully aware that it could be a one way trip. The line Peter says ""I can't be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man if there's no neighbourhood"" encapsulates the lessons taught to him in the previous instalments of his character in other MCU movies. Then to see Peter die in his arms has to be the killing blow, comparable to losing a child. Not only does Tony feel this, but because of all the time spent developing their relationship in other movies and this one, we the audience also feel this like the dagger Tony Stark has just been stabbed with, both physically and emotionally. The back and forth between Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Iron Man is brilliant, it evokes the feeling when two of the worlds greatest but heads, like Messi and Ronaldo or Lebron and Curry. The ""I speak for myself"" from Doctor Strange is completely unnecessary and he just affirms Tony Stark's point but it shows however on the same tea, they are very much at each other's throats. This is even more apparent when in the spaceship Tony and Peter save Doctor Strange by blowing a hole and releasing the vacuum. Doctor Strange doesn't thank the pair but proceeds to make an indirect threat to them, saying he will not hesitate to not save them in aid to keep the Time stone. Also another 'alpha' character in Peter Quill joins them on Titan. This throws another problem as he has no willingness to listen to anyone but himself.
Thor is clearly fighting out of vengeance towards Thanos. Though not all by the hand of Thanos, in the last 3 features of Thor he has lost his father-Odin (Anthony Hopkins), his mother-Frigga (Rene Russo), his brother-Loki, and his four of his best friends in Heimdall and the warriors three (Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano). This man has seen everyone die around him so the guilt he must feel is through the roof. This is said by Mantis when trying to empathise with him. He is very much motivated in this by vengeance, it is because of this he is so powerful as he has ""Nothing left to lose"". This gives Thor the reckless abandon needle to take on Thanos alone or take the weight of a star to form his weapon. The will to take the weight, heat and energy of a star shows how much he was connected to Mjolnir. In very much way the the Tardis feels like a person in Doctor Who (1963-Present), Mjolnir had a sense around it that it was more than just a weapon, not just how Thor and it interacted but it's perfect timing and the noise it makes feeling like a language. Speaking of people Thor has lost, Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was destroyed early by Hela (Cate Blanchett). There isn't enough words doc for me to get it all in","

"Avengers: Infinity War","daendil","6 May 2018","Warning: spoilers.There is not much one anticipates from a superhero movie. Spectacle (with lots of CGI), iconic characters, some basic story arc, and saving the world in the end.
Infinity War didn't deliver. And I hate to utter that. I hate to command movies to stay within they genre... But if they don't, there must be reason. There must be good reason. The makers stripped this movie of the most important superhero-flick-features and what remains, just falls apart.First of all, there are way too many characters (could this have been the reason behind the ""end result""?). And then the story arc: it's a downward spiral. The heroes try to stop the villain(s) at multiple locations only to fail one time after another, letting the villain march through with his plan and collect each and every one of the stones. And finally the world is not saved. The end. Cast. Oh, wow. Thank you.Now for the spectacle: that was ok - though most of the fight scenes were too shaky and chaotic for me. I would have preferred less and more detailed scenes, but I don't complain. It a little bit felt like a Japanese anime though, where one combatant pulls a big ass weapon only to have their opponent pull an even bigger ass weapon, and on and on, until one time an entire moon (!) was dropped onto our heroes...For the positives: we did have some good laughs, and the main villain is well detailed (for a superhero movie). Also, Peter Dinklage!Lastly I hate to be blackmailed to watch next episode like this. So no, I will not watch the next one, at least not in the movie theater.","

I had no idea what was going on and the tedious CGI and probable impossible situations and loud music and interminable explosions made this a tortuous event to sit through. I recommend that if you go, you must be a fan of the genre otherwise it will produce a terrible tension headache. The popcorn was good, however.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","BA_Harrison","28 April 2018","A mean, ugly purple dude scours the universe for the pretty gems that fit into his snazzy metal gauntlet, intent on using the power of the stones for his own nefarious needs. It is up to a team of brave superheroes to try and stop him.I've fallen way behind on my MCU, and am probably not the best person to comment on this latest instalment; or maybe, just maybe, my objectivity makes me more suited than most avid fanboys.For the best part of two hours I was reasonably entertained by what unfolded, despite not knowing the backstory to several of the characters. The plot was pretty easy to pick up, the action scenes were visually impressive, and there was never a lull in pace. It was slick, big-budget popcorn fodder designed to appeal to the masses, but which hardly qualified as revolutionary or indeed, all that memorable. Eventually, I could feel tedium creeping in. And then the last act changed everything...The finalé, in which half the population of the entire universe ceases to exist, makes Avengers: Infinity War a movie that lingers in the mind long after it has ended. Spiderman, gone. Dr. Strange, gone. Black Panther, gone. Groot, gone. And many more besides. Well-established characters vanish in the blink of an eye, and I have to admit feeling a lump in my throat at their casual dismissal. It's a bold move, for sure, and one that will guarantee discussion from all that stay the distance (which reminds me, be sure to remain seated for the now obligatory after credits scene).6/10 for the first two hours or so, but that ending... I'll be generous and add a couple of extra points for Marvel having the balls to go ahead with it.***EDIT*** Having pondered the fate of so many superheroes, I now expect Marvel to bring most of them back to life in the next film via Dr. Strange's powers of time manipulation-not such a ballsy move after all. My rating might be reduced to 7/10 if this is the case.***","

"Avengers: Infinity War","plasticanimalz","15 July 2018","I wasn't going to bother with a review but then I read the first review by blparker that said everyone giving this a bad score were trolls who didn't see the film, then went on to praise it like it was Citizen Kane. I found that rather humorous. My suggestion is to see this in the theatre as the VFX are the only thing it has going for it and won't translate on the small screen. I had no idea this was a 2 hr and 40 min film until I bought the ticket and I seriously contemplated walking into another film because I just did not expect much from this film. When the film started it poorly leapt straight into a scene as if we were in the middle of the movie rather than the beginning. It didn't make a lot of sense other than a set up for on of the long-standing characters to die. Once we moved past this terrible scene it got a little better, which kept me in my seat 'cause the first 10 mins of the film made me want to leave the movie as I was afraid the rest of the film would be like this. It doesn't get much better but at the very least it manages to be entertaining.There is a plot, though, there is very little to it. If you know anything of the Infinity comic, which also was not that great, you know that a lot of characters die. The difference is they killed characters in the comic I cared about and the movies they don't even bother to have those characters, so, whatever. Secret Wars was a much better comic and tells how Spider-Man got his black suit, but it had actual story, so, I guess they didn't want to use a better comic. Infinity truly is one big dude fight. But not even that exciting of action. I thought the Black Panther action was better. I'd read that a bunch of guys don't like Rey from Star Wars because she's a Mary Sue, which I learned means a woman with ultimate, unstoppable powers. Funny, I've never heard a name for guys but they bothered to come up with one for women. Basically, every dude in this film is a Mary Sue. If Thor has the power to resist a star how is it he can't get out of a couple steel girders a wizard wraps around him? How is Captain America always so invincible? He was always kind of a lame character but now he's all-powerful in this universe. Why is Spider-Man suddenly Iron Man? What is the point of Vision, for someone so powerful he doesn't seem to do much other than whine.I did think Dr. Strange was cooler than his own movie in this film. Tony Stark, always likable. Thor was very enjoyable, and I loved his scenes with the Star Jammers. Peter Parker's humor was funny and I liked him better in this film than Homecoming. The best scenes for me were the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Pretty much everything they do is good. The best comedic line was from the bald Black Panther woman, which, unfortunately they didn't show that much of her. In fact, this was a 2 hr 40 min movie with only 2-3 minutes of screen time for the few female characters they've bothered to add to the film Marvel Universe, who are mostly only in the films to make the guys not look gay. The Scarlett Witch seemed to be one of the most powerful characters yet her few scenes were only dedicated to talking about how much she loves Vision and fawning all over this boring robot guy who doesn't seem to have emotion. Yep, a real attractor for women. Black Widow has been lame from the start. A Shield Agent with no powers whom they've given laser guns to, on the team with a bunch of super powered dudes and a god. Lame. There's a long assortment of Marvel super power females they could have added to Avengers but they literally just added someone to look hot. It really annoyed me how underused all the female characters were in this film. Black Panther's sister was the star of the Black Panther film and she has no purpose in the Avenger film other than to cut out Vision's stone. She's basically an extra.I've never kept much up on Thanos 'cause he's a relatively boring character who wasn't very often used in the Marvel universe for the 10 years I read Marvel comics. I think he was more of a Silver Surfer or Rom villain...which, did anyone actually read those? I thought the idea that balance is used as bad and evil was a bad message. What is he now, an eco-terrorist? He didn't seem so much crazy as a Green Peace dude with too much power. Thanos chose people at random so he wasn't a racist, a bigot, or anything else, he was by the films portrayal an environmentalist. Humans thin out animals when they ravage the terrain. How is it different? I go to films to be entertained, not have these poorly plotted out existentialism by stoners moments. In the past 6 months, Infinity War, Jurassic World, and The Last Jedi all had these nihilist themes or moments where they are trying to express some weak, childish form of morality but it is actually anti-heoric, selfish, immoral, or just lame.I, in some way applaud the writers for making the film mildly entertaining despite the amount of characters they were working with. That is a challenge. But, overall there wasn't much story going on or actual emotion so I really didn't care when they killed off a good chunk of the heroes. All I could think was, ""Oh, his contract is up, so they're killing him off. They didn't use her anyway, so, of course she's dead. Oh, well, he's a new actor every 2 or 3 movies, so, no surprise."" Didn't care. The entire film was fairly unmemorable and my life could have continued just fine without seeing it.","

 I'm not sure if Disney paid people to rate this movie this high or people turn off their brains before watching this or most people prefer destruction and people punching each other over a good storyline. 6/10 because the visuals were stunning.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","jtindahouse","2 May 2018","There are some films that simply can not be reviewed without going into spoilers. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' is one of them, so fair warning. I watch roughly 150 films each year and yet this is the first MCU movie I have seen. Not a single one of them up until now appealed to me. What finally got me along to see this one? Well the fact that it is currently sitting in the top 10 of the IMDb Top 250 had a little to do with it. I had to see what all the fuss was about. There are some truly tremendous and groundbreaking films in that list and the top 10 in particular holds some of the greatest films ever made. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' has no business being there.There are a lot of characters in this movie to keep up with and it is frankly exhausting at times. Admittedly, the film actually does a pretty god job of balancing everyone and giving them sufficient screen time and a purpose for being in the movie. There are so many characters though and so many story arcs that it can become a little frustrating waiting for the good ones to role around again. What I've learnt is that there are some incredibly strong characters in this universe ('Iron Man' was the stand-out for me) and some phenomenally weak characters too ('Captain America' probably being the weakest from what I could ascertain). The strongest thing the movie has going for it is the character of 'Thanos'. A genuinely intimidating, menacing and threatening villain is always the key to any superhero movie being good. Josh Brolin plays him brilliantly (as he always does) and this film owes a lot to that character alone.Now let's get into those spoilers by talking about the ending. Basically 'Thanos' wins and with the click of his fingers kills half the universe. We then see roughly half of the superheroes crumble into nothing and ""die"" (supposedly). I suspect this has a lot to do with the film having such a high IMDb rating. It turns out people love an ending where the bad guys win. That makes me happy, because it doesn't happen anywhere near enough in Hollywood today. My problem with the ending though is this. If you really think those characters are dead, never to be seen again, then you are sorely mistaken. So in that sense it is incredibly cheap. I hate movies (universes) where a character dying doesn't actually mean they're dead (DC is just as guilty of this sadly). As if this isn't obvious enough to 90% of people, the film actually reminds of you of this fact not 5 minutes prior when a character is killed only for 'Thanus' to go back a few moments in time and thus bring him back to life.Enjoy this film for what it is. It's a great looking flick, with some excellent action sequences, funny one-liners and a menacing villain with a clear and simple plot that is easy to follow. It's done well no one could deny that, but don't try and claim that is something truly great and worthy of the IMDb top 10 because that is simply not the case.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","yaszi-83296","10 November 2021","This is the movie! A decade of build up for this, and it was really good! The movie is just 2. Hours and 30. Minutes of pure action, people that were fans, were not fans or think they are fans watched this movie around the whole world, their are groups of characters that fight for the same thing and as the movie goes on, more and more characters group together until there is only pretty much 1 big group of heroes. This movie is unique because the heroes aren't the protagonist, it's kinda the amazing villain Thanos, he is emotionally driven and his story is great, he is kinda a hero, he thinks wiping out half the universe is necessary to safe the universe from problems caused by overpopulation, he knows it is crazy and solving a problem means trying not to hurt anyone but he believes he has to do it! He is constantly getting hammered by the heroes and you kinda feel bad for him, there is no villain. This is why he is a great villain, he is not trying to be a menace out to blow the world, he is trying to do his part and save it.Another thing I love is that anyone can watch it, anyone can enjoy it even do they don't care about marvel, the MCU works in a way that someone only has to watch some movies to understand that there is a connection with these stones, and someone going after all of them is a big deal! The movie is it's own think and is pure fun superhero action, it is great and truly has a infinite amount of fun.The movie is a must watch and is the big event in a way, it is kinda the first part and the second being Avengers Endgame, both movies are their one story at the same time as being a part of this now over a decade long franchise. This is basically perfect and even do it might not be for everyone, this is just amazing!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","nogodnomasters","5 May 2018","This is an easy film to spoil, so I will keep it brief. Thanos (Josh Brolin) gathers a group of bad guys with the quest of obtaining all the infinity stones. His goal is to save the universe by killing off half of its life with the snap of a finger...and enjoy the sunset. The film combines all the Marvel characters available to do a film to fight the villains and Stan Lee to play a bus driver. The feature assumes you have seen all the other films as there is zero introduction of character, and hopes you have forgotten a few minor details that conflict with the current film. The film is generally darker than previous films, but still has the humor. I wished Star Lord had discovered a new tape whereby he could defeat Thanos. Not thrilled with the plot or ending. The production works with 3 subplots for much of the feature. The ending...well we know what happens next with a go back in time and let's hose this series up like they did X-Men.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","bunsen2019","2 May 2018","SPOILER: The plot follows Thanos around on his quest to collect 5 stones, achieve control of all dimensions and eliminate half of humanity in an attempt to save planets from population induced ecosystem destruction/annihilation. Each stone quest involves 10 minutes or so of the same CGI fighting. Why 5 stones? Why not, they've got time to fill. Lots and lots of time. Many of the characters are likeable esp the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Hulk and Tony Stark BUT, there are just too many groups involved with too much repetition. The plot is mildly interesting daring to touch on overpopulation crisis. Thanos makes a good point. Though in true Hollywood style, he goes about it the wrong way. He should have sterilized half the planet, not dissolve them.","

Sure, non-stop action with all your favorite heroes and foes, yet an overly fast paced plot leaves only the outstanding SFX to remember when you feel cheated by the ending, and knowing you have to wait another year to close-out the mystery. So until then, you have to jump to your own conclusions. Not a fan of these type of plots. Still, exciting and well directed and acted. A generous 9/10 from me.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","l-r-patrick","2 May 2018","Firstly, special effects were really good, cast was also very good! I grew up reading these comics and Thanos along with Doctor Doom were my two favorite bad guys!
Thanos is very good in this film, it's just the writers obviously don't know the comics very, or just think they are better than the likes of Stan Lee and Jim Starlin who
was the person that created Thanos. Thanos kills to please Lady Death, he does not kill just because he thinks there's to many people, what a stupid idea that was.
I mean if he is worried about there not being enough resources for the population, once he has the infinity gauntlet, he can solve that by creating enough resources for
everyone! It would have been so simple to have Thanos worshipping Lady Death, her just silently watching, and him, as in the comics trying to gain her attention by 
killing to please her, but that was to complicated for the writers to put in, as audiences would not know who she was, lol. Self explained by Thanos, easily done, 
we've not seen the dwarf before, but he magically appeared, I mean, that was another waste of a whole sequence, Thor trying to get a hammer made (Beta Ray Bills 
hammer btw), I mean WTF, just have his proper hammer rejuvinate and hold the power, oh yeah, these writers wanted to change that part of the story as well.
These writers need to know, Stan, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko etc etc wrote and created these characters and they should stick to the original elements that made them
what they are today. They think they can come along and rewrite these stories in their vision, just like JJ Abrahams with Star Wars and Star Trek, they think they are
better than the original creators which they are not by any means!For me it's getting to the point where I don't really care if I see these films anymore, they just let me down every time, where these writers don't do the proper research
and just create it in their own way. The comic fans made the comics a success, without us over the years, there would be no films, so maybe you should try to please the
fans before the random cinema goers?Bits that really annoy me, no Lady Death or any celestial power beings of any kind, Red skull appears on the planet galaxies away to Thanos about the sould gem, great writing
there, true to the comics, NOT! Boy that sucked, I thought, why is this not at least Mephisto here or Lady Death, Red Skull, it's so bad I want to cry.
The Hulk was not really in the film, just the first few minutes, they just wanted to give the actor face time, so just had him jumping around in the Hulk buster outfit, yawn!This film is an insult to The Infinity Gauntlet Comics, go and read Thanos Quest, then The Infinity Gauntlet 1-6 and wait for this on normal TV.Totally ruined one of my favorite story lines, these writers need to get over themselves and not write it as if they think it's their creation, it's not!Best bit in the film for me, was Stan Lee's cameo!5/10 but should have been an easy 10.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","milleniumlogan","3 May 2018","This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans. The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. 
Star-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy. Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot. Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene. Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense. Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie. Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth. Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU.","

Its plot is a series of battle set-pieces, in which a cast overstuffed with hero figures engage in pointless fights with an unbeatable enemy. The dialogue is throwaway, the scenes of human interaction brief and trivial, and the moral seems to be ""you can't win"". The ending is particularly offensive, because it violates the prime rule of narrative-- providing the viewer with a sense of closure. At the end (almost) everybody dies and then. . .The End. Tiresome, overwrought, and banal","

"Avengers: Infinity War","daveh28","23 May 2018","I really liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Likewise Iron Man & The Avengers. But these never-ending franchise add-ons are pretty boring unless you're 12 or a CGI junkie. There's very little evidence of a story behind all of the mind-boggling action, over acted drama, and special effects. It drives me nuts anymore, when fighting takes a 5 minute 'time out' for a lame, ""poignant"" dialog scene. I guess that I've seen too many of these to enjoy them anymore.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","searchingfortao","27 April 2018","I've watched every MCU movie at least twice. I love them all, even Iron Man 2, but this was terribly disappointing. This whole thing gave me the impression that the writers watched a lot of Game of Thrones and thought: ""I know what people like, let's kill a bunch of heroes!"" Even if the fight scenes devolved to the absurd, it didn't matter, we had good guys dying, so this would be a win.Now obviously it's a comic book movie, so it's a safe bet that most if not all of the heros they killed will somehow miraculously be resurrected, but that's not the point. I just paid £12 to watch characters I fell in love with get murdered for 2 hours only to have it wrap up with half of everyone dying. Now I get to wait an entire year to find out how they're going to fix it.If I wanted to get punched in the stomach, I'm sure I could find someone to do it for less than £12 and 2 hours of my time.","

It doesn't seem that the movie ends so much as two-thirds of the way in the writers got bored and said ""let's just phone in a bunch of failures and quit. Note: bad guy winning doesn't automatically make dramatic tension. And you can't just write the characters acting stupid to make them lose. If you'd done your job, there could have been legitimate reasons for failure, not just you writing ""even though their lives are at stake and they are seconds away from getting off Thanos's glove, let's have Chris's Pratt say 'No! I will not hold on one second and beat on him after you get the glove off, I will do it now!' because darn it, it's too tough to expect us to come up with a good reason they fail."" How about having some of Thanos's followers show up and prevent it? There are so many other problems with the last third, I swear it was written completely separate from the rest. AnAndd what about a simple ""The battle continues in..."" All in all, skip this one and wait for the next.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","tfminfl","13 January 2019","303. Avengers: Infinity War. Heres what I get... There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Droid army Vs the Naboo... only now it was Thermos' computer viruses Vs Wakanda... you're sayin that wasn't intentional? Filmbufftim on FB.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","TheMovieDoctorful","14 November 2018","No matter what people think about me or my opinions, I wanted to like this film more than anyone. I love superheroes, I love Marvel and as much as I criticize the MCU for being safe and formulaic, there are several Marvel Cinematic Universe films that I've loved (The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the first 2 Captain America movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther to name the big ones). And I love that this movie enthralled and captivated many of my friends, a good number of them calling this one of their favorite movies of all time. However, the truth of the matter is that Avengers: Infinity War disappointed me. It deeply let me down. It's not an absolute failure and I certainly wouldn't call it irredeemable, but I can't say I find it to be a good film either.In terms of positives, the first one to come to mind would obviously be the jolly, purple giant himself, Thanos. He's undoubtedly one of the most interesting and developed villains in the MCU to date and he's acted phenomenally by Josh Brolin. I commend the creative team for keeping Thanos utterly despicable and villainous while still making him a compelling enough lead for us to be invested in his dark mirror of the Hero's Journey. It's fascinating to see an arc like this, full of sacrifice, struggle and personal loss concluding in an ultimate triumph, be translated to a villain without losing any of the qualities that keep him monstrous. He is a fully rounded, fully realized, human character; just not one who's a good person.As someone who hated Tom Holland's Spider-Man in both Civil War and Homecoming, I actually liked his performance and characterization here. The high stakes consequences of the story allow Holland to go to emotional places he simply wasn't allowed to before and his relationship with Tony Stark carries much more emotional weight, relatability and humanity to it than either of his previous two films. Maybe there's hope for this Spider-Man after all.Most (Keyword; most) of the content regarding the Guardians of the Galaxy is done wonderfully. Dave Bautista's Drax and Pom Klementieff's Mantis act wonderfully off of all the Avengers they get to interact with and it's nice to see that MCU teamup movies have moved and matured beyond thinking that every teamup movie needs all the team members to hate each other and fight over nonsense for 2 acts. Chris Pratt's performance as Starlord is truly heartbreaking and I commend the team behind Infinity War to have the guts to painfully strip away everything this character ever loved. For all my problems with the film, Starlord's emotional breakdown at Thanos after learning of Gamora's death is actually a major highlight of the movie for me. It's a deeply human and relatable moment that Pratt acts with such intensity and power.I also found myself really invested in the love story of Vision and Wanda. Elizabeth Olsen and Kevin Bettany have beautiful chemistry and their calm, soft moments before the storm bring a real gentleness and quiet beauty to the film. Scarlet Witch being forced to kill the only man she ever loved to save half the universe was by far the most emotionally powered moment of the movie and it's such a shame these two got so little screentime.That's the biggest problem of the film for me. Characters getting little screentime. Infinity War is deeply overstuffed, it has characters by the dozens and no idea what to do with a good half of them. Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Black Panther, the Hulk; all of these characters (As well as the side characters they're associated with) could be completely removed from the film and nothing would change. And yet, I'm supposed to feel the epic weight of their massive battle with the army of Thanos despite their importance to the story being minimal at best and non-existent at worst?The ending felt cheap to me rather than dramatic and emotional. The only deaths to really affect me were Vision and Spider-Man. The rest (Minus Gamora, whose death is too awkwardly edited and weirdly toned down from a violence standpoint to affect me until Starlord's reaction, and Loki, who has been seemingly killed and brought back to life so many times that I hardly buy he's finally dead) die with little to no reaction from their friends and comrades when that's exactly what we needed. We don't get to see Rogers react to losing both of his closest friends or the rest of the Guardians all dying together. It's all such blatant sequel baiting, especially with many of the characters (Including Loki) already having future MCU films or TV shows announced. Gee, I guess they're all just going to center on piles of sand, huh? This kind of sequel baiting conclusion is hardly ""new"" or ""bold"" or ""inventive."" In fact, it's pretty much what the MCU already did with Captain America: Civil War.Speaking of, as much as people want to give Guardians Vol. 2 crap for not balancing the comedy and drama well, where were your criticisms here? Towards a movie that starts making pop culture reference jokes almost immediately after Gamora's death, hardly even giving us a moment of mourning or reflection? A movie that hardly ever gives us a moment for pause for Thor to mourn Loki? I'm sure there was ambition in here somewhere, but in the end, everything got overpowered by the Marvel formula and tone for me.No, Infinity War isn't terrible, but I simply think it bit off more than it could chew. However, everything is set up for Part II to blow me away. I'm still holding out hope for this stage of the MCU to end in a high note for me.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","hp-33729","6 August 2018","I'm not really a Marvel fan, but I did enjoy some of their movies and like some of their characters. Apparently this movie is a culmination of all the previous storylines in the Marvel universe, so this time they made sure to _really_ go over the top with it to please the fans. All your favorite characters are there doing their own thing to fight against the main villain in an end game that feels like it's 7 hours long. With so many characters and so many parallel storylines I found it hard to focus or care about anything and just tuned out, like when you're watching a very long battle in a Transformers movie that has no consequences whatsoever and the movie loses you and you start to ask yourself why you're not doing anything useful with your life instead of watching that nonsense.It's probably just me as I'm not really interested in this universe in general and the main villain is kind of disappointing in my opinion, but be warned, if you're not a die hard fan either, you will probably be bored to death just like me.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","s3276169","30 July 2018","The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel. This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh. The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks ""all the same"". On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer. That said this film is what it is. I've seen it all before and I'd be hard pressed to want to see it all again. 5/10 from me.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","haydenluz","13 August 2020","Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've.Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","ryfin","8 November 2021","I adore this movie, and it is by far my favorite MCU movie. Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.","

The movie is more of a Thanos story which is fine as we need to know as much about this Titan, however the rest just didn't measure up.I understand getting some 30 characters together in one movie was always going to be a stretch, but I really didn't enjoy the movie. I won't delve into the plot as many reviewers have done so, I will just say that some of the action sequences were pretty good especially from Iron Man and Dr Strange, but ultimately the ending really agitated me and yes, we all know there will be another movie soon to complete this story but it just felt like a setup movie.Not as epic as everyone is making it out to be. I still rather watch the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier and even Ragnarok over this any day.","

The power balance between characters strength and weaknesses seemed flawed. One character would be in peril from X weapon in one scene but then beat a more powerful weapon Y in another scene. Movies attain suspension of disbelief by setting and following rules. These rules seemed sloppily applied but all in all it wasn't as bad as Venom...","

"Avengers: Infinity War","FabledGentleman","25 April 2018","MAJOR SPOILERS!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!My headline is the easy way to describe this movie. It is grand, majestic and spectacular. Just like Thanos towering everyone else with his physique this movie also stands above everything else, at least most of it. Because wow, this movie is really something to behold. Marvel went all in with everything here, the cgi is phenomenal, the acting is great, the story is well told, the pacing is near perfect. I have seen this movie twice in IMAX 3D and once in 4DX now, and i have never seen a movie with better image quality than this one, never.Ever since the MCU started with Iron Man i have seen every film released, most of them are good, some are outright great, a few are mediocre and very few are bad. But for the most part it has been a hell of a ride, and I've eagerly been awaiting this movie for quite some time, we all knew that it would come down to this, but were you prepared for what would be the outcome? Not many were, though many of us knew several avengers and other major characters would die in this film, i did not expect it to be this many.This movie truly didn't waste any time getting down to business, as before ten minutes had passed, Heimdall and Loki are killed, and we see the Titan kick the crap out of Hulk, this set the tone for the entire movie right of the bat, and was IMO a smart move, now we knew for sure what a badass Thanos is, and this was before he got all the stones.What the Russo brothers have done here is to overdo themselves. Winter Soldier and Civil War are two of the best MCU movies to date, and you got to wonder how Marvel found these guys, and knew what they were capable of, because Infinity War just lifted the bar even higher. This movie is sort of Michael Bay's wet dream, this is what he wants to achieve, but never can because he has no idea how to tell a story or handle emotions. This movie is a 2 hour and 30 minute spectacle, which has action scene after action scene lined up, and it never feels too much, somehow they managed to balance it, and that is a feat not many directors can pull off.But also the music is masterfully composed, and fit every scene perfectly. And the costumes and props design are state of the art, everything looks and feels so right in this film, all the people involved has done an outstanding job.And i really have to give it to Josh Brolin. Thanos is easily the best villain i have seen in quite some time. He is a complex villain, that is so well portrayed i almost start rooting for him, and that is saying something come to think how many years i have grown to love the avengers and the guardians. This is also big thanks to the amazing cgi that just brings so much life into the character. I can understand his motivations, i can side with his thoughts, i both agree and i disagree at same time. Such a great character, easily the best MCU villain so far, and i had Loki as my favorite before him.At the end when Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Scarlett Witch, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Black Panther, Mantis, Bucky Barnes and many others are killed because he gets all the stones, i both felt a sense of pride for Thanos completing his mission, he truly is a determined badass. But at the same time i felt great sadness that so many of the characters that i loved, are dead.But MCU has killed characters before, which has been brought back to life, so i guess that will be the case here as well, as the next movie most likely will deal with time travel and fight Thanos in the future and the past. Dr.Strange gave up the time stone because of the 14.000.605 outcomes that he saw, only one lead to victory for the avengers, and giving up the stone was the beginning of the victory path. So even though this movie ended on a cliffhanger, it left enough hints that will be talked about for a whole year, and it will build the biggest hype in the history of cinema. So at the end of the day, this movie just delivers on so many levels, and it will make way for the rise of many new characters to enter the MCU, and finally take down Thanos and undo some of the damage he has done.It's quite amazing that this movie actually managed to live up to the hype, that should not even be possible when you think about it, but it did. The movie is absolutely amazing.I can't wait for Avengers 4.","

Putting all characters, realities and styles of these movies into one would probably result in a hidious thing, and that's what's wrong with this Avenger movie. There's too much of everything. More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.","

By the middle of the movie I found myself asking, where is it going and when is it going to get there.Three quarters in I found myself realizing it needed to be over. Every scene became a drag because that's what they did. On and on, one after another, with no endpoint. It was like the writer had a vision and then went blind.A simple plot that was easy to follow but it never seemed to develop. And you would think that in 2 1/2 hours you might get to know your characters a little. There was so much constant action and CGI, there was little or no time for that.If you enjoy being on the edge of your seat the entire time, this movie will do it for you because the action is never ending. A shining example of overdone CGI, lots of violence, and not enough time to tell if anyone can actually act.All of this nonsense to be left in the end with an incredible sense of loss. When I go to a superhero movie I want the superhero to win. In this case, The Avengers are nothing but a bunch of losers. And then there was the End Credits. They were giving credit to employees of the studios, like the CEO of Disney. WTF! This went on ad nauseum just like the movie itself. Don't waste your time waiting for the scene at the end, you'd be better off leaving the theater before the credits start to roll. 
In my opinion, this movie is an abysmal failure. Don't waste your 13 bucks on such trash.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","warren-87235","20 September 2018","Having missed this at the cinema, my other half and I finally got round to buying and watching it (in 3D). Wow... what a mess. I'm glad we didn't pay to see this at the cinema. I'm quite honestly amazed at how many good reviews it's been getting. It's disturbingly close to 'Last Jedi' level bad (but not quite... that would still take some work). There's no real plot to speak of, things just seem to happen 'because', any sense of logic or consistency goes out the window (And that's in comparison to most of the other Marvel movies, which are hardly that great in the logic stakes in the first place!), power levels constantly change to fit a particular scene, rather than match what has been established for characters previously, etc., etc..... To top it all off, after all the build up, Thanos turns out to be one of the least interesting Marvel villains, with face-palm-inducing 'woke' motivation. The only good thing I'll say, is that it manages what most Marvel movies usually manage: the character interaction and banter is fun for the most part, and amusing. Oh, and most of the effects are good (except for Banner pointlessly in the Hulk-buster).I understand and applaud the desire to try an 'Empire Strikes Back', but there are a few big differences (A story, for one). Empire works so well because our heroes get their posteriors kicked. They struggle tooth and nail to survive, and even when they do get a chance to fight they are soundly defeated. Infinity War falls flat, because the villain and his forces never feel particularly strong, and our heroes get repeated opportunities to defeat Thanos and simply don't take them because it would end the film early.To be honest, despite its very obvious flaws (and a certain top lip deserving second billing), I actually found Justice League more enjoyable. I genuinely began falling asleep at the end of Inifinity War and closed my eyes, just listening till the end, I was so bored. Such a shame and a wasted opportunity after the build up of so many movies.","

The ending is surprising, especially for an American movie, but besides this the movie neither offers scenography comparable with Star Wars or Avatar nor any unique special effects.There is no consistency in action, power distribution or whatsoever. One minute the same character can die from a fist hit, the other he survives an explosion of the whole planet. Once he travels the space barefoot, the other he dies from being sucked from the ship. The colorful light goes back and forth but the evil character doesnt use any of his powers most of the time just to prolong the boring fights.Watching this movie is just distubring and frustrating.","

It was part of my childhood and I was hyped on every single film when it was announced. So when Infinity War was announced it was something special. The final battle with our heroes against the ultimate villain.
And it didn't dissapoint.
I absolute loved it and the end shocked me.
I went out of the cinema and couldn't believe it.
For me it's the peak of the superhero genre alongside with Endgame.So now were in the Endgame...","

"Avengers: Infinity War","tyrantlizardthad","19 August 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film so powerful and good that instead of being crushed by the weight of its expectations, it lifted them up and launched them out into space. Packed with epic, intense action, fantastic character work, and a powerful ending, it doesn't get much better then this. It's especially remarkable when you remember just how much buildup there was to this film and how massive the expectations were, you would think it would be almost impossible to meet, but Infinity War does it so well it makes it look easy.The story is exhilarating, it moves at a brisk pace which really makes you feel the immense stakes and how urgent the situation is. Every single character is handled extremely well and are all in character. The film makes sure to pay attention to what spot they're in in their character journey since the last film each respective character was in and continues their development. It maintains continuity and brings every character together in a way that's organic and serves the story perfectly. Tony Stark finally gets to fight the thing he has been tormented by and preparing for years to fight, Steve Rogers and most of the other Avengers are fugitives of the law and thus are more rugged, Bruce Banner is still dealing with his conflict with the Hulk (continuing what was established Thor: Ragnarok), Thor is dealing with the grief of losing everything, manifesting in personal vengeance towards Thanos, and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the characterization of Thanos, one of the best villains in cinema since Darth Vader from Star Wars (which was the intent of the Russos, specifically saying that the wanted to make ""the next Darth Vader""). He is a ruthless, insane and narcissistic monster, but he still has honorable traits, respects his enemies, he has a very flawed perspective of how to save the universe but believes it whole-heartedly, and even a fatherly love towards Gamora. He's terrifying but also humanized, and it just works perfectly.The computer generated effects, especially those that brought Thanos to life, are perfect, as is the soundtrack. While MCU scores are typically regarded as forgettable, Alan Silvestri's score for Infinity War is anything but. The performances are impeccable as well, there's not a single unsatisfying or uneven performance. Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Benedict Bumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Zoe Salanda as Gamora in particular stick out to me and knock it out of the park.In conclusion, Infinity War is the best MCU film and one of the best films to have come out in the past 10 years, and I don't think you could ask for more. Infinity War (along with its sequel, Avengers: Endgame) isn't just a movie, it's an experience.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","pal05052003","29 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War manages to fix and upgrade superhero movies on many levels. First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","pink_floydilia","10 February 2019","So to preface this review, let me start by saying I'm a massive Marvel fan. I've lived, breathed, written and read Marvel since I was eight years old.
The Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie. And to the masses, it was good. So hats off to them for making a crowd pleasing movie. But to the others who like some sense and substance when they pay good money to see a movie, try harder.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Mr-Fusion","29 April 2018","High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, ""Infinity War"" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color. But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result. If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly. I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction. And that's about it.6/10","

"Avengers: Infinity War","comolgab","12 January 2019","Superheros are super because they do amazing things compared to the rest of us in this world. Here however, everyone does amazing things, always, for too long. It becomes boring. There is no normal world in the background to provide the contrast, it is one (long) fantasy tale. They're all ""super"" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still ""clunky"" and ""solid"". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character. Of course the movie is visually striking, but again, from the first scene to the last: I got used to the visuals after about 20 minutes, the rest felt to me like repetition.","

If you love these characters, were hooked on the previous movies, *don't.*
If you deal with anxiety, panic, depression, or anything else, *don't.*
This movie is not like the others, and honestly, does not show much screen time for most the characters.
It is much more violent and emotional than the previous films, but more than that, it is extremely disturbing.
Basically, if you feel obligated to view it for your favorite characters, just beware, there's not much screen time for them, so don't push yourself, or feel like you have to do it.
Also, I would definitely NOT take kids to see this, as the movie has a very dark and disturbing atmosphere to it.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","olgavalentovaov","30 April 2018","This movie has certainly made history. A film that has so much going on and still manages to be boring just has to be some sort of a record. I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there).
Also, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot.
And to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay. We don't need another character up in here, we really don't. And especially not Carl Manvers.
Not worth the cash, not worth the hype, not worth another word.","

This one is so action packed with all your favorite avengers. I had every emotion and feeling under the sun while watching this. I got goosebumps, I cried, I laughed, I got excited, I had anxiety, I was nervous, I was angry, I was happy. This movie will definitely give you whiplash in the emotion department. But it is by far the best avenger movie to date! And considering that it's their last one, I'm happy about that. But I'm extremely sad that this is the end of this MCU universe and I will miss all of them so very very much.

Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some ""plot holes"" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","25 April 2018","**Mild spoilers ahead**Avengers: Infinity War culminates 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU)'s world-building and makes a TREMENDOUS pay-off in this two-and-a-half hour action adventure epic that is part swashbuckler and part space-opera. The Russo Brothers deliver the screenplay of a lifetime from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely; and boy the two duos that have single-handedly shaped the MCU into what it is today. They direct a star-studded cast featuring the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Peter Dinklage, Benedict Cumberbatch, Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper, Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo. That's only PART of the ensemble cast this film has to offer. And the story; my god the story and scale of this movie: IT'S INCREDIBLE; and it's basically a full-fledged space opera now!For those of you who aren't ardent superhero nuts but passively love Spider-Man all the same (like I do), get this: SPIDER-MAN IS IN SPACE! From the ambitious union of characters built around 10 years of multi-billion-dollar filmmaking culminates in one of the ultimate cinematic experiences your hard-earned money can buy and be considered a well-earned investment all-round. Witty quips, Beatles references, a Flash Gordon quip from Peter Quill, it's just a great-great time at the movies.Infinity War is a space-opera with superheroes; and it's comparable to the likes of The Star Wars Trilogy, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and, (heck, maybe even) The Dark Knight Trilogy. This is cinema bursting at the seams; but it's GOOD bursting as opposed to muddled bursting (Suicide Squad is one such misfire).MARVEL; you've made quite the pay-off this time. Keep it up!","

Not to talk about stupid character decisions that completely change the plot...It takes away from the soul of the story which becomes simple, forced and artificial.SPOILER:Just one example for abilities (but the movie is full of it): in one scene Thanos beats the pulp out of Hulk, but in the rest of the movie all the other heroes receive punches from him like it's nothing.And one example of stupidity: Quill becomes responsible for the grim ending by saving Thanos in the last second, as Thanos was on the verge of being stripped of its powers.I expected more...","

"Avengers: Infinity War","oliverdimitri","26 April 2018","Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. 
So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). 
Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. 
And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. 
I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","nicar127","13 May 2018","Kill kill kill. Death. That's what this movie is about. To their credit, the actors in this film were all great, despite each being given minimal screen time, with near zero character development. There are just too many characters and angles, each with the same ultimatum: KILL. (They are all trying to kill the villain Thanos, of course, but it's still Kill Kill Kill!)I never felt any passion for any of them until Gamora was thrown to her death by her POS step dad Thanos. When we see movies we want to feel the passion of the characters we are watching. None existed until this moment. My favorite character in this film is Peter Quill. Way to go Chris Pratt. He brought depth and passion, sorrow and love, to his role. He is the stand out in this film. I cried when he cried. I was pissed off when he was pissed off. Peter Quill / Star Lord was the sole representative of human emotion in this film. And he did it well.On the technical note, Thanos just looks like a cartoon character.
(No offense, Josh Brolin, you were GREAT as Thanos!!)
CGI always looks fake. I watched the entire movie imagining the ""green screen"" behind all of them. In a few years, actors won't be needed at all.Iron Man could have just gotten a huge eraser to erase Thanos The Cartoon.

"Avengers: Infinity War","dezsokekovacs","28 April 2018","If you like to watch for 2.5 hours how your heroes get beaten and even killed then this movie is for you, otherwise it will not entertain you. 
At the beginning Thanos has only one Infinity Stone but at the end he has all the stones and therefore he snap his fingers, half of the population dies (Avengers included) and ... THE END!
This means that there are 5 fights for the 5 stones and Thanos wins all the fights by beating and/or killing the Avengers.All MCU movies structures are the same. They are split in 2 parts: in the first half the heroes get beaten and the villain wins all, but when all hope is gone it start the second half when the heroes recover from their wounds and they win (almost every time) with a big ""idiotic"" bam.
The Avengers: Infinity War is the first half. I think it will be entertaining to watch it when the Avengers 4 will come out (just like The fellowship of the ring + The two tower). It's very likely that in Avengers 4 they will use the time stone to reverse the time to resurrect the dead Avengers. Or maybe another stone (honestly I don't really know what they can do) but the resurrection is for sure.Bottom line: this movie is watchable if you see it only once. But to watch several times how your heroes get killed means that you need therapy.PS: When Dr. Strange looked into the future to find a positive solution, he found only ONE from millions of possibilities and they didn't used it. Why? Or they used it but Strange didn't saw in the future that Peter Quill is coming?","

"Avengers: Infinity War","adeckofcards","25 July 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level.
In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second.
It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop.
'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","yrwann","13 June 2018","Because guess what, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a straight up porn for any fan of cinématography. The plot is as simple, formulaic and stupid as it can get. There is a huge amount of holes, henny. The chemistry between actors (hence acting) is non-existent. All that we get - is a portion of idiotic choices just to excuse the upcoming ""ACTION"". Ye, baby, gimme more... These sweet fireworks and a talking piece of purple CGI is all I need. These ""Avengers"" might be mentally disabled: can't think OR use abilities OR communicate with each other. Well, at least they succeeded at jabbing one another with some jokes (a benevolent 1 star for this).","

It seemed a very rushed story involving too many actors and super heros. I do like super hero movies and do enjoy a good fantasy, but this was not it.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","ocr-94520","10 May 2018","It totally wasn't how i expected it to be. It's just a silly film with only action. Many cringy dialogues and dumb moments ruined the film. I felt really bad when yondu died in GOTG 2 but in this film never felt anything for anyone. So many died but i don't know why this film was in a rush and that's why their death didn't made me feel bad for them. They should have increased the runtime of the film. One of the worst thing is characters were not balanced. Captain america hardly had any dialogue. Hulk was shown only for 30 seconds in the entire film. There were many ways to stop thanos but hey he should look badass so let's make heroes dumb. Cgi was okay but in many places it looked cartoon-ish. In one scene it looked like Mark ruffalo's face is pasted on hulk buster. The film is full of plot holes.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Shakor77","18 July 2018","To a certain degree most super hero movies are pointless as they are mainly about beings with super powers and in flamboyant costumes duking it out at each other. And, seeing as I grew up reading super-hero comics, that is just fine.However, without getting into any spoilers, this movie could have ended the first minute as the end-result would have been the same as watching the whole thing for 2+ hours. So I guess you could say that this game was a setup for the next Avengers movie, which seems to have become the norm these days.But disregarding that, there are a number of other weak points in this movie such as:Hulk was a massive disappointment and made his weakest contribution so far of any Avengers movie. And it was never explained why.Vision was another disappointment as apparently the Black Widow, who has no super powers, could hold her own against someone who was mopping the floor with Vision.Some young girl in Wakanda, who I never heard of in the comics, is apparently more intelligent than both Bruce Banner and Tony Stark as she came up with a solution, in about 5 minutes after been presented with the problem, that those other two hyper-intelligent people could not come up with. I suppose that is because of feminism?Loki made a very uncharacteristic choice which quickly made him irrelevant in this movie. Why then even have him in the movie to begin with?Dr Strange, who was pretty good in the movie, didn't seem to stand much of a chance against a Thanos henchman but apparently could go toe to toe with Thanos himself?Thor was easily swept aside by Thanos, in the beginning, yet by the end seemed to be the only one who could actually defeat Thanos, just because he had a weapon. Yet in Thor: Ragnarok Odin suggested that Thor, was more powerful than Odin and did not need any weapons as he said: Are you Thor: son of Hammers? I could go on and on but this is basically a very nice action movie with some great performances from actors such as Josh Brolin as Thanos. But don't think too deeply about it as it is just an action movie and not much more.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","aj_gr8","2 May 2018","I mean I don't get it why this movie came in the top 250 movies in IMDb. I am not saying that this is a bad movie but the best super hero movie ever? People have just have just made up their minds that it's avengers so it must be a very good movie. The pervious avengers movie were better than this one. In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","three_dead_crows","5 May 2018","In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. 
 
The day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel. After watching this movie I feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure Peter Quill is, just like they did with Danny Rand in the defenders.","

So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!","

"Avengers: Infinity War","DaytonaBob","17 January 2019","The movie was mostly a lot of CGI and a lot more fighting. ALL neat to watch. BUT the idiocy of believing there are a handful of little stones that control the ENTIRE UNIVERSE? All the neat outer space scenes and strange alien landscapes all of that.BUT to say he would be able to control the ENTIRE Universe?I am sorry but that is beyond ridiculous.I am huge Marvel fan and can actually say I have been reading Marvel since FF#4. And at one time had almost every single issue of the comics they put out until the mid 70s. They were great fun.This movie on the other hand is silly. One person with a handful of stones controls the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.Do the writers at Marvel et al have any clue as to the size of the universe and that is just what we have been able to see? The bazillions and gazillions of GALAXIES, the number of planets would be a ONE followed by millions of zeros. The amount of beings, and all sorts of life forms would be a One followed by a number of zeros so large it is unfathomable.I would have bought say, the galaxy. But this stupidity of the entire universe was just that.Seriously lame. Silly and beyond any sense of rational thought. YES it is comics and just a movie but the primary belief in how to enjoy a movie is the SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Sorry, NO. And on top of that it all centered around a small planet in one of the arms of the Milky Way closer to the edge of the end of the arm than otherwise. Really? HOW did we get so lucky in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.We are supposed to believe the Thanos character would have the ability to wipe out half of that? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAI love Marvel but this should have been an insult to anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together. Oh well I hope we don't get a conclusion that reminds me of an old Saturday Morning serial of Jungle Jim where at the end of the episode where we had to come back next Saturday to that theater to find out how he got out of the predicament of being caught in a HOLE half way done and below him were lions ready to tear him apart and above him were natives ready to rip him apart and cook him.So how did he get out of it? Well Next Saturday's episode started with the voice over stating: ""After Jungle Jim got out of his last trap he headed towards the nearest village"" Seriously that is how they did it.So are we going to get either this was an alternate universe?
A dream that when one of them gets out of the shower his wife says I had the strangest dream?
Or .....? ""Thanos you bad boy, Where have you been? Your father and I have been looking all over dozens of universes. Now you put things right or you are going to get such a paddling when we get back to home!""Thanos: ""Aw gee mom you never let me have any fun""This will be the only interesting part is what silliness they use to restore the universe to its natural order minus some nutjob like Thanos.Gods above and below that was an awful movie but it was cool to see all the Superheroes in one movie.. So glad I could watch it at home and fast forward through all the fighting.BUT ya gotta hand it to the fanboys who have posted it was the greatest cinematic effort in the history of the world. And the one guy who said anyone who says differently then IMDB should immediately pull the review and probably publicly flog the person who wrote it.","

You could really empathize with the characters and feel the urgency and dread as time ticked away.The MCU was a powerhouse before this film, and the film cemented its place in pop culture. Even if you haven't seen the movie, you've likely heard of and know what film is being referenced when someone says, ""the snap.""Ensemble pieces really hinge on the chemistry between the cast, and everyone here played so well with each other's characters, it was a real treat to watch.

"Avengers: Infinity War","myema77","17 May 2018","Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates.
Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find?
You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered:
Slick action and stunning visuals.
The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here. Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond.With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie.
The story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing.
(The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner)
The supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe.
 On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn.
Thano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing! Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life.As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this. Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie?
Opinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie.Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme.2 stars, one for Tom Holland and the other for Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Lewis_Heather787","28 April 2018","What did I just watch???? To be honest I don't think I can process everything and I'm not such if that is a bad thing or a good thing. To get it out there straight away I'm not a die hard fan of these films actually if anything I've losing more and more interest in the MCU as its gone on. I'm not quite sure why, just a lot of them are not for me but I can see why general audience love them, they are vey appealing. Positives.The Russo brothers were given an almost impossible task and that was to bring together a huge amount of characters in one film and tell a cohesive story that works. For the most part I think they have achieved that, the directing of the film is faultless and is a real achievement considering the number of things that could go wrong with a film like this. Personally though I would put it behind ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"" for the Russo's , those films have less problems than this one.The cast for the most part is good, I cant mention them all because there are so many however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly and I'm really shocked to be saying this, the best character in the film for me is Doctor Strange. Now I personally didn't like the character in he is own film, but thats another story, in this film he is the heart and plays an important role. Acting from Cumberbatch is obviously going to be great, but I was blown away by how good he really was. There is a fantastic fight scene between him and Thanos on his own, wow. The other standout is Thor, Hemsworth again knocks it out of the park and has really cool scenes towards the end of the film which are worth the wait. The others are all really good as well for the most part, but those two definitely stood above the rest. NegativesThis is where this review gets a unhelpful mark because it goes against the consensus of this film. For me there are four main negatives film the film, ok bare with me. Firstly its the same old same old problem I personally have with the MCU and that is the dreaded humour. Extremely cringeworthy at times and once again far to much of it especially with the Guardians, which also really don't like. I know Im in the minority on this, and I have no problem in people thinking this is the best part of the film its just not for me. 
The humour of the film links to the next negative and that is the tone of the film, which to say the least is all over the place. One second we have cringeworthy jokes and the next second its all trying to be serious. I think the Russo's really struggled with this element of the film because the humour and jokes undermine the seriousness. Do one or the other??
The third negative is the end which is a complete joke right? The end was looking at first glance to be a fantastic emotional punch and shocking end to some characters. However instead they decide to ""kill"" off characters that we pretty much know for the most part will be back for the next Avengers film next year. Marvel have already announced sequels and other solo films for characters like Black Panther, Spiderman and maybe even Doctor Strange. So their deaths are meaningless and carry no weight, brings up the question what is the point in the whole film really when we know a reasonable amount of it is going to be reversed in the next film.(I could be wrong)
The final small negative is the length of the film which is far too long, the film does definitely drag in some parts.Overall the film is probably just about good enough for 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, when the film is good it is very enjoyable and good to watch however I have my reservations. They are mainly my own fault and I'm definitely in the minority when it comes to them. However I'm wondering whether even the most die hard fan is not a little disappointed with this film like hasn't this been 10 years in the making. Finally if you like these types of films you will absolutely love it however if your not to bothered like me then you might not enjoy it as much.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Vartiainen","21 June 2018","Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something.So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring.The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more.Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending... We will be talking about that ending for decades to come.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","CubsandCulture","12 December 2018","Everything about this movie was portrayed as bigger and more. Bigger Action! More heroes! The problem with that eventually more becomes less and the story collapses under its own weight. That happens here but not as much as I expected. The final film is coherent so there's that. It is also largely fun. There's that too. However, there is still too many sequence of the same stuff (get the stone!) and a lot of the film is very unwilling to play with the world it has set-up. Of note Dr. Strange and Thanos (post reality stone especially) are far too punchy. You can change the fabric of reality. Why do you insist on just punching people?A film like this lives, or this case disappoints on its villain. Thanos is OK as a villain. He is played well by Brolin. How he is written leaves much to be desired. His radical environmentalism simply doesn't connect with anything that is actually happening in the world today. It makes the film feel insular and escapist in the wrong way. Moreover, the logic of the character requires him to be either a eugenicist or a ""eat the rich"" radical; the screenplay does neither. The writers try to split the different by applying the big moment randomly. (but somehow random means 1/2 of each significant couple among the heroes). It simply doesn't work. It is not chilling. It is not human. It is silly.The deaths (""deaths"") are overdone. I simply do not believe Disney is going kill off a bunch of Golden Geese. It simply doesn't have any emotional weight because too many characters that have sequels in the works ""die."" The ending only gets a hearty chuckle from me.This film is fun. It moves and most of the action is good. But it is shallow, hollow and expects us to forget how capitalism works.","

The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is.
Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie.

I just hated in how it ended the death of Tony Stark (aka Iron Man). Now for me, I wasn't much of a Robert Downey Jr. Up until his role as Iron Man, loved the way he brought some intelligence to the role of Tony Stark as well as humor to. I just hated that they had to kill him off.Maybe Dr. Strange can go back to that moment and change the coarse of history and still keep the ending the same, by allowing Tony Stark to live but still killing off Thanos...hmm, interesting concept, HEY MARVEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Brandon_Walker_Robinson","10 June 2018","I know I'm extremely late to the party, but I waited for a time to sync up and see it with a friend (we both have too many obligations in the education realm), plus I had to see Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok beforehand.Now before I leave any impressions, know that my experience was dampened by students with a moronic goal of sabotage by deciding to blurt out anything about the film they knew that I wouldn't want to know. I mean... what can I do to them in retaliation? Fail them? Strike them down with the hammer of Thor? Nothing, they're untouchable and they know it. It's sad, and I thought I've taught them to be better than that. Unfortunately, that select few is out there and always will be. I've waited nearly thirty years of my life for a film of this impactful magnitude to come out in its respectful genre, and individuals half of my age decide to play the card of indecency upon me and essentially impede on the level of my viewing experience.All that being said... it was a very good film, even better than I liked it (the problem was the spoilers). In fact, if I were to list negatives for this film, it would really just be all in one lump-sum bullet point regarding the lack of grounded material: a lot of space related stuff, nanotechnology (and I really don't like the Iron Spider compared to regular ol' Spider-Man), whims of inexplicable magic sources, levels of seemingly unbeatable friends and foes where I don't understand the devastation of a punch or explosion onto the individual taking the blow, and the recurring MCU element of death not necessarily being a finality for characters' ends.Conversely, there were many things that I really appreciated about the film. The first thing I would like to mention was the balance of everything, starting with the balance of characters and their moments. I thought this was going to be a massive issue going into this film, where it would just be one endless action battle and people wouldn't be able to serve their parts correctly, or they would only serve aspects as a moment of convenience to further the plot. Instead, where everyone was at during any moment seemed very natural to the overall MCU progression of items, and interactions that were had (on top of some that have yet to occur, lying in wait for the fourth Avengers film) were nicely played out. Villain encounters even appeared late in the film, which is kind of nice so that the legend looms larger as the movie goes on instead of playing beats such as: ""We need three fights between hero and villain, so let's spread them out."" Even characters who are physically inferior weren't just suitably matched up with other characters of that nature, and instead they found a way to possibly hold their own or team up to make things equal enough so that the fights could be anywhere with anyone. None of this works just in script alone; this was done by the hands of great directing. The Russo Bros have found a way to serve this great kind of balance for two straight films, though in Civil War it really felt a little more like: ""Let's force the issue and get everyone on screen at once, even in a bit of a friendlier brawl."" Admittedly some characters miss the boat of even appearing in the film, but it was few and far between, and they are explained away where frankly it worked just fine.Another great form of balance was in the light versus dark emotional moments. I have been on Marvel for having too many lighthearted moments in their films, or really too much levity for the sake of entertaining the crowd on their first viewing of a film. They really pushed the envelope with Thor: Ragnarok, and honestly I was not appreciative of it. They needed to find a way to strike the right balance of when to say what and what surface level of comedy they need to inject during the characters given the moments, but most importantly every light moment needs to be balanced with a dark moment for emotions to hit the right heartstrings. Infinity War does exactly that. I wasn't eye-rolling when they injected humor, and only one or two comedic bits were out of place for the moment they were in. That is a fair price to pay for the overall structure. They had enough characters to find those moments with in the 160-minute running time, and for once they didn't have the villain(s) either be demoted to that same level of yuck-yucks nor did they subject them to another character's comedic relief as a way to actually victimize them.This is a great time to transition to this film's villain: Thanos. I have had my quips with MCU villains being rather underserved in scope compared to that of the larger picture at play, like where they may be more of a pawn so the rest of the chessboard could do its thing. Thanos, however, appears as the king of this universe's chessboard. He was the main character in this film, and probably had the most screen time. He was not just a villain seeking ultimate domination of everything for the sake of it, he has his own goals and purposes in an attempt to restore a harmonious balance (there is that world again) for all species. It was not only believable, but it was also sympathetic. He shows remorse for his (attempted) actions, he shows mercy to those who beg for it so long as they aid in furthering his cause, and he speaks with a level head in a way that if we haven't already had eighteen other MCU films liking our heroes so much that we would actually root for the bad guy here. Definitely the best served comic book villain in a decade, if not right alongside the Joker for 'overall' status. Granted, Heath Ledger has given us the performance of a lifetime, though that character is very one-dimensional (and really good at that dimension, no doubt). Thanos really surprised me that he was more than just a large purple alien wanting ""MOAR.""I want to give the directors credit for making an extremely long running time feel extremely short. I don't know if I'm sitting here saying that I'd like to watch a whole 'nother hour of the film, but they hit the right beats and paced it so evenly that they really made time fly by in a manner that other films really can't speak for in the same vein. For all the movies I own on Blu-ray, I sometimes stop short of watching something that runs this long because I tell myself: ""This is a long film man, you are going to be devoting a lot of time to this."" I don't think I'll be saying that about Infinity War. If I were to show this to a friend who hadn't seen it yet, I wouldn't be warning them about the duration of it nor would I fear they would be looking at their watch every fifteen minutes wondering when it would end. The more you get into the film, the more you lean forward on the edge of your seat. Yes, sometimes they do cut away from characters to get to others because they have to, but you never forget your place where others are at and you aren't dismayed at the next grouping's story line. It all worked so very, very well.I'll cap this off with one thing that wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be, and it was in the movie's action. There was nothing wrong with it, but outside of some last-act battles I wasn't ever really wowed by anything either. All visual effects were top-notch, though (ehem, Ragarok was not good here too). I do think I'm putting this on a relative scale though, because it's interesting that I say that looking back at the whole picture that I think the moments outside of the action were actually better than the action points themselves, not in terms of entertainment but just in overall value. That's a good thing too, so now you're not just sitting around waiting to be getting your money's worth again. This jumps back to how the film's length is not a concern. No action scene overstays its welcome either, or it has enough dynamic elements and cross-cutting that it fits properly (again, jumping back to Civil War, that airport scene was just way too contrived... this doesn't have that). Age of Ultron was much more of a popcorn flick for me that I really do enjoy, and The Avengers has all of its lasting appeal in the final third of the film when they all assemble together, so I think I can say this one is the most consistently put together.Overall, I would say that my experience was definitely a great one and it is likely hitting inside my Top 3 of all the MCU films (The Winter Soldier still wins). I'm not ready to officially rank it just yet and I still have a lot of questions about what I saw in this one, but again that's a good thing about this film's natural depth where I'll have to watch it more than once to understand and appreciate those items. I really think the thing that brings this movie down a notch was my experience because of spoilers beforehand, and I didn't want to believe many of them to be true but unfortunately many were. This is a movie that I even avoided watching trailers for. Any knowledge about an event I am already interested in does not help ramp up the hype by me learning more about it. Shame on them for doing that to my theatrical viewing, but thankfully this film did not only rely on its spoiler-bound moments to be as good as it was. It was very ambitious, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next because I really have no idea where they want to go from here.","

It also spent too much time focusing on the villain and his rationalizations for genocide. I found myself wondering if such indulgences would seem inappropriate to dwell on for a real mass murderer like Rudolf Hoess, why is it appropriate dramatically for Thanos? 
Answer: It's not. This film was easily the worst Marvel film I've seen.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","viithtrump","26 May 2018","Marvel's biggest issue in my opinion is that there is just too much to take from comics, as it is a giant cluster mess. There is so many marvel characters now that some are just not that great and they shouldn't exist. Black panther is a yawn, and same with the second iron man (pure stupid, along with a 3rd in Banner? Are you kidding me right now?) and new younger spiderboy (even more dumb), which I feel shouldn't be in this series. Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful. I really think they are headed for clash with like Galactus and other bigger enemies and when Fox is bought out by Disney it will lead to the Xmen joining too, gets bigger and worse. Good luck.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","highmarksreviews","29 April 2018","""Avengers"": Infinity War"" is an epic unlike any other. It's a reminder of how far the MCU has come in 10 years and this movie capitalises on its bloated, but beloved cast to draw you in. Every character gets their own moment to shine a little, the dizzying, vibrant comic book action is satisfying and defies conventions. While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell. For really the first time, the consequences are felt and resonate long after the credits roll. non-stop comic book action and surprising emotional depth. While a little uneven at times, its beloved cast, outstanding villain and sheer scope never underwhelm and the end product is something truly epic.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","Pjtaylor-96-138044","29 April 2018","'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10","

"Avengers: Infinity War","danjstanley","6 May 2018","I don't typically write reviews; however, someone needed to balance out the over the top love for this bad plotted film with way too many stars. For me, it all comes down to this question:
""Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?"" The answer is NO! 
I know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. 
Then, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","AdrenalinDragon","26 April 2018","I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too.I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to 
focus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it. The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations.9.5/10","

"Avengers: Infinity War","arthuradam","5 May 2018","If I am to get to the point, the movie was noisy audibly and visually. It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. 
There's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. 
Too much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other.
Wakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now.
Anyhow, there are some good parts in the movie, but it's rushed and just awful. I preferred Justice League as a movie; the pacing was a lot better.","

Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous.Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Overall Infinity War does offer much different occurrences, a lot if characters and a lot going on.Though one can't help feel that it wasn't as great as advertised.

"Avengers: Infinity War","Film_star","27 April 2018","I have rated this 5 stars, predominantly because I think 9s and 10s should be provinces reserved for truly great movies. This is an entertaining one, which kept me interested for most of its overlong running time, but which won't leave me with much lingering sense of a tangible movie - it felt like a solid episode in a series I'm binge-watching, but I'll struggle to treasure many specifics of this movie from a line-up of Marvel titles.There are a ridiculous number of characters in this; the film is using that as its ""event"" selling point, but in truth it was the factor which made me most apprehensive before watching it. To the filmmakers' credit, the juggling of storylines and superheroes (and their endless sidekicks and sub-teams) was almost impressive - it never felt as though many were shoehorned too awkwardly into the forward trajectory of the overall narrative, though some characters - including leading players like Spider-Man and Black Widow - inevitably get shortchanged.The series' most rewatchable movies - for me Avengers, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Ragnarok and Black Panther - all have something compelling that feels unique to them. I'm not sure this has a unique selling point beyond a huge cast jostling for billing position on the poster, but whilst it plods along it's perfectly decent, and fans of the franchise will likely lap it up.At the time of writing, the film is ranked number 10 on the IMDb list of the Top 250 movies OF ALL TIME. I'm certain it will plummet once the general public start to supersede the fanboy rush, but this kind of kneejerk over-ranking in the context of cinematic history is a nonsense.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","austin0731","25 April 2018","Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody.Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment.Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable. But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.","

Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story. 'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course!But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc.That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure!Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch! Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts.On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","coreyjdenford","26 April 2018","This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free***** (5/5)IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock. Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test. Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron ""I'll do it myself"" and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin. How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage. Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them?Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait. VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","frank_kneepkens","3 August 2018","Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that ""I don't understand"" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!","

You will cry from pleasure, you will cry from epicness and you will definitely cry from heartbreaking scenes. Ten years of building, leading to this MASTERPIECE!I guess you want to know something about Thanos. Well, he is the ultimate villain, I mean he is menacing. Every speech that he got, gives you chills, his movements, his motivation, hands down the best villain!The interactions between the different fractions of heroes is magnificent. The first time you see Guardians and Thor, Iron Man and Guardians, Strange and Spidey it's just awesome! The chemistry between them is incredible.The story is told incredibly. The waiting for this movie, the hype, everything is worth it. Actions scenes especially some....are jaw dropping, you gonna shake your head and you will be not able to stay on your seat calm. The music combined with the scenes, like I said MASTERPIECE...this movie is out of this world.Russo Brothers just strike again! The visuals are so well done too. There is no way to catch every single detail on the first viewing, also the movie deserves multiple viewings again and again and again...and I'm not even joking.On purpose I do not want to give you absolute any spoilers. I want you to enjoy the movie by yourself. I believe any real fan will be happy with the result of ten years gradation and like me, will got no words.","

"Avengers: Infinity War","jhalcollege","3 June 2018","In linear algebra, a matrix is said to be rank deficient if one of its rows or columns can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows or columns. In layman's terms, this particular part adds nothing new to the overall picture, it just uses information that is already present.This happens to be the defining characteristic of Infinity War, there's nothing new here. What there is is a lot of action, a lot of CGI, and lots of bad jokes with a few okay ones tossed in the mix (exactly what Marvel has been doing for ten years).The film makes a half decent effort to distinguish arch-villian Thanos from the rest of the baddies, and its kind of succeeds on a minimal level. But in the end, he's just another world conquering fiend who's bigger and stronger than everyone else (Steppenwolf from Justice League?) who is set off to collect some arbitrary artifacts.Another issue is comes as a side effect of putting so many established characters in. Take Captain American for example, a character whose driven by morals, and whose films are relatively serious, and the Guardians of the Galaxy (about as serious as Looney Tunes). They've done fine on their own, but put them in the same scene and it just doesn't work. At this point, if you're not sick and tired of Avenger's Universe, then good for you. But for the rest of us, one thing's for sure, haters are definitely going to hate this one.(If you're not familiar with the IMDb rating formula, you should check it out. While Infinity War rests at an 8.8 at the time of this writing, it will drop reasonably over time as more casual viewers watch the film, and rate it the four or five it deserves.)","

His character is what we in the gaming world would call OP (Over Powered). How does destroying 50% of all life in the universe bring balance? The whole blasted plot was based on that silly premise! I am pretty sure I need to blame some obscure writers at Marvel for this ridiculous plot and character. The entire movie makes a mockery of science and even science fiction. Spoiler: The idea that you could collect 6 stones (which were created during the Big bang) and then snap your fingers to wipe out 1/2 of all life EVERYWHERE in the known (and probably unknown as well) universe takes witchcraft, sorcery and the supernatural to levels beyond anything within reason. Now where do you go Disney? You gave us a worst case scenario and any future villains will be mild by comparison. As with Thor Ragnarok you destroyed a future where Marvel has skipped over many villians and leapfrogged to the top, leaving a barren wasteland for future enemies to ""marvel"" at.","

In less than a minute he knocks Hulk out! ""We have a Hulk"" is so meaningless right now. Then Banner is forced into and kept in an iron man suit. Agrhhhh! Thanos is so hyped that he shouldn't be beaten even in part 5. How is it that Dr Strange never used the time stone? Then Iron Man and Spiderman (humans) are able to breathe freely on Titan?Also annoying, Vision is carried about like a baby, limp and powerless. You just wonder whether it's the same vision that was so powerful in Civil War and could walk through walls. Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting the Avengers to win Thanos in this part since it's a 2-part movie but let's put it this way; the avengers were humiliated!

"Avengers: Infinity War","classicsoncall","5 September 2018","Compared to the first two Avengers movies, I've rated this one a solid '9' against a pair of '7's' for the other two. The prequels felt more like getting the most out of all the destruction that the super-heroes could inflict on their cosmic adversaries. That formula's still at work here but it seemed a lot fresher with the team-up between The Guardians and The Avengers, while Thanos (Josh Brolin) brought a decidedly different dimension to his role as an intergalactic enforcer. Some might even call his mission honorable, in as much as he wants to save the universe with his philosophy that ""If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist"". Fresh on the heels of ""Thor:Ragnarok"", the Marvel and Disney folks do well here to keep the humor in place while dramatic events unfold throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth)/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) dynamic was especially played well, and it was a hoot to see Thor accept Rabbit's, er..., Rocket's (voiced by Bradley Cooper) claim as captain of the Guardians. Where the film loses a point for me has to do with the inconsistency with some of the principal characters. Depending on which prior movie you care to cite, Thor and Doctor Strange have been positioned as the most powerful entities in the Marvel universe. However here, they were dispatched rather handily in the early going by Thanos's minions. There's also the quite literal overkill that occurs near the end of the story with the disintegration of heroes like Black Panther, Doc Strange and Spidey, along with the entire Guardian team. You know they have to make a come back in the follow up sequel(s), so it seemed like an almost cheap attempt to elicit pathos from the audience. By my count, at least fourteen Marvel characters met their demise in the story if you include Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner in the after credits scene.Once again, and I can't help it, but kudos to Stan Lee, Marvel comic writer and originator of many of these characters, for his bus driver cameo near the beginning of the picture. His one line was particularly apropos: ""What's the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?""And oh yes, don't want to forget this little tidbit. There have been any number of movies with scenes set in New York City in which the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are in prominent view prior to the events of 9/11, but in this flick, there's a quick glimpse offered of the new One World Trade Center rising from the city skyline. I thought that was very cool, and even better that it wasn't in the path of the New York City dust up.","

There is an audience (and a massive one willing to pay big bucks and stand in long lines ) who champion all of the Marvel Comics films. AVANGERS INFINITY WAR is no exception. At over two and a half hours even the huge cast of gifted actors - at their bet when being funny - explode, blow up things, zoom into outer space for a mission to find Thanos who goal is to rule the universe by obtaining all the funky jewels for his glove - all seem to wear thin from the plodding 'plot' and turn to dust. The true 'stars' of this huge effort are f course the CGI team - the special effects are truly spectacular, at least for the first hour. The characters don't get much time to develop but the actors assigned to the strange roles make the Avengers and their enemies entertaining. The 'plot'? 'As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.'Cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Vin Diesel, Benecio Del Toro, Chris Pratt, William Hurt, Josh Brolin, Gweneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper etc etc etc.

It's still one of the best superhero movies ever made. Thanos had made brief appearances in literally three other Marvel movies and we finally got a film focusing on him. Even at the ending credits, it says that Thanos will return and not the Avengers! The plot's pretty standard with the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians Of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from collecting all the Infinity Gems making him the most powerful being in the Universe. The biggest part of this movie is the ending in which...they actually fail.Yep, Thanos gets everything he wants and immediately gains his goal of wanting to kill half the people in the entire Universe! There possibly hasn't been a movie with more deaths of named characters. This was in fact something that happened in the comics, but it seemed so crazy I had no idea it would actually happen here! It's a shame that we don't get to see all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy in the same place at the same time. I believe this is the longest Marvel movie ever made. It certainly didn't seem like it as the pacing was so great!They said this movie would be darker, but it seemed to have a lot of jokes at first. Then came the ending and even the ending credits seemed gloomy. We finally get to see Loki kick the bucket. It's great that we have the characters reference all of their losses. It's just one awesome action scene after another. Unlike ""Transformers"" these ones are beautiful looking and creative. ****","

Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe.Try to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing.

"Avengers: Infinity War","bgsmall","19 May 2018","Caveats on this review are; I'm no especial fan of comic book storylines made into films, my primary reason for attending was to take my children for their entertainment (not mine).As you might expect from a comic book rendering; the central plot of revolves around Thanos (the 'baddie') intent on decimating humanity by ~50% of it's current number to 'restore balance' to an over-crowded universe that has dwinding supplies and no means to support the ever growing populus. Taking that and the film at face value - this is a bizzare and macarbe storyline that hurtles between fight scenes without any character development or sub-plot development whatsoever (O.K, that's a little unfair - but not much). That's maybe my own fault - as I've not seen the other (precedent) movies in this series. However, as entertainment value goes, it's a little poor and in retrospect I would not have taken my children to see it.Now, taking the central plot as something 'other' than just fantasy I have a couple of questions / statements:
1. Is the storyline in anyway faithful to what was written in the comic book storylines?
2. Who signed off on the budget of this movie? - I'm guessing it cost $$$$$$$ (that's seven, each representing a 10-fold increase in magnitude) at least.
3. Whoever (individual or committee) did sign off on this budget, then also implicitly (or maybe explicitly) approved the premise of the central plot.
4. Given that Hollywood has been used historically to influence audiences and therefore by extrapolation (largely developed world) populations via it's 'messages' (propaganda) is this warning or threat? 
5. I don't believe that a movie of such an incredible budget is signed off without having an ulterior motive (usually paving the way for later films and more money) - and unless I've missed something - they just trashed the franchise??Just because I'm paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get me.","

My how times have changed.For me, the movie was all over the place, jumping from earth, to a distant planet, etc. Yes, the war extends across the galaxy, that much is understood, but too many cross stories, and the entire former Avengers team isn't even together. It does set up the 2nd half that comes out in 2019 which looks lie there will be a head-on face-to-face again with two of the Avengers that split apart, especially since, well, you know why.All in all, the CGI graphics were excellent. Very top notch. But, a movie can only look so great before it falls under it's own weight, and I'm sorry, but AIW does just that. Editing is sub-par, there are some good one-liners, but I had just watched Ant Man and the Wasp just before this at home and that was a great movie for me. Funny, hilarious and action packed. This, so-so. Disney is trying way too hard here. Need to get back to reality and ground this series back to how it started.I dare say that AIW is the Marvel Universe's ""The Last Jedi"". Pretty to look at, but empty everywhere else.","

There are some humorous dialogues that are funny, which makes the movie deserve my second star. The effects are of course top notch, and one has to commend the technical aspect. 
 
Other than that, there is no logic whatsoever in the movie. Every exaggeration from the past has now been multiplied by a thousand. The plot could be summarized in a couple lines, with room to spare.

A roller coaster ride of adventure I enjoyed it every minute and went out the theaters wanting to see more. So expect me to go see it again before it end its run.! No super hero movie has ever come close to what people at Marvel are doing at the moment. And Avengers Infinity War said that furthermore this movie soared through my expectations. The visual was spectacular the action was explosive and satisfying. The Russo's have crafted Something truly remarkable and freshness that you'd never expect. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing narrative possibilities that strech in any direction. On the strength of this outing, that's Something to be anticipated, rather than feared.I highly recomend everyone to go see it",NA
"Avengers: Infinity War","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","27 April 2018","Thanos(Brolin, giving us a layered villain, the best in recent years) has...*finally*... started to gather the Infinity Gems. If he gets all six he can wipe out half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. Will our heroes be able to stop him and his ""Children""?The hype for this was unreal. Many say that it couldn't live up to it. And I realise that a lot don't, and won't(as it premieres around the world), think it did. For my money(and they'll keep getting them as long as they keep making them this good), it delivered, and then some. Obviously, with so many major characters, they cannot possibly all get a lot of screentime. You could criticise their decision to include so many. Honestly, you're free to think so, but this is not a movie for you. Which is fine. I don't doubt that you love flicks that aren't for me. This is a cinematic version of an event comic, not decreased in scope as most of the adaptations of those stories are, something I've been waiting for for 20 years to be done right. So rather than complain about something that couldn't be helped, let's look at whether it's satisfying. Personally, I absolutely think so. I've loved most of these since I first saw these versions of them, and I felt that they were all featured to the right extent. Every single one of them makes an impact, most get arcs, not a single one feels like they're just in the background(as is the case with every single X-Men film).This wastes no time starting the plot, moves quickly, and introduces us to all the groups quite early on, and yet never feels overpowering. I realised the following is an old example, however, recently rewatching Revenge of the Sith, the difference is incredible. Both were built up to for years(at least 6 in both cases), and where that one is massively overcrowded, and quite tiring and tedious, this one isn't, even a little. I know. I can hardly believe it myself. It delivers on emotion, interaction between individuals, growth, in addition to action scenes(which, ultimately, is the bread and butter of a Summer blockbuster). Does it, outside of the bad guy's depiction, including personality and motivation, reach a level of depth akin to the solo adventures? No. It would be unrealistic to expect it to. It's not going for that. Finally, there has been a lot of reasonable concern, for how they would handle the supposed killing off of fan favorites. I'm not giving away whether or not they do, or if it's only for bit parts. What I will say is that everyone who kicks the bucket in this, on either side of the conflict, gets to be memorable and important before they do. They were very smart and how they handled that. Like everything else in this.I recommend this to anyone who finds it to be appealing. Do note that the ending is very much a setup for the next one, and doesn't feel conclusive. It used to be called part 1 for a reason. And yes, that will disappoint many - and they're not wrong. Personally, I'm just incredibly excited for Avengers 4. 10/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Tweetienator","21 November 2023","In my opinion, there are two major issues with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","kevin_robbins","20 November 2023","My wife and I watched The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023) in theaters last night. The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","skylermoore","23 November 2023","No matter how faithful a movie is to the book, it can't save itself from the fact that it's unneeded. Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","nscoby93","23 November 2023","I don't know where to start this review as I am just exhausted. Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, ""What am I missing?"" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, ""There's more?"" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10

It's mindless and random most of the times, seemed like an AI wrote it based on a templates of generic films. Good guy turns bad just because story needs him to be, two characters fall in love just for the sake of it. The dialogue between friends is constant plot point and a script note where main dude always highlights how he is poor and his friend has a rich dad, it can become a fun game because whenever these two are in the scene together you start to expect it to be mentioned, and it always does lol. Very bad, maybe writers strike affected it, but it's based on a book and I don't know maybe it's the source, I doubt I'll read it after this anyway.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","movieman6-413-929510","19 November 2023","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a prequel to the Hunger Games film series. This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","gabriel-80","15 November 2023","I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","imaxxing","18 November 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is about as overlong as its title might suggest. It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth.Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition.The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader.He partakes as a ""mentor"" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war.The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor.The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV.She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality.The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels.5/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","dannibairstow","26 November 2023","I will start by saying I don't think it's an 8, maybe a 7.5-7.7 so I rounded up.However, I went in with low expectations, expecting a big budget movie with a poor storyline but otherwise reasonably watchable. Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray"" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews. Like, what were you watching!?","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","cinemapersonified","2 December 2023","Rating: 4.7
Overall, a poorly executed movie as the direction and writing fail to build Snow up to be a bad guy to the point that they have to force this by the time the movie ends (making the first two acts of the movie feel pointless), but the movie is entertaining in the second act because they convey The Hunger Games well.Pretty Bad Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good as the director uses the large sets, VFX, and cinematography to help paint these grand scenes in both the capital and the arena of The Hunger Games (while at the same time showing its grime and dark side), the direction of The Hunger Games was good and kept the movie engaging in the middle part; the direction on a microscale was bad as the interpersonal scenes did not feel fluid at all and were not well executed; the direction of actors was bad as none of of the performances felt like they were elevated by direction; storytelling was poor as there doesn't feel like a sense of where the movie is going as builds to one thing and drastically disposes of it in favor of a something else), Decent Acting (Pretty Good from Tom Blyth (Shows some range of emotion and shows both the good and the bad side of Snow decently well), Pretty Bad from Rachel Zegler (Her accent kept on slipping and she kinda feels out of place with the rest of the cast (and the chemistry between her and Blyth is not the best); her musical moments (while forced) were carried out well as she shows off how good of a singer she is), Pretty Good from Peter Dinklage (Really just feels like he is playing many of the characters he has played in the past (the drunk character who has a lot to say) so he kinda just goes on his own), Good from Jason Schwartzman (The best performance of the movie as he plays the comedic relief character well), Pretty Bad from Hunter Schafer (Very emotionless and doesn't have any emotion with Blyth), Decent from Josh Andrés Rivera (Has moments where he shines and some moments where it feels like he's overacting), Decent from Viola Davis (Not really her best performance as it is a lot of overacting (but it doesn't feel like it is a bad performance, just not the best direction)), Decent from the rest of the cast (Hard to comment as most of the cast is child actors who feel like they weren't given the best direction)), Bad Story (The concept was pretty good as it was interesting to see the early Hunger Games and the origins of President Snow (though the carrying out of this concept was very bad); the story contruction was terrible as first act drags so much that its boring and the third act is completely out of place as it felt like they forgot to make Snow the bad guy (the second act is pretty good as its just The Hunger Games and plays to the strengths of the franchise); storytelling/flow between sequences was bad as every scene just felt forced and nothing felt like it flowed between each other (and this is especially seen in the final act as the movie has to make up for making Snow be the good guy when hes supposed to be the bad guy; character writing was very bad (Snow is terribly written as they put so much emphasis on sympathiszing him and making him be the good guy that they run out of time in making him be the bad guy and rush/force this part of the character in the end, Lucy Gray Baird is not written either as you really don't cate about her as her singing just gets really annoying towards the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue did not flow and was kinda forced; the tension build was good and carried out well in The Hunger Games act; the symbolism was very shallow as it does not do a good job in building Snow's journey for power; the foreshadowing was none-existent as the movie forces the ending because they forgot to make Snow the bad guy in the first two acts), Good Score (Carries different motifs from the original franchise), Good Cinematography (Helped show how grand the capital was and helped build the world (especially in The Hunger Games)), Good Sound (Helped in the action scenes), Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Helped make the movie feel like it was a part of the franchise and did not feel over-the-top in any way), Good Production Design (Helped with building the world), Plot Structure was the biggest issue for the movie as 2 out of the three acts were pointless (the first act builds Snow to be a good guy and really drags, the second act is pretty good as it is just The Hunger Games, and the third act is just so forced as it clearly shows that they forgot to make Snow the bad guys so they rush to give him moments that show how he's not a good person); The movie could've been split into two movies to help with runtime (with the entire third act being spun off to show how bad of a person Snow is as there are some moments in the second act that could allude to him being a bad guy, something a second movie could take and build on), Pacing was slow in the first and third act (especially in the third) but pretty good in the second act as the fast pace helped build tension in The Hunger Games, Climax was so underwhelming it was more laughable than entertaining, Tone was very similar to other Hunger Games movies.","

And now after watching the movie I realize that I would have liked it probably even less if I had read the entire book. Probably the biggest problem is that none of the main characters seem likable or realistic enough in the world for me to root for them or have the emotional down-spiral of the characters to be a good tragic drama.There is sort of this 1950s steampunk aesthetic that also made no sense to me given that this is supposed to take place in our distance future rather than the somewhat recent past. How/why would TVs in the future start to become anything like TV screens from the 50s? Are they also going to reinvent laserdiscs?The way the hunger games unfolds makes it feel completely absurd that the winner would win even with all of the cheating. Also the 2 big dramatic scenes after the games just seems confusing. Especially intermixed with some of the other scenes around them. Maybe he works better with all of the perspectives and time that an author is given in a book. But it certainly didn't make a lot of sense to me.Stumbling across the guns later in the film seemed way too coincidental too. And the motivations of the main characters was so inconsistent from one moment to the next near the end that he started to seem bipolar and phycho. I don't think they sufficiently developed his character so one could understand why/how he would work so hard for power and control. The beginning had him challenged that power and control so much that it was a wonder why he would even want any power and control over a society that he just barely seemed to care about.All in all. It's a mess, but interesting to try to follow because it seems to be such a mess.The actors seemed alright. The music was good. The cinematography was fine. But the story and characters didn't seem well developed to me. And I was frequently wondering why these characters and this timeline was being presented given that it didn't seem to answer many questions compare to all the questions and problems it raised.","

It's always interesting to see how certain things from the book were adapted on screen, adding a new experience to the story I've read.The production value, scene locations, and overall ambiance were simply amazing, capturing the essence and aesthetics of the book properly.The music, especially ""The Hanging Tree"", that Katniss sang in the original trilogy, was a highlight, linking this prequel to the original trilogy nicely. Also, the song that Olivia Rodrigo did for this movie ""Can't Catch Me Now"" fit the film's mood and themes well.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","copperhead_eglinton","5 January 2024","Whole story goes nowhere, as a viewer I have no idea what to make of Snow, why should I be invested in knowing about the character and his motives. Maybe relevant in next part IDK.Lead actress of ""Lucy Gray"" was downright obnoxious, maybe it's the way she is written, or the way actress delivers her dialogues, and the idea of singing doesn't make any sense.Games have no tense moments name a cliché character and they have it, it all looks cheesy and ridiculous.I was expecting some good world building know more about people life's, conflicts ideology behind hunger games and why it's important but it's all underwhelming. All in all glad that I didn't watched the movie in theaters.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","claszdsburrogato","15 November 2023","If there's one popular franchise that I can't seem to like, it's the Hunger Games franchise. None of the films gave me something wonderful and so special that it left such an impression on me. This new release doesn't deviate much from that. It is again a very weak film that fails to develop a story in a captivating way. This actually occurs during the middle of the film, where most of the action scenes take place. The film as a whole always seems to drag on, but part 2 is much better than the rest precisely because it escapes this tiring pace that doesn't go anywhere. Part 3 is where it gets even more tiring. The film always seems to be coming to an end, but it never ends. The beginning and middle seem not to be connected with the end. It feels like you're watching two movies and it ends up being even more unbearable. There are many problems in the development of the story as a whole, especially those of some important characters. It's a mediocre film that doesn't deviate from the franchise's standards. It's not the worst, it's not the best. It is a film that becomes forgettable.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","simoneminotti","16 November 2023","I like the other hunger games movies, with their high and lows they were enjoyable. They were a good transposition of the books.With this one I was waiting impatiently for the end.Performances felt a little bit off, as off felt the dialogues. However the main problem to me is the lack of a central idea. It is not clear if they wanted to show a specific edition of the hunger games, if they wanted to explore Lucy and the other tributes, if they wanted to tell the story from Snow's perspective or if they wanted to explain how the modern hunger game came to life. The film it's all over the places, characters are not explored nor do they make an effort to allow the viewer to empathize with them, they're so empty and unlikable.If this is not enough they even sing. Lucy Grey straight out from the arena, after seeing the death of 24plus people is on a stage singing like a mermaid. And the singing goes on and on to the point where I can confidently sai that the last 30 minutes the film become a musical.The only likable character is portrayed by Dinklage and he dies.","

Really. Tedious and tiresome.The directing is just abysmally horrible.And then there are the actors. Holy crow, you won't care one bit about them. And the worst of the worst is the girl who plays Lucy Grey. She cannot act her way out of a paper bag. It is of no wonder Disney cancelled Snow ""White. She's horrible.And speaking of horrible, adding insult to injury, we are forced to listen to her sing the most dismally boring tunes literally every 15 minutes.My head was going to explode. She has a horrible voice too with poor pitch and a vibrato that will make your ear drums twitch.I truly wonder who thought this movie was a good idea.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","stevenschultz-80475","30 December 2023","What do you get when you cross a backstory nobody asked for with a near ten years hiatus?Trash.The lone bright spot in this movie is Jason Schwartzman's Lucky Flickerman, but even that character is a little too on the nose. Throughout the movie, Lucky included, there are nods as if to say ""Hey you, you remember The Hunger Games, right? Remember how much you loved the Hunger Games?""
At the same time, there is this bizarre knockoff Fallout aesthetic that permeates everything. It's a post apocalyptic dystopia following a terrible civil war, but also everything is old timey like the 1940s?On top of the terrible execution of world-building, and the weird 2020s Disney angle of ""giving a heartless villain a sympathetic backstory,"" it feels like the cast of this movie was pulled out of a McDonald's kitchen. Not a single character other than Lucky is the least bit memorable, and Lucy Gray's accent borders on a hate crime.If you like the Hunger Games, just rewatch Catching Fire.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","maiananaa","23 December 2023","The tributes pictured to be willingly killing each other without any meaningful explanation. Even the lead character Lucy could just let a sick girl drinking a poisonous water without doing anything even though the arena was clear, in my opinion at least.We are supposed to have something to hold on to when watching this, and I don't supposed it could be those mentors, who could just stand still seeing everyone killed each other as a career without no remorse.I remembered the passion watching Hunger Games came from Katniss' spirit of fighting, and also her compassion. Even at the most desperate moments, she still tried to find a way to save the one next to her. I think that's what make the horrible games could light a bit of hope.But in this movie, it just became meaningless. I don't think the singing at the end of the game could turn us to be more sympathetic. I don't know whether the games itself were designed to be more underrated in this franchise, but the characters themselves didn't exactly try to make us root for them.And also the sequence somehow didn't make sense, how could one fall in love easily with someone who just watched her fighting over her life the whole time? Not to mention to be a watching material by the whole nation.. At least there should be a little grudge or hate emotion at first, but no... Lucy and Snow seemed not to be able to keep their eyes off of each other from the very beginning.At least for me, it just made the story less natural, it seemed to be forced to fit the purpose of Snow and the plot just made it become less likeable from the start. It was supposed to be a heroic fight (games), instead we were served with typical teenage romance.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","DymSym","2 January 2024","If the hunger games was all about fascist myth making and how people just come to accept it as the new way of life, why would the protagonist be less angry 10 years into the new order than 75 years? When injustice is a new, people are supposed to be more angry, less accepting of it. Katniss was appropriately angry and defiant, whereas Lucy Gray was immediately giddy (i guess we are meant to interpret it as hippie freespirit i-love-all-peoples charm), and flirting with an agent of the state that has literally reaped her into an arena to kill her. Think of how much it would take to justify why a Jewish girl might even consider thinking of an SS soldier in a romantic light, and how little this story did to that end. The trust and romance between two characters from opposing sides of a fascist occupation has to OVERCOME that very tall barrier to earn any Rebel's trust. However even though the fact that Snow is doing it for personal gain was established, it was kind of ignored to continue this bizzare unearned romance.I am also okay with the premise that not every person in a fascist system is born evil, and showing the descent of a regular citizen into this kind of evil. However, living and participating every day in a fascist state has to impact your soul that ends up showing in small ways, casual dehuminisation of the Panem citizens, growing paranoia as the bombs start, disdain for the rebels etc. Which other characters in the academy and Grandma Snow does. But exceptionally, Snow was shown to be upstanding and moral throughout the movie except in the end with a abrupt descent into betraying his friend, all the while romancing a Panem citizen outside the district borders. It was so forced, and why?? We already knew that Snow would become evil, so why not show us how it happened in a believable manner (maybe show that his time as a peacekeeper interacting with D12 citizens allowed him to dehumanize them or something..), instead of rushing it as a ""twist"" at the very end of a very long movie? Every story in THG was a self contained plot that will be developed upon it, but this one felt like a botched incomplete story to that is built as a premise for sequels to the prequel.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ajcontre16","17 November 2023","As someone who has read the book multiple times, this is an awful adaption of an incredibly well written book. The entire movie is rushed to the point where it should have been split into two. Important characters are barely involved or completely cut out. How do you show Clemencia get bitten by the snakes then nothing of her afterwards????! No Pluribus Bell, Satiria or interactions with the Plinths... Viola Davis is a remarkable job with what she was given, but come one!!! No Hippity hoppity, not once? So much of the fear of her character comes from her craziness and it was missing.There was absolutely no chemistry between Snow and Lucy Gray. Their relationship is completely left out of the movie and that is due to the rush through of the story. Rachel Ziegler was a terrible choice for this role. She may be able to sing, but cannot act at all. Her entire portrayal of Lucy Gray was off and disappointing.The book it full of character development for Coriolanus Snow that isn't depicted in the film. You don't see the struggle he has within himself, let alone the final blow to his goodness by loosing the trust and love of Lucy Gray. This change is what makes Snow who he is later in life and why, I believe, he hates Katniss. There are many similarities between these two women and Katniss reminds him of a past weakness and betrayal. This is shown by subtle foreshadowing. Unfortunately we don't see these changes of character in the movie and that is the entire point of the book. To find out why Snow became an evil and spineless person without feeling.So many important moments were left off or changed that it was frustrating and took every ounce of self control not to walk out of the theater. Poorly done...","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","mickeythechamp","13 December 2023","The Hunger Games return and I'm not sure whySure, I was exited as any to return to this universe and have some fun. While I'm not the biggest fan of the original movies, I still see them as very entertaining. The problem here is the lack of focus and missing some really easy focus points. This movie is really easy to save by simply focusing on one of the storylines more, but it derails itself by being more or less 2 movies in one, and I would have preferred this to be split so we really got a situation where we could dive deep into the world and it's characters instead of a surface level look.Coriolanus Snow is a young man training to become leader of the capital. He and his fellow classmates are assigned to make the 10th Hunger Game more interesting by making the contestants famous before fighting.The biggest issues with the movie to me is the aforementioned lack of focus. The movie is very easy to fixed by focusing on some of its elements more, since they are actually interesting. Making a movie about the first fame Hunger Game is such a good idea. What went right and wrong, how would they turn the people and the ideas, and some of these elements are here, but are never in the forefront. The same could be said about the journey of Snow. He has to turn into something, but that journey is not clear or well-made. The first half of the movie his barely in focus, and by the end, the journey he makes in the second half doesn't match the first. It's a mes. Even the romance aspect is rushed. The movie wanted to do too many things at once, and the result makes a movie that is barely about the things it's about.The characters also lack depth and story to really make us care and root for them. Snow's character is poorly explained, since everybody goes along with his idea, even people in power! Why? He's a kid! The lack of emotions and attachments really got to me, and it bored me.Because the movie becomes boring. It got to a point where I simply didn't care anymore. It goes from one thing and derails into its own sequel, and without the focus it feels uneventful, and it becomes too long, split this movie into 2 with more focus, and you have 2 decent movies.There are some good performances and shots though and some really gripping scenes, some involving guns, some with mockingbirds, it's interesting that the movie feels this well-made while the script doesn't, I think the grandness despaired for me. The Hunger Games isn't big yet, and it can be felt. It seems more boring and lifeless, and that's the point, the problem is that we, the audience, also fell that.I also need to question the Katniss moment from the first Hunger Games. It bothers me that she started a rebellion when she did. In this movie, there is even a Katniss type character doing a similar event to hers. Why didn't that start a riot? Who knows.While some of the performances are good, the dialogue is terrible and the actors don't have a lot to work with, sadly. It makes them look bad, but it's easy to distinguish that it's not the actor but their material.This movie with a way too long title is a mess. I really wanted to like it and while there are elements I did like, the story told just simply didn't grip me at all. It was a boring and too long experience, and the problem for me is that I can see the easy fixes, which means the team missed it somehow.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","naomix-07733","18 November 2023","Initially I didn't like the ending. I didn't like how they just made her 'disappear'. I was voicing my frustration to my sister the entire way home; No chase? No fighting? No crying, no betrayal, no epilogue, no letter? Nothing??? It was so anti-climactic! Like she never even existed!But then Highbotton's words rang clear: mystery has a way of driving people mad. If we the audience were this frustrated, imagine just how delirious it must've made Snow. She could've outed him, betrayed him, stood up to him, maybe even messaged him- he must've searched for her if just to get rid of the last loose end (before he became too powerful to even bother with this anymore, of course), but he found absolutely nothing! Nothing to chase, nothing to hate, nothing to even confirm that it was real other than his fading memories, white roses and a ghost of her who with the same spirit sings that damn song under the hanging tree.I can't help but think that what if she'd stayed? He'd lied, and he had violence, and all those other bad things in his being already, but the only thing that was keeping him from going through that door was Lucy gray. It doesn't excuse nor explain his action (not even by the slightest) but I can't help but wonder if she'd stayed, would he still turn out that way? Not necessarily the whole tyrannical dictator coming into power stuff- but fundamentally could he have become a better human being? Could he have changed? And was her departure his sign to finally cave in, or was he going to turn out like that anyway?Also the hunger games were freaking crazy I loved every second of it, favorite part of the movie. Jason Schwartzman was perfect.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Fizgig777","7 February 2024","First off, the script writer, if they read the book the movie is supposed to be based on, did not have a good understanding of the story and completely missed the character development and connections between them. There are some movies based on books where you can get away with not faithfully telling the story and still leave the viewer feeling like the story was told.... That did NOT work for this book to movie combo. While the movie was overly lengthy, it still didn't capture the essence of the story. What it captured was a lot of bad acting, particularly the female lead. Unlike the book, I couldn't get invested in any of the characters in the movie at all; didn't care who lived or died. The evolution of a marginally decent human being to a completely despot wasn't shown well by the movie at all. Maybe emotion behind that transformation is better written and read.... One thing is certain, the lead male actor just wasn't up to that kind of acting - he wasn't particularly good as it was.As a standalone movie, it's terrible; convoluted, overly lengthy, boring. As a prequel, it falls way short.... As an adaptation of a well written novel, an embarrassment.Feel sorry for folks who payed to see this poor adaptation.... Read the book! Unfortunately, the movie was so badly done, it likely put ppl off the book if they hadn't already read it.","

The pacing seems way too quick to establish any sort of connection.I don't think this movie deserves to be titled ""The Hunger Games"". It doesn't come close to the story telling of the original franchise. Besides, the CGI used in this movie occasionally gives vibes of a low budget production (smoke, fire, ...).Personally, I wouldn't recommend the movie. It joins the ranks of productions like ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", a pathetic attempt at reviving a franchise which already died happily.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Elvis-Del-Valle","29 November 2023","Despite the disappointing ending to the saga in Mockingjay Part 2, that did not prevent us from continuing to explore the universe of The Hunger Games further. This prequel focuses on Snow's beginnings as a humble young man who questions the methods that the Capitol uses to discipline the rebels, but throughout the film he discovers the truth about what human beings are capable of. All through his relationship with Lucy Gray hoping to regulate the methods of the Capitol. Unlike the previous films, this is a longer and more dramatic story that does not focus solely on the Hunger Games, but mostly on Snow's transmission. It is a worthy installment that serves as a prologue to the saga, even without the presence of Katniss Everdeen. It has that metaphorical characteristic that has always defined the saga with respect to capitalism, social inequality and what human beings are capable of doing by instinct. Rachel Zegler gives a spectacular performance in many ways, including her musical numbers. There is no doubt that The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a great film that revives the saga again and is a good option for those who do not know the saga to begin to enter this apocalyptic universe created by Suzanne Collins. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.","

Unfortunately the creators left that question open. The female main actress had no purpose other than singing, looking suspicious (with no reason eventually) and the main actor focused on staring into the void most of the time, making very very unlogical decisions and flipping his mind like a burger patty. Real disappointment and big waste of time. I thought till the end, there must be a conclusion, something connecting the dots. But they left the dots as they were. Far too long, no story, bad acting, boring. If you expect something like the originals, stay away. And if you happen to understand the story, let me know.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","echerie7","15 November 2023","This movie was so disappointing, there was just something missing across the board. Acting was okay but none of the actors had chemistry, the stakes didn't feel very high at any point, and the singing was both excessive and borderline comical in timing. The movie preached many times that viewers need someone to root for and someone to hate, whilst simultaneously doing the exact opposite by giving us neither.What made the original Hunger Games great was that you believed in the characters backstories, and you could get drawn into it. Snow and Casca felt real, but everyone else somehow felt like a caricature of a person. Kudos to both of these actors who did a phenomenal job, it just somehow wasn't cohesive with the other characters who felt somewhat 2-dimensional.Lucy in particular felt over-acted and I struggled to root for her - the chemistry with Snow falling particularly flat. Did I mention the singing was insanely overdone? In contrast, the brief screen time that Clemensia and Snow shared felt far more genuine and intriguing, and I would've liked to understand her and Snow's friendship more.Overall the movie felt messy and lacking in heart. I had been so excited for this movie for so long and was disappointed at how disconnected it felt. Whilst I understand that singing is woven throughout the book, this felt like one of those things that in a movie felt out of place. Perhaps it was the way it was acted, I'm not sure, but even as low budget as the 1st Hunger Games movie was.... I felt connected to the characters and their journey, which was not the case here.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","valid_point","18 November 2023","Watching 2h 38min was as long as it sounds. The beginning looked promising: the yet undeveloped execution of the Hunger Games, the whole scenery or the introducing of Snow as the anti-hero who never actually despises the idea of the Hunger Games but still is human, empathetic and caring. There was some sort of character shift towards turning evil (like the scene he admits killing this one tribune felt powerful), but it never really got to a breaking point. Nevertheless Tom Blyth was the perfect choice who did a great job at what the writers gave him - which was way more than what they did to build a proper love story. Lucy's and Snow's romance felt forced, rushed and unconvincing.Which brings me to the biggest problem the film has: Rachel Zegler. Her acting was so poor I couldn't grasp any personality traits of Lucy Gray who should have been the strong woman on the outside but scared woman on the inside. Instead, her whole presence drowned in arrogance which didn't stop even after Lucy just experienced the most horrific days in her life in the Hunger Games Arena (like shouldn't she suffer from PTSD?)
Zegler has absolutely zero charisma that watching her felt exhausting. She definitely is a gifted singer - as the movie shows us several times - but that doesn't compensate her complete lack of acting skills. On the contrary, the more she sings the more the movie turns into these unnecessary and irritating musical episodes of any CW show.So if you are a fan of the original Hunger Games movies, you will definitely found enjoyable moments - if you already dislike Rachel Zegler before watching this movie, I would skip it.","

I was so excited that there was a new Hunger Games only to be surprised by how horrible it was. All the singing made it super cheesy like it was Disney movie, and it started to feel like a musical. The acting was horrible, the storyline was not engaging at all, which led to boredom throughout the movie. It dragged out forever and there were many times that I looked at my phone and was irritated that there was so much time left in the movie and nothing interesting had happened. The original Hunger Games was intense and had you hooked within the first five minutes of the movie. This movie was dry and I had no real direction that made sense. It was a total flop and I wouldn't waste your money.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","raul-verma","19 November 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" attempts to explore the origins of a notorious villain, President Snow, but ultimately falls short in its execution. While the concept of delving into the past of such a complex character is intriguing, the narrative feels sluggish and fails to deliver the depth and intensity expected from the Hunger Games universe.The portrayal of a young Coriolanus Snow lacks the compelling depth needed to justify his transformation into the iconic antagonist of the original trilogy. The pacing struggles to maintain engagement, with stretches of the story feeling drawn out and disconnected. Additionally, the dynamic between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray Baird, the tribute he mentors, lacks the emotional resonance required to truly invest the audience in their relationship. Rachel Zeigler acting sucks as well.Moreover, the exploration of the early Hunger Games lacks the gripping tension and moral complexity that made the original trilogy so captivating. Instead, it feels more like a diluted version, missing the edge-of-your-seat excitement and the thought-provoking commentary on society and power dynamics.Overall, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" fails to live up to the standards set by the previous Hunger Games installments, offering a lackluster portrayal of a compelling villain's origins and missing the mark in terms of both storytelling and character development.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ljungers20","17 November 2023","I had very high hopes for this film. The book was great, but the movie was horrible. Only Tom Blyth does a good job acting in this film, the rest of the cast... not so much. Rachel Ziegler just isn't a great actress, granted she is a very talented singer and has a great voice, which is put on display in this movie. However, she just isn't a great actress. The film has the worst cast I have ever seen for a spin off of such a successful original series. I put blame on the casting director for that. The movie also came in a bit longer than most of the other movies and kind of felt a little dragged out. Overall, I'm very disappointed.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","dehoopdanielle","16 November 2023","I came out of the cinema with my friend and we both wondered what we had actually just seen.Is this a villain origin story?Because if so, then why is there NO character arc for Snow at all?From the moment you meet Coriolanus Snow (despite the lacking story still wonderfully played by Tom Blyth), he is selfish, overly ambitious and mean. For this reason, I don't buy into his romance with Lucy for a minute, and I actually think they didn't want you to. But if the romance isn't real, that means there is no catalyst for Snow's character to make him evil, because as I said, he was already selfish, manipulative and mean to begin with. It makes you wonder why we needed this film in the first place.Next to this, I didn't understand Lucy's character. She wears colorful clothes, lots of make-up and sings musical songs which all feels off for someone living in district 12.On top of this, I also didn't understand her motives and emotions. Is she angry she has to fight for her life in the hunger games? She didn't really seem to be to me, as she quickly trusts Snow and eats his food and even tries to kiss him. And then when she wins the fight you would expect her to be traumatized and bitter, but no, she just picks up her guitar again and dances around in her not-so-Gray clothes.Finally, as the romance isn't real, why did she invite Snow to escape with her to the North and then on the way there tries to get rid of him?! It just didn't make sense to me AT ALL.Still gave this three stars because I liked Tom Blyth's performance and the visuals were nice, I guess.","

In my opinion she RZ can't hold a candle to her previous female counter part. She is so mono tone and her facial expressions are very lacking. She just was not near ready for this type of role. Her past roles she could get by just being somewhat pretty and that's about it. I think the movie industry has never recovered since covid. And trying to reboot everything isn't helping. PD and VD do an amazing job. The main male character does well. However the two have zero chemistry it's like AH acting next to JD.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","PerryAtTheMovies","27 November 2023","7.6/10This is my first time being introduced to the world of ""The Hunger Games"" and I will say that I was pleasantly entertained. I don't know what to expect from here on out, but I hope to be as entertained, if not more, by the original movies of the series.The story was engaging and separated into three parts that made it enjoyable. Everything from the introduction of the Games to evasions to conclusions were well executed. Despite the film being violent prone it still comes across as tense and deadly without showing anything too gruesome to maintain its PG rating.The acting was strong. The actors were well suited for their roles, and only based on trailers, I found the young Snow builds well for the original movies, but unknown for certain. I loved the chemistry between Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth.The music was terrific. Zegler has an amazing voice, and her songs obviously work well into the film. The visuals are mostly incredible. There's a few spots where it's very obviously screen acting. Part of me hopes they did have physical sets cause there were portions that felt genuine.Overall, you don't need to have seen the previous films to understand what's going on, but it may help to better understand who the characters are. Acting is strong, music is great, and the story is amazing enough to make me want to see the rest of ""The Hunger Games"".That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Kim_F_T_R","15 November 2023","Incredibly disappointing, and here's why:
Too much content and story forced into the movie, making it rushed and, at times, quite messy.Hardly any likable characters; didn't get to know any of them particularly well and certainly didn't sympathize with them.Too much singing.Some props, costumes, and elements threw me off, making me forget this was part of the Hunger Games universe. It felt more like a drama romance from the present time, especially in the second half of the movie. Some characters seemed oddly 2023-like, despite being set hundreds of years into the future. Rachel Zegler, in particular, just ""looks"" Gen Z.Viola Davis, the queen, in a cheap costume and with an even cheaper manuscript.The other Hunger Games movies were like an emotional rollercoaster, whereas this movie left me uninterested and little invested. I was really not looking forward to feeling ""nothing"".","

The actual ""Hunger Game"" in the movie at its most basic state in the timeline was entertaining while it lasted and the lead playing a young Snow along with Viola Davis chewing the scenery as a maniacal villain are the highlights, but too many musical numbers (there was all of one instance of singing in the original series) along with the stiff acting of the female lead and the tired length, made this seem like a Hunger Games if it was made by Disney. A bit too cheesy and long in the tooth, and a disappointment when held in regards of what came before.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","houstonperez","26 December 2023","As someone who has read the book multiple times, this is an awful adaption of an incredibly well written book. The entire movie is rushed to the point where it should have been split into two. Important characters are barely involved or completely cut out. How do you show Clemencia get bitten by the snakes then nothing of her afterwards????! No Pluribus Bell, Satiria or interactions with the Plinths... Viola Davis is a remarkable job with what she was given, but come on!!! No Hippity hoppity, not once? So much of the fear of her character comes from her craziness and it was missing.There was absolutely no chemistry between Snow and Lucy Gray. Their relationship is completely left out of the movie and that is due to the rush through of the story. Rachel Ziegler was a terrible choice for this role. She may be able to sing, but cannot act at all. Her entire portrayal of Lucy Gray was off and disappointing.The book it full of character development for Coriolanus Snow that isn't depicted in the film. You don't see the struggle he has within himself, let alone the final blow to his goodness by loosing the trust and love of Lucy Gray. This change is what makes Snow who he is later in life and why, I believe, he hates Katniss. There are many similarities between these two women and Katniss reminds him of a past weakness and betrayal. This is shown by subtle foreshadowing. Unfortunately we don't see these changes of character in the movie and that is the entire point of the book. To find out why Snow became an evil and spineless person without feeling.So many important moments were left off or changed that it was frustrating and took every ounce of self control not to walk out of the theater. Poorly done...One last thing! Great job Rachel Zegler, you succeeded in ruining another movie just by the charm of your horrible acting, singing, facial expressions and explicit talent to not learn any skill required to succeed as an actress. Amazing casting for Snow, that guy nailed the role, but holy moly what a utter pile dog-sheet this movie was because of Rachel Zegler. Don't even get me started on the singing. Its unreal how this unfunny personality is getting such major roles whereas super talented talent out there never sees the light of the day. Rachel Zegler is an absolute talentless person and should not be given roles as significant as this one.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Gleek4eva","18 November 2023","I saw this movie on opening night. I have not been able to stop thinking about it since... I read the original trilogy but never got around to reading the prequel but decided to just see the movie. Rachel Zegler receives hate because of a comment she made about a completely different movie (Snow White), and it's completely irrelevant to this movie. She performed more than beautifully in this role. She is a classically trained soprano, and was singing beautifully in her chest voice and with a really good twangy accent (which is more of a mezzo/alto type of singing in this case). From one classically-trained singer with a degree in music who performs for a living to everyone out there afraid to give this movie a chance because of all of this biases against this young woman- SHE IS GOOD! This girl is talented, and the hate is stupid.This movie was by no means perfect, but it was really good. I would have thought it was a perfect 10 if the action was better paced. It was nothing on her part. Definitely not as good as Catching Fire (the peak of the series to me), but better than both of the Mockingjays! Give it a shot without a bias of this young women in your mind and you just might find yourself enjoying it ;)","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Notbrainwashed","18 November 2023","This film is the definition of a split personality. It's called Hunger Games but you only see something like that in it's first half hour, since the filmmakers had the bright idea to escalate the film in it's first act, putting the first act as the second act and then the third act as the second. Are you confused? Well, look at them! The result is that you think the movie is ending but it eventually takes a ""break"" and resumes in about five minutes. I am addressing to you Hollywood movie makers: beginning?, middle?, end?, world building?, exposition?, protagonist testing?, twist?, climax? Don't they remind you of anything? The movie ends and you don't know what you've seen, you are confused. Where is the catharsis? Who is good and who is bad in this movie? I didn't know whose side to take and when the viewer doesn't know whose side to take he's lost.But yes the movie has some positives (thankfully). The soundtrack, cgi and color grading are very good but it's such a shame that these were wasted in a festival of bad script and direction. It's hard to believe that Francis Lawrence has directed this film. Oh and if you're going to turn it into a musical halfway through you'd better tell us from the start.It's unbelievable and sad what is happening in modern Hollywood. They're just trying to make money based on strong and beloved franchises by changing them and throwing in minimal work. The only instances of them coming up with anything worthwhile yet are those of the known greats in the game like Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, Cameron, Villeneuve, Tom Cruz, etc.","

The audience still get treated for what we are to them; cold cash.It's hard to say where this movie went wrong, because not much went right, really.The movie is set in the amazing dystopian universe created by Suzanne Collins, that the first 2 Hunger Games movies could, to a fairly high degree, do justice.Unfortunately, this movie does everything but. The storyline is scattered all over the place, none of the characters are remotely interesting and the writing is just... oh man. Stop singing!!!The only two good things to say about this movie, are:
1. The production value is high (kudos to the people trying to do their job, even when the state they work in is way below their standard).2. Some of the actors do a good job, considering the scripts they've been given. Tom Blyth and Viola Davis are the two main names here.Unfortunately, the singing Rachel is also in the movie, so you kind of forget that some of the actors actually try to do a good job.Needless to say, I won't be wishing for any snow this winter.","

Many scenes were poorly written and the directing was a bit over-dramtic. But one thing that the whole movie failed for me was the explanation of Snows motivation, how his character developed such strong compassion for the hunger games and why he is who he really is as a president. No character has an evil agenda, unfortunately this movie doesn't show the depth of Snows character. All of the sudden he turns evil and I dont understand his actions. I have not read the book but I believe that there are so much potential. The movie tried to focus on the love interest but failed that part too.","

The film starts with public executions where suddenly someone starts singing, which gives you the feeling of watching a musical, quite cringe.

The structure is otherwise boring, the environment is dark all the time with a kind of gray arena and a lot of the play takes place in caves. There isn't a single heroic or heroic scene, nothing that makes the movie enjoyable. The film had no depth to the characters at all, everyone was equally flat.

I haven't read the book but if it's exactly like how this movie is then I'd probably hate the book too. It's really sad because Snow could have had such a better backstory. And is it just me or are a lot of movies now just trying to put singing in wherever they can? Lucy might be like it in the book but I found it rather annoying. When Katniss sang you could see it meant so much. It was deep and powerful and it wasn't over the top. It was songs about serious things. I didn't like Lucy at all. I think there could have been someone else that would have sold her character more. I don't know why but even though they tried to make it seem like they were in love I found that it was quite the opposite. It felt too forced like as if the actors didn't have any chemistry but they just wanted to make it work. Snow's character was strong but it just doesn't seem like a good enough story. I was expecting him to like kill Lucy, instead she disappears(come on!) and he's like oh well I guess I'll just go back to the capitol and wait my turn for president. It doesn't seem like a bad enough excuse for him to be a rotten person. Even if he killed and sold out his best friend, I was expecting a lot more to be on the line or something big taken away from him to turn him into the evil and messed up person he is in the first films. His story just sucks.Often Snow would jump on the back of trucks or do something he shouldn't be right in front of the peacekeepers lol. I know mistakes happen but there was lots of that and it made it feel like it wasn't very believable. I wanted to be completely drawn in and not have to pick out these little things. Unbelievable. Could have and should have drawn the line at mockingjay.","

The problem is this is an incredibly boring villain origin story. Do we blame the book? I read it and it's not great so that's part of the problem...Despite the book's failings I think so much could have been done with the movie, characters better fleshed out, maybe a way to know Snow's inner dialogue would have helped. Anyways Hunger Games fans like myself will watch the movie and probably like it. I gave it a five for the actors who did the best with what they had and a nicely done dystopian world. There's too many misses to mention, but nonsensical plot lines, poor costuming, and lack of real chemistry between the lead characters are top of my list.

I did thoroughly enjoy it! However, there are so many things that they left out that I felt were integral to the story. In order to properly see Snow for who he is-a spineless boy who only does things that look good to others-I think they needed to spend more time with the character. I'm not usually a fan of two parters, but this one really should've been. The characters fell flat to me because we didn't get great looks into them.My boyfriend, who didn't read the book, really liked it and said he felt he understood the characters well enough though. So maybe it's just a me problem.Because so much of the book is Snow's internal monologue, I know it would've been hard to capture that properly on film, but I think they could've. Also, it's SO much darker in the book, and I think that was necessary for the audience to see.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","douglaspereira77","1 December 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes left me feeling like I was stuck in a bizarre dystopian version of American Idol. The story wanders around like it's on a quest for purpose, centering vaguely on two characters who seem as lost as I was trying to follow the plot. And then there's Rachel Zegler, popping up like a musical fairy godmother every 5 minutes. I half-expected her to break into 'Hunger Games: The Musical' , anyone?The film's attempt to weave a compelling narrative feels more like attempting to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded - confusing and with no clear resolution in sight. The decision to turn it into a pseudo-musical only adds to the bewilderment, leaving me wondering if I accidentally stumbled into a Capitol-sponsored talent show.Rachel Zegler's constant musical interludes make you question if she has a secret contract to ensure a song every 300 seconds. It's like the filmmakers discovered a 'Sing for Survival' clause in the Hunger Games rulebook. I can't decide if it's a desperate attempt to inject life into the story or an unintentional audition tape for 'America's Got Talent.'The storyline is as elusive, full of plot holes. It's like they dropped a bag of breadcrumbs in the woods, and we're left wandering in circles, trying to make sense of the narrative maze. The movie's plot is more twisted than the Capitol's fashion choices, leaving me with a sense of confusion.In the end, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes feels like a failed attempt to remix a dystopian classic. It's not a symphony of storytelling; it's a cacophony of confusion with a side of unwanted musical numbers. If the Hunger Games were a competition for viewer endurance, this movie would win hands down. May the odds be ever in your favor if you decide to give it a watch - you might need it.""","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","masonsaul","18 November 2023","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes lacks any subtlety in what the Hunger Games are truly about, allowing it to go further with those core ideas than ever before. The class divide has never been bigger and the desperation that makes people abandon all morals to ensure their success is such a clear through line in this story, even after the games are over.Whilst the film remains engaging throughout, the structure is a little weird. It's nicely divided into 3 chapters with two focusing on the games and one after which means the final third has to speed run Snow's growing villainy. The decision to keep it as one film was greatly appreciated however, either a slightly longer run time or splitting in two might have actually helped for once.Tom Blyth makes the role of Coriolanus Snow his own and is the only reason the complete change of character in the third act works, laying hints throughout that this side of him might have been there all along. Similarly, Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray creates a character who's the complete opposite of Katniss (extroverted, loves performing) and her singing is incredible.Josh Andrés Rivera is the moral centre and real tragedy of the film, a character too pure for the world he's born into. Viola Davis gives such a cartoonish performance in a way only an actor of her calibre could pull off and Jason Schwartzman is the best. He's the only one allowed to have fun with it, delivering the only jokes and continuing what Stanley Tucci started.When it comes to franchise reboots it's usually not a good idea to bring back the same guy who did the last ones but returning director Francis Lawrence does a great job. The practical and CG elements are blended together really well and it's helped massively by Uli Hanisch's production design which crafts a more analogue world with a stripped down Hunger Games.Similarly, returning composer James Newton Howard does another wonderful job. Callbacks are kept to a minimum and replaced with some epic tragedy that compliments the doomed romance whilst once again communicating the brutality of the games in a way the PG-13 rating still can't.","

Acting is sub-par, perhaps could have improved with better casting. There was too much singing in the movie that just didn't fit.

You're supposed to ""care"" about the contestants, but you really don't. I really struggled to find any point to this movie. The writers must have just thrown the script up in the air and put it back together as they picked them off the floor. Movie has no ""bite"" to it.

Of course, time went on & there was little to no word if a prequel was coming until I saw a trailer pop up a few month prior to me seeing this & to be honest, I didn't feel bought by it, but still, being a fan of the Hunger Games, I went to see this nonetheless.Years before he becomes the tyrannical president of Panem, 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow remains the last hope for his fading lineage. With the 10th annual Hunger Games fast approaching, the young Snow becomes alarmed when he's assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird from District 12. Uniting their instincts for showmanship & political savvy, they race against time to ultimately reveal who's a songbird & who's a snake.I found the film to be surprisingly good & better than what I thought. I mean, it wasn't as upbeat or vibrant as the first 2 Hunger Games Films, but still was action packed enough & watchable despite dragging near the end & in other places too. The films runtime is 2 hours & 27 minutes in length & could've 20-25 minutes shorter.The characters were good & memorable enough & the games were exciting enough & enjoyable when the action did kick into gear. The music & visuals were good as with the effects that were used. Though I do feel the film could've benefited from being livened up a bit & again, be faster paced & shorter. It lacks the feel of the original films, but of course I did expect as much with this film being a prequel to the first 4 films.Overall, it was actually pretty good for a prequel. While it drags & is a whopping 147 minutes, it's a good film that's worth a watch. It's got good enough action in it along with some great characters, visuals & effects. But could've been shorter, faster paced & more vibrant.7/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","isaacsundaralingam","17 November 2023","I am not the biggest fan of the Hunger Games franchise. I don't hate it, but I've never found anything all that likeable about it. It was, and still is my opinion that the Hunger Games are the weakest execution of the battle royale concept in all of film and television. So naturally, I didn't really have high hopes going into this movie.The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is split into 3 parts: the first, an introduction to Coriolanus Snow and his friendship with Lucy Gray; the second, the actual Hunger Games; and the third, the aftermath. I have to admit that I did find the first two parts somewhat enjoyable, albeit the obvious lack of any serious character development. It still had some charm and some wit about it to keep me interested, despite it feeling like the writers didn't really put in the effort to lay the foundations to make these characters live up to their full potentials.But all of that was nothing compared to how unbelievably disappointing the final part was. If you thought the character development in the first two parts were rushed, you're not ready for what the third has done. Characters are going through serious mental and philosophical transformations within periods that make it almost comical to watch, and through actions that just make no sense given the context of what has already been established. It was jarring and felt like it needed its own movie to flesh the action out to be consistent.This movie does nothing to change my opinion on the franchise. Maybe makes it slightly worse, but I could ignore it on a good day. For the fans of the Hunger Games and for those who care a lot about the series however, this movie could be a fun 150 minutes.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","miaballantyne-83689","17 November 2023","Was this a worthy prequel? No. How many times did I check the time throughout? Around 20. Unbelievably slow and boring. Lack of chemistry between 'Lucy Gray' and Snow, was genuinely quite confusing watching their relationship. Why did Snow turn evil? Actually unsure. So many plot holes. The hunger games were extremely hard to watch, so gory and unnecessary. Could not stand Lucy Gray as a character, she weirdly kept breaking into song. NO comedic relief whatsoever. All characters were poorly developed, and for the most part unlikeable. Costume design felt really poorly executed, all of the costumes for the 'poor' felt very inaccurate, looked like they had gone to a fancy dress shop and asked for Aladdin clothing. Also why was Lucy Gray playing what looked like a very expensive guitar. Extremely inconsistent as some parts felt modern and some felt extremely old- fashioned. The 3 parts to the movie were poorly split and it honestly was so long for really nothing much to happen, was very choppy. Only good part was Snow being extremely hot.","

He is mesmerized by District 12's Lucy Gray and her singing. Coriolanus wants to achieve back his family's lost glory and he wants to do it through Lucy Gray. He along with his best friend Sejanus are sympathetic towards the tributes and wants to do the right thing, amidst the rebel's constant attacks. What truly happens post the Hunger Games, the impact it has on Coriolanus and his friendship forms rest of the story.This was indeed a lengthy film and unlike the earlier trilogy, this doesn't feature the Hunger Games for that long. Probably, that is what got me a bit restless as the drama took a whole 2 parts to settle in. It is only in the part 3 where I was able to invest properly as the story focused on Coriolanus, Sejanus and Lucy Gray. What the film did succeed in getting the dystopian world setting despite the Hunger Games segment not being that intense. This still manages to set up the story for the sequels to take over and there is enough mystery intact to stay interested.","

Love the book's author, loved the entire original Hunger Games books and movies, and my husband and I really looked forward to this movie. As dark as the original stories were, they were bright and colorful compared to this movie. The world in Snow's youth seemed even more dangerous and uglier than when Katniss came into the story, which made me wonder why were supposed to be so worried about her. The acting wasn't very good, the screenplay was awful, and the sense of doom and ugliness made me want to take a shower when we got home. Frankly, we wouldn't encourage anyone to see it.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Coventry","26 December 2023","As chairman of the federation against unnecessary overlong movies and, moreover, active member of a committee entitled ""your film's title should be shorter"", you can imagine that I wasn't really looking forward to - here we go - ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"". 158 minutes! 158 minutes for a prequel of which you know from beforehand how it will end! Because basically the essence of the film is, like in ""Joker"" or ""Star Wars: episode III: Revenge of the Sith"", about how the protagonist will eventually turn into a sardonic and loathsome villain.But hey, it was Christmas day, my wife wanted a family trip to the cinema, and we chose ""Ballad etc"" because we enjoyed the original films starring Jennifer Lawrence and Donald Sutherland. And, for the record, it's a good and enjoyable movie. The performances of most of the cast members are terrific, there are a handful of highly memorable action sequences, a few remarkable twists & gimmicks, and a plot that is compelling despite often being convoluted.Remember the almighty Sutherland as the relentless and tyrannical President Snow? Well, this movie goes 64 years back in time, to when Coriolanus Snow was a hunky 19-year-old student at Capitol Academy and about to witness the announcement of an innovative new rule for the upcoming 10th edition of the annual Hunger Games. The most prominent academy students are obliged to mentor the participants from the different districts from now onwards, and Snow gets assigned to the seemingly fragile District-12 girl Lucy Grey Baird.The screenplay is neatly divided in three chapters. The Mentor is about the acquaintance between young Snow and Lucy Grey. The Prize revolves around the actual Hunger Games that still integrally take place in the arena. And then The Peacekeeper about Snow's banishment from the Capitol, his dubious adventures in District-12, and his further mental descent into darkness. Although every chapter contains multiple highlights and tension-peaks, they each should have been a bit shorter. It must be said, the film owes a lot of its impact and power to the performance of Tom Blyth as the charismatic and emotionally versatile Snow. I read a lot of harsh comments about the performance of Rachel Zegler, but I didn't think she was too bad. Could have done without the singing, admittedly.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ghoult-58762","28 December 2023","Book to movie adaptations have a habit of cutting out character development and worldbuilding, which is to be expected due to time constraints. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem if they hadn't decided to completely erase some of the MAIN characters. The few people mentioned by name in the movie were rewritten to the point that it makes their characters seem like entirely different people. In the books, Coriolanus Snow is a sociopath who is downright evil and worships his father, who is basically American Hitler. In the movies, he comes off as sympathetic. The directors rewrote lines, added lines, added scenes, deleted scenes, and threw stuff around until they made a jumbled-up mess of the original. It's like the director and writers read the plot points on SparkNotes instead actually reading the book. Out of all the movies I've seen, this one was one of the biggest letdowns. There are so many fans who have waited so long for this movie. Money is not the problem. And neither is time, considering people have waited this many years already. Either Suzanne Collins did not have the ability to offer much input for this movie or she did not care to correct them. Because this movie is a hot mess. Spectacularly terrible adaptation.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","zawally","25 November 2023","The latest Hunger Games installment introduced a captivating concept, but its execution left much to be desired. Unexpectedly, certain scenes carried a whimsical Disney musical vibe, a stark departure from the series' gritty tone. The depiction of arena deaths fell disappointingly flat, lacking the visceral impact that defined the franchise. Moreover, the CGI work was subpar, failing to immerse the audience effectively.However, the film wasn't without its merits. A standout feature was the commendable ensemble cast, with each actor bringing a nuanced performance. Yet, some talents were sadly underutilized, leaving viewers wanting more from characters who had the potential for greater depth and development.One major flaw that overshadowed the positives was the rushed pacing of the narrative. The movie struggled to explore the intricacies of its intriguing concept thoroughly. A more deliberate approach, possibly as a two-part installment, could have allowed for a more immersive and satisfying exploration of the dystopian world.Despite its shortcomings, the film managed to maintain a semblance of the franchise's essence. The core themes of rebellion, survival, and sacrifice were present, but the execution failed to capture the intensity that fans expected. In essence, the latest Hunger Games installment had all the ingredients for success, but its hasty execution prevented it from reaching the heights of its predecessors.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","AfricanBro","19 November 2023","A reoccurring thought throughout the movie for me was It felt like a movie plot that was so easy to sell. If they had to convince studio executives to green light the movie, or convince the actors to take the role. Describing the plot to someone makes it more interesting than the movie actually was. It somehow just doesn't culminate into something special.I was, in the slightest sense, excited for this because I'm a sucker for dystopian films. Starts off very dark and gloomy, depicting a war torn landscape and giving off an aura similar to that of the original hunger games movies. However we get to see this from a different perspective from those, we get to see it from inside the Capitol. I think it's good that it's made by the same people, so it felt consistent with the franchise. World building was great visually speaking, you still get the same classism and hierarchy and politics, but now from the inside. Not from the victims eyes but oppressors.Feels more more of an introduction to this world than I expected it to be, because we already knew the premise of these movies. I think it could've been better showing us the inaugural hunger games, not the 10th.I think it could've worked better if it didn't have a lead role, instead of it being Snow's background/origin story, (which I don't think was necessary) it could've been the hunger games themself's origin story. They were already a thing at this point. Loved seeing the origin of the ""hanging tree"" song though.They could've given Rachel Zeglar more to do, it felt like all they wrote her to do was sing. Oh she sings here, she sings there, she sings everywhere. Felt more repetitive than impactful (maybe it's because I'm not the biggest musical lover lol). Viola Davis was great, you can put her character up there with Amanda Wallis, just insane cold hearted characters. I wonder what happens with her Dr Volumnia Gaul character in the future. Peter Dinklage didn't have as much time as I expected but he made the most of it. Acting was great throughout the cast. Burn Gorman shows up in the last act, seems like he's made for such type of roles also. Type casting.I wish they didn't shy away from the gore and violence, but it was pg13 and action was still decent. It's not as quick paced but it's okay. Never had me at the edge of my seat as I expected. The one thing that actually annoyed me was there were so many moments when I was literally screaming ""run"" at the characters and they took so long to react.It is pretty long, but a lot happens to fill up the time. I liked that they divided it. The crappy thing is knowing that Snow survives, removes some thrill from it.I think it should've been better and more captivating. They had enough material to work with but it's just not as exciting. The characters weren't as easy to root for, I thought Rachel zeglar was great and did the most she could've done; but I just didn't feel taken in by her the way Jennifer Lawrence made katniss. She wasn't someone to root for and felt forgettable. It felt like they could've given her more to work with.Tom Blyth's portrayal of Snow was excellent, yet knowing the eventual transformation of the character into a tyrant in the future might have impacted the viewing experience. The attempt by the writers to hint at this evolution felt inconsistent with the character's present age and personality. It might have been more effective if they depicted him as a villainous, power-hungry individual masquerading as good, or just straight up good and thrown all their eggs in that basket. Instead, the portrayal fluctuated between moments of genuine goodness, power-hungry actions, and conflicting motivations. At times, he prioritized his family, while at others, he pursued power or seemed invested in his affection for Lucy Gray. The character's motivations seemed muddled, making it challenging for the narrative to balance these conflicting traits effectively.It wasn't the rise of snow, it was just his childhood, but they still wanted us to see the Snow we knew, if this was a trilogy I'd assume they couldve shown us the evil side of him in the sequel. That could've better and more easily shown good character development and arc, while it felt too squeezed in here.The movie is broken up into three parts and you'd expect them to be building up to something, but the last third is dull. Doesn't get better the more you watch it. And how it was separated made it feel like i was binge watching a series, which I think would've been a better adaptation than a movie. Someone said it felt like two movies in one because they were unsure of a sequel could happen.I think it's an okay entry to the hunger games franchise, it's a decent foundation for sequels but it just feels like it wasn't made the best it could've. It feels like an unnecessary reboot. It's not too bad but it's pretty far from being anything special, just lingers around being little better than mediocre for me. However I am still excited of what they can do from here with the sequels.","

In his role he is just brilliant, so thanks for at least his performance.The casting for Snow was also not bad, but the rest of the actors can be forgotten. Above all, we couldn't stand the calling of 'Lucy Gray' after what felt like the 100th time.We're generally not big fans of singing in movies, but these songs were placed so tactlessly that it felt like imitating a Disney film. The only suspenseful part is in the last section of the movie - precisely when it ends.! It seems like the whole movie is made for teenagers. Overexplained and repetitive scenes dominate.

As a result, a relatively boring movie. It felt as though there was so much context to provide there was no time to make it enjoyable. Some exciting parts but this was only attributable to Suzanne Collins' writing; I believe the directors heavily relied on the plot already written for them. Rachel exaggerated jaw acting made this not only a boring watch but a difficult one. Lucy Gray was a textbook manic pixie dream girl - I thought cinema would be more self aware by now.","

I actually fell asleep in the theater for the first time in my life, and that's what compelled me to write this. I understand the importance of singing to the story, but it doesn't match the tone of the movie AT ALL. We're just bursting out into song like it's a 2010 Disney channel movie. I feel like I got whiplash every time she started singing because of how wrong it is for the tone of this film. Additionally, I felt embarrassed for the actors during several of the dramatic scenes leading up to the games. And then you get to the actual games...I don't know that I've ever seen a film with such an unearned display of violence. It's genuinely brutal. I normally applaud a film that has the balls to kill a kid. It's usually unexpected, and when done well, it creates incredible tension. In this movie, you're expecting kids to die, which somehow just adds to how distasteful the actual violence is. It's completely unearned. We've had random singing, terrible dramatic acting, scenes that feel like TikTok fan fiction, and everyone in the capital is twirling their moustache like a Bond villain. Whether the writers like it or not, this movie is WAY too campy to allow for this kind of brutal violence and social metaphor.I don't even really want to get into the last 45 minutes, or whatever it was. The main guy acts like a sociopath the entire film, and we know who he becomes, so I don't feel I'm spoiling anything by saying that he continues to be a sociopath, and everyone acts accordingly. And it's boring, and confusing. So its boring until it's violent, and then it's boring again, with a little bit of pointless confusion sprinkled on top.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","jace_the_film_guy","27 December 2023","As someone who enjoyed the original ""Hunger Games"" films, this movie was a trip back to a world I fondly remember. The direction, the score and the set/costume design are all reminiscent of the original movies. There was an anxious energy pulsing throughout the film, which made me think of Katniss, Peeta and the events that unfold 64 years in the future.The bond between the two leads in palpable, with both Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler) mirroring each other. Across the board, the characters were fascinating and had a depth to their motivations. This film is the origin story of a villain, and the filmmakers do not shy away from that fact.As is the case with many film adaptations of movies, some of the dialogue was a little stiff and ""book-ish"". Like the original books/movies, a lot of the names are outlandish and hard to remember; Coriolanus, Volumnia and Sejanus to name a few. While this doesn't detract from the film, it does take a minute to get used to some of the verbiage.A lot happens in the 2-hour 37-minute runtime of this movie. I'm not usually an advocate for breaking a film into two parts, but it might have been appropriate in this case. By the end of the second act, it felt like the story was wrapping up, only to have 53 minutes left to go. Wisely, the film uses title cards to break up the story into three acts (i.e., Part I: The Mentor) which helps with the pacing.Recently, there have been many attempts by big studios to revitalize beloved franchises. Most of these attempts have not met much critical acclaim (i.e., ""Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them""). This film is an outlier to that negative trend and feels like a story that needed to be told, rather than a cash-grab. The plot is thought-provoking and well-conceived, the characters are intriguing, and I left the theater wanting to re-watch the franchise again.Best Character: Coriolanus

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ThereelscoopwithKK","23 November 2023","There's a lot to like about this movie, but it just doesn't hit the same way the original Hunger Games did. At many points in the movie there seems to be an opportunity to look deeper into the psyche that drives Snow, but instead they only explore it at the surface level. Not sure yet if it's the script or the actor just didn't have the ability to deliver it.Viola Davis for me had the standout performance. She owned her character and was able to create the evil eery feeling of the Panem totalitarian state that the other characters weren't as successful in portraying as the original films. On the other side of things, Peter Dinklage seemed disinterested and didn't really offer much in his role.The overall filming quality and shots are quite good but of course a huge appeal to the Hunger games is seeing the stadium and for obvious reasons this one is a lot more basic than in previous movies.Hunger Games had a good run but I'm afraid the appeal/ interest of it has worn off a little bit over the years .","

I appreciate it's a long film but that's because they were trying to do too much all in one film. Some of the actors were over the top and theatrical rather than displaying substance which was surprising considering the big names in this movie. Some big names in this film yet they disappointed us as they really felt to of lacked depth. I've seen them in films where they have been truly astounding yet they fell flat here. I can't help but wonder if it's because of how rushed this was, you didn't have time to become invested in any of the characters. The previous hunger games reallly felt powerful and hit a nerve, this felt showy and lacking in depth. On a positive note I liked the singing and the female lead, I just wish they given her more time to provide suspense in many moments instead of rushing through.

I think it's poorly thought out and I don't think that's what it was were asking - at least some fans of the saga.A mess, with a somewhat forced message.There are many technical and casting points that could have been suppressed, but I think the biggest problem - I think - was the rush to make something and release it quickly for the world to ""consume"".Quickly and well, there is no one.This may serve as a lesson for future attempts.I just regret the lost time.","

I blame Tik-Tok.Nobody cares about a lot of details if they think this movie works. I feel kinda sad that they think this is enough. It brings down a whole lot of headway storytelling in film made along the years. It is like going back 30-40 years when plot holes were common in film and often overlooked. But this is not kind of movie, is it? It wants to be more elevated than that.Oh, and the acting sucked. And from the good actors, the acting was camp a.f.. and what is with all the singing?? Seems justified only because Zegler was doing it. That's it.","

How can they call this a Hunger Games prequel?? It gave no insight into the world of the Hunger Games and instead left me feeling confused, annoyed and quite frankly sad. This was some kind of Taylor Swift love story musical set in the world of the Hunger Games but with no real connection to the characters we have previously come to love and admire. As we were watching the movie people actually started walking out of the theater ....THAT's how bad it was. AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON THE SINGING AND SCRIPT. In conclusion, do not see this movie.","

That means you have to have seen the other movies too. This being a prequel - I assume you have seen the other Hunger Games movies, but this is the extent of me mentioning them - well going into details.Let me add that there are a few things in this (not just characters) that carry over. Some are connected to people in the new (old) movies and we also get to see origin stuff (how did that came to be and so forth). The acting is really good, the story is tight and the Games are just one small part of the whole thing. Actually you may be surprised about how much other stuff is being done and talked about. Winter may not be coming yet, but Snow is here ... and he is here to stay (well and go ... and come back ... and stuff like that! As always no pun intended here either).If you liked the other movies you will find something in this one too. I am not sure if this is based on a novel too (not just the characters, but the story overall), so as you can tell, I can not give you any scoop on how accurate it is to the writers vision ... maybe it's better to watch without any preconception of things anyway (?)","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","diversecleaning","21 December 2023","The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes was a very good book, however, the film falls flat. Despite the 2 hours and 37 minute run time the story is rushed and relationships/plotlines were not developed.The romance between Snow and Lucy was developed slowly yet deeply in the book and their relationship made sense. In the film you have to use your imagination (go figure) to see how the two could have fallen for each other in such a short period of time. There was absolutely no chemistry between the actors in the film and their casting was terrible.In the book, Lucy is extremely likeable and Snow's motives are developed with much more depth. In the film, Lucy is underwhelming at best and not likeable more often than not.The voice actor whom sings in the audiobook does wonderful renditions of the songs in the film, which leads the films versions to be very disappointing.Sejanus was annoying in the book but was a likeable character, in the film Sejanus is just annoying.The casting/acting were terrible in this film. I half expected to find out that this was the director's first film and that the casting director was an intern.Lastly, Maude Ivory was a truly missed opportunity. Maude Ivory in the book was so cute and likeable yet in the film she is just someone onscreen.","

It plods along at a snails pace, and nothing ever happens.The acting is shocking even in it's best moments, you would think it's a cast of child actors with how hammy and fake their reactions are. The lead woman is just shockingly bad, almost like she is loading emotions when needed and you can see the loading times. Her random bursting into auto tuned song was so weird too. It never made sense, she just randomly sings and for some reason that saves the day every time.The leading male does an ok job but again not enough to say it's good enough.And eesh the story is just nothing at all. It's a movie where start to finish, absolutely nothing happens or has impact other than the 3 heavily focused maguffins which might as well have big neon signs pointing at them that they will shortly be used to move the glacial plot forwards.This feels like they googled a few key words from the originals and just crowbarred them into this abysmal movie. You can happily live your life as a hunger games fan having never seen this tripe.","

It seems many criticisms people are writing about this movie are simply due to individuals not understanding/processing the plot of the film and making judgments based on a lack of comprehension.This movie is a worthy addition to the Hunger Games franchise, satisfying the one question I had coming into it: Why is Snow such a psychopath?Additionally, we get to see another (old fashioned) Hunger Games which we've been waiting for, for nearly a decade!Having not read the book before seeing this film, it really enlightened me to information surrounding the society of Panem that I was previously unaware of / ignorant to.Not a perfect film, but a very good one nonetheless. 8.5/10 at least!

The characters are bland and most of them annoying , especially Lucy Gray who starts singing out of the blue every step of the way.I think the only likeable characters are Tigris who has little to almost no screen time and Sejanus who acts like a moral compass throughout the movie and who was done dirty. Otherwise I wasn't rooting for anyone .I kinda regret starting the movie but I wanted to give it a try. Now I want to finish it on principle because I hate living movies and shows unfinished not because I like it in any shape of form.It's a pity because its such a downgrade compared to the previous Hunger Games. The only good thing in this movie is Viola Davis who is spectacular as always ... other than that nope, nothing.","

2- hunger games used to be fought in visually pleasing environments, this one was in a dark theatre??

4- characters development sucked big time, didn't feel a thing for anyone of them

Their work stinks, and the director put the final nail in the coffin.This is the sort of movie one would expect from one's teenage son after gifting him his first camcorder and clapperboard combo. Little Jimmy went off to play with his friends and came back with this rubbish.The actors should seek alternative employment, and the producers should just move to Florida and forget all about life. As for the audio people, they seem a lost cause entirely. The audio quality of this movie was terrible. Don't studios that invest millions of dollars in movies check for basics such as the sound quality?This is another movie that puts me off new movies. I'm just going to watch old black and white flicks for a while, and I'll check back on the new stuff after the bad memory of this rot has faded a bit, and in the hope that Hollywood has past its dead years and has started making movies worth watching again.

But I will say that for a singing audition this film worked and that's about all. It was disjunctured for the most part often making absolutely no sense whatsoever many times. Plus the whole premise for the plot was never clearly defined. Additionally, there were some major fopauxs with some of the CG.

Lucy from District 12 can't fight to save herself. Hides most of the movie and ends up being the winner. Once she wins, there what feels like a hour left to the movie where nothing important happens.

The dialogue was so confusing, and the characters made no sense. Every scene something didn't make quite sense. Wether it was a characters reaction, or his motives. And it doesn't help that the main character is so stupid to look at. It seemed like they tried to make him look complex all the time or cynical, but he just ended up being really unrelatable. But probably the thing that annoyed me the most was the chapter thing. Why did they make it in to three chapters, when the ""chapters"" just blend into eachother. Maybe the gap between chapter 2 and 3 made sense, because that he was transferred. But the chapter 3 screen was so short, that it didn't seem as if, we were going to a new chapter of the story. Because the new chapter just started so quickly. The movie also tried so much to be a kind of masterpiece, but that didn't work either.","

Everything is either poorly done or then very overacted, over dramatic and pompous. Starting from acting, to costumes, to special effect, writing, everything, it was either poor or mediocre. It felt like I was watching an over length episode of a lousy stream series which is cancelled after the first season due to poor view ratings. Then some extra things like musical style singing to reflect the story with dramatic fashion was totally overacting and way too overdramatic. Just an example of weird decision to add extra drama into the movie. Everything felt so out of the place.Other reviews have also mentioned that the scenes were loosely connected. I also felt it was like that. Not to mention that it was very difficult to follow what really this movie is about. The story is so confusing. I had no idea after the movie that what the districts are there fore, what is the Capitol, what are these mean looking soldiers and how they fit into the concept of Capitol, what these hungergames are really for and so on. The amount of open questions was like vast. Then the sheer amount of talking with completely meaningless dialogue. Oh my God.After the second part, the movie is split into parts by the way, I was completely lost that what the story in the movie is actually all about. Then some story lines are concluded with super lame fashion. Just suddenly something is happening just for some reason to kill the characters so that the storyline can be concluded.This kind of movie makes me really think that how the movie industry is going so wrong with big budget movies. Somehow I believe that at 80s or 90s with this budget, people at the industry would had made something way much better. In this movie, there is virtually nothing spectacular, nothing to see explicitly at the cinema. This movie is a total filler into stream service catalog what you may watch into some point at home and then just close the movie because it's so lousy. Maybe stream services are killing the cinema industry inside out. Who knows...","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","arsalanweb","23 December 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" had the potential to be a compelling addition to the franchise, but unfortunately, it fails to live up to the expectations set by its predecessors. While it attempts to delve into the origins of the Hunger Games and the character of President Snow, the execution leaves much to be desired.One of the major drawbacks of the film is the pacing. The narrative feels sluggish, with long stretches of monotony that test the audience's patience. The attempt to build a complex character in President Snow falls short, as the film struggles to make him a sympathetic or even intriguing figure. Instead, he comes across as one-dimensional, lacking the depth and complexity that would have added layers to the story.The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes also suffers from a lack of emotional resonance. Unlike its predecessors, this installment fails to evoke the same level of empathy for the characters or a genuine connection to the dystopian world of Panem. The emotional beats feel forced, and the stakes don't seem as high, making it difficult for the audience to become fully invested in the unfolding events.Furthermore, the film's visual and cinematic elements are a letdown. The special effects and action sequences, which were once a highlight of the Hunger Games series, appear lackluster and uninspired in this installment. The film's visual style lacks the innovative flair that made the previous entries stand out, contributing to a sense of mediocrity.While some may appreciate the attempt to explore the darker corners of the Hunger Games universe, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying cinematic experience. It's a forgettable addition to the franchise, lacking the intensity and impact that made the original films so memorable. Fans of the Hunger Games series may find themselves disappointed by this lackluster ballad that, unfortunately, falls flat.","

Honestly, that is a big factor of the book that is missing. The love for the character. Personally, I really feel as Rachel's current controversies and backlash going on in the world.

I'm a big hunger games fan, and granted I haven't read the book, the movie was really dull. I don't know whether the book was depicting the same thing or not but I thought that Rachel's perfomance carried no emotion at all. She didn't make me care for the character at all. She's also surprinsingly close to Katniss with mannerisms, which ended up looking like a cheap cosplay rather than anything. Also, having her breaking into songs every 20mins, which imo didn't add anything to the movie half the time just made this even duller.The small arena part felt somewhat useless, almost like it wasn't part of the movie, few kills, then just hiding away defenceless and winning solely by breaking into song? Lmao.Also, it might just be me but having ""Lucy grey"" shouted every 5mins, without any alterations like just ""Lucy"" or ""miss Grey"" I don't know, it just got on my nerves a little bit, especially in the last scene with the trees.I have a hard time understanding why a film with quite a good cast felt so numb. It didn't feel useful at all. It felt like a fan made rendition of the hunger games with a high budget. It felt rushed, unfinished, unpolished.

Not being based on a book of course I didn't know what it really was about going in. How disappointed I was.The story is about President Snow in his youth and no one could want to learn about the most hated character in the original series. Who cares what he did growing up and why he became a monster? No one. It was also made in a cheap romance setting that never would fly in the books, which immediately lost my interest.The main protagonist was well acted and semi interesting, but she wasn't given interesting material to run with, so our engagement into her character was greatly reduced. This felt like a Twilight remake without vampires, which is fine for kids, but appeals to no one else. The big named actors were wasted and the pacing was so slow I honestly wasn't sure I was going to make it through.My only hope is this doesn't become a series if movies, because this story didn't need to be told at all.","

I only wish that it focused more on this and not the interpersonal relationships Snow formed, relationships which had little to no impact on the story beyond just serving as plot devices to move the narrative forward.I wish the capital was explored more as well as the victors who won the war. None of this is explored beyond mere references that we already know about from the trilogy.Overall, the movie is an average attempt at revisiting the lore of The Hunger Games.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","channellius","27 November 2023","I watched this in the cinema with my younger sisters yesterday, all of us having reasonably enjoyed the Hunger Games books and bits of the movie series before this.I think there were a lot of nice points about this movie - the setting felt pretty believable, the acting was generally good... but I think the story itself was a bit weak, and for some reason I was really turned off by all the singing bits.In terms of the story, it was fascinating seeing the main character grapple with his concepts of what he knew was right and wrong, and what FELT right and wrong to him, but I think the female lead didn't really have any real development or much actual likeability - she felt like a pasted classic ""good folk girl"" kind of character, except for setting snakes on people?? I didn't really sense much chemistry with her and Snow's characters, because it didn't seem like they even any notable spent time together, and her disappearance at the end, leaving the snake to attack him, felt so strange. Why did she waste time setting up a nasty trick like that, if it wasn't going to kill him, and serve just to slow her escape down, and also make him hate her? Was she just trying to make some kind of risky point? I don't know, it just didn't really make sense to me.And the singing... I can't say exactly what bothered me about it, but it just felt weird. I found the singing scenes long and kind of painful - I guess it didn't feel like someone in that setting sincerely singing, but someone from 2023 singing for a 2023 movie and pretending to add a folk kind of twang to it. She's a great singer, I'm not denying that, but it didn't feel like it fit with the setting somehow.Overall, I guess the movie was somewhat interesting, though I wouldn't say ""enjoyable"". I wouldn't recommend it to friends, but maybe the book's pacing is better? I don't expect I'll be reading it though, unfortunately.","

And the hunger game fights itself was boring. I was a fan of the first movies, and even though they were never oscar worthy, they were entertaining. I loved Katniss so much I even named my Cat , Katniss. Maybe include people from other districts (3rd world countries) when making such movies, to add depth to the story. The characters lack soul, and even the one that shouldn't have a soul was one-dimentional. It had so much potential. It's a good story that was not givin cinematic justice.

I haven't kept it a secret that I wasn't particularly enamored with the filmmaking in those original entries, however, the way they crafted their world easily outshines any equivalent effort here. District 12 was a tactile place, where the hardships and inequality could be seen and sensed, especially when contrasted with the Capitol, which felt properly different. In Ballad (not writing that title in full), it wouldn't be remiss to assume these two places aren't fundamentally distinct. Yes, the Capitol is technologically more advanced and has the structure of a sprawling, concrete city, but you don't feel that. The outside world is never emphasized, and as such, apart from the mustache-twirling villainy of the Capitol population, it doesn't distinguish itself from the 'lower' districts. From all that you can gather here, District 12 is comprised of an industrial complex with surrounding plains, and the most we ever see of civilian life in here is a crowd at a bar having a pretty good time. This is very much a problem when you consider how the driving force in much of the characterization is the moral push-and-pull some figures from the Capitol are experiencing. According to some, there are pressing matters of inequality and injustice that need to be addressed; yet we don't see much of what those issues are supposed to entail outside of some troopers being nazis. Those troopers are in the Capitol too, and usually enforce their policies fiercely, even in that environmental - again, no palpable basis of inequality is established.The Hunger Games themselves are also, to quote Gaul here, ""dull, dull, dull..."". The nonsensical and often arbitrary construction of the Games in the originals always bothered me, but at the very least they made for some engaging scenarios. Here, you have to thank those rebels for messing up the battlefield, or this would've been even more uninteresting than the repetitive forest: you get some stone, some marble, and a bit of debris. Enjoy looking at that for a while. The action does help elicit something visceral out of this bland arena, utilizing some lengthier takes to assist in providing a proper sense of space during the frantic fights - but outside of these specific scenarios this is not eager to do anything of equivalent value with the camera. The sense of space is even lost in the arena itself, where, despite its simple structure, the positions of the tributes are consistently unclear. Do they just disappear, or are they wandering about in a place we've not been shown?I have no clue how well the book is written - and I wouldn't use that knowledge to judge this adaptation, anyway - but this is stuffed to the brim with story beats that come off as bafflingly unmotivated aside from their presence on the preexisting pages, dots to be connected with no need to consider how and why these junctions work (assuming they did in the book). Especially in a character study this is a major issue: if I can't grasp someone's reasoning or motivation, it's hard to understand and connect to them. It felt as if Snow was simply hopping from one side of his moral quarrel to the other, which is a shame, because I take a liking to these gray areas (in particular in this instance because the Capitol is otherwise an utterly one-dimensional antagonistic force).There are some beacons of light to be found, mainly in the practical sets and some of the performances: Davis is delightfully diabolical, Schwartzman consistently hits his comedic marks and Zegler gets plenty of opportunities to use her vocal chords (and if you get second-hand embarrassment during song in a film you're boring, by the way). The whole thing is just entertaining enough - as you might hope from a blockbuster - but not enough to distract from its glaring problems. Ultimately pointless and unsatisfying - in other words, another Hunger Games film.","

District 12 is way more lively than it should be, and they are dressed way too well after the games.Lucie Gray actress is acting like a cold robot. On paper she's doing really well, but she's missing emotion and soul when acting. Also, what's going on with her jaw, is she on cocaine?The pacing is too fast and the game was unrealistic, nobody could have survived that. They barely show District 12 and we're supposed to care for them?Recent american cinema is missing the mark on so many movies big time. It's time they stop recycling actors in all their movies.Not a movie I would recomment, 4/10, below average.The only good thing about this movie is the set design.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","hrekkjavaka","24 November 2023","Absolutely the weakest instalment in the series and mostly that's down to Rachel Zegler's rigid staring-into-the-mid-distance acting and incessant singing. The story is ok, I mean it's Snow's origin story mixed in with what seems to be unremarkable filler. There are some good moments, few and far between, I was feeling pretty bored half way in and was hoping it would end, but no, it goes on... and on. Overall the dialogue is pretty rigid and unnatural, the plot is a bit of a mess, the acting is pretty bad from most - Rachel Zeglar especially cannot act. It might have been passable if they'd replaced her with someone who didn't do a Zoey Deschanel staring gurn all the damn time. Poor and missable, if you have over two hours of spare time my advice is watch something else.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","judywalker2","29 November 2023","I enjoyed the original Hunger Games movies and especially since I thought President Snow was one of the most interesting characters. I didn't read any of the books, so I didn't compare the movies to them. But I hope that the book this movie is based on was better than what was presented. My major beef is that the characterization of Snow gave us zero insight into what made him what he was in the future. The acting is good, but the characters are mostly unlikeable. Things are just thrown in without any thought to cohesiveness. Yes, the actress who plays Lucy Gray can sing and the atmosphere was definitely reflective of the capital and the districts, but for the most part the story and Snow were hollow. Just average to bad entertainment.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ghgaskins","26 December 2023","A musical Hunger Games? Viola Davis is embarrassed by this one. She should remove her name from the credits. If this aligns to the book, then it is written to cash in on a previous innovative story. Now it's full of its own cliche's and makes one think the original story didn't age well. Maybe it could have been better with real headliner actors as the main characters vs supporting roles. Peter Dinkledge proved he couldn't carry this one despite him being the only interesting character. They should try this one again because it is either too serious or too dramatic. There are no heroes and the singing is a distraction despite being good music. It just isn't appropriate to the story.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","AreSee5454","22 December 2023","This movie was just not good.Pros:
+ Great casting for Snow.+ Great way of ""showing"" the evolution of the Games.+ Shows why the Capital was angry at the Districts.Cons:
Tries too hard to insert all this nostalgia and/or trying to connect to the future films in such a forced or disingenuous way. (ex: Katniss bow, the swamp potato scene, the on the nose Hanging Tree song to the final act - BTW, to me, the way Lucy sings her original songs throughout the movie is in a different rhythm).Introduction to Lucy in the Reaping really asks you put your suspension of disbelief into overdrive.Lucy (made to be a gypsy like person) looked too well off.Never explains why the Snows are poor even though the father was a great general and was ""part"" of the creation of the Games. You'd think he'd get some retroactive wealth for all his contributions.What was the point of Dr. Gaul's character? The Games were straight forward, so I don't know how the mad scientist plays a part. Remember, snakes only came to play because of an important Capital citizens death.Movie just seems disjointed in many places (ex: Hob bar scene in the backroom).","

I was aware that this film was going to be a more dialogue heavy kind of thing but it was just unbearable. The pacing was awful and it just went on for so long. I'm fine with movies on the longer side but not when you're forced to sit there and watch paint dry for 60% of the movie. I also did not care about any of the characters or their well being. I had no reason to feel emotionally attached to any of them. By all means do what you want and check it out but for me it was a huge yawn. I wanted to walk out of the theater but I sat through it all unfortunately.","

The ONLY somewhat exciting part was the Hunger Games scenes where they fought each other and that's about it. Also, I feel like halfway in through the movie, they didn't quite know what to do with Snow's character and near the end realizing... ""Wait... This guy is supposed to be evil! Let's turn him heel in the last 20 minutes after 2+ hours of seeing him as a bad guy.""Honestly it was so stupid. They should've just stopped at the end of the main Hunger Games franchise and called it a day. Why they decided to capitalize off of that franchise with whatever this was, is a disgrace. Therefore, this for me is a below average Hunger Games movie.","

I really wanted to leave the cinema, and would have if I hadn't come for once with my daughters.Once half way you start hoping: ""ah finally the last plot twist, now the movie can stop... "" and then a new story starts, totally new, out of the blue, little to do with what happened before, they could have gone in 50 directions, and just picked one, for fun of spending money on making movies or so? What a waste of my time and money...
The main actress even sings up to 3 or 5 times the same song, you'd think it has become a musical, but no no, that was just another plot twist.After a while your only hope is to see some nice fighting scenes, but even there the movie disappoints...
I try to find one positive aspect... well, maybe the fashion, the clothes... I appreciated it, or at least considered it ""interesting""...","

I haven't seen a movie in a while that stays with me outside the cinema and makes me think about the events in it.It's unpredictable, and the ending is genius because it excludes the basic happy ending and immerses you in the life and feelings of the main character.

The movie had great promise with the idea of a backstory of Snow but the need up turning into some corny Disney musical.I get they tried to show the betrayal that turned Snow into what we was but forcing a quick love story just made it that much harder to watch. The only time me and the family woudk get remotely excited was when they would reference something from the other films.Had so much promise in the beginning but I truly do feel like it ended with the singing. The acting was horrible as well. We couldn't stand watching Zegler for some reason would just get under our skin.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","cinelove93","22 November 2023","I watched Catching Fire right after seeing the newest Hunger Games movie and it made me realise what I was missing in it. The emotions. The OG cast gave stellar performances, eveybody was cast perfectly and conveyed what their characters were going through. The Ballad felt somewhat empty. None of the characters were compelling enough. I found Lucy Gray to be too perfect, her relationship with Snow was rushed and lacked depth. The supporting performances were also mediocre, nowhere near as good as Haymitch, Effie or even tributes like Rue. In a minute of watching Catching Fire I felt more emotions than in the whole Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. It's unfortunate since that's where the strength of this movie should have lied. It is obvious that the games themselves aren't that entertaining to the audience anymore after watching the trilogy. Therefore, Ballad had a lot of potential for character development and conveying the story, the relationships between characters and the chemistry between them in the end...just wasn't there.","

And sure it will bring in enough money that the makes will call themselves justified.The only decent sequels came from Tolkien's LOTR. The script was good, the acting was good, the sets were good, the cinematography was good. Though Peter Jackson went overboard on the script at times but what he produced was worth watching.They should have stopped with the first film.

There are no motivation, dialogues or at least logic.When I was watching first two parts - I really thought i like it. But then third one has started...
One of the problem - Snow hasn't changed during the whole movie. As he was egocentric, ready to lie for a purpose - as he is in the end, despite the script trying to hide it - doesn't work at all.Lucy Gray: not so bad as a character. The only thing I didn't like - in the very beginning where she accidentally started to sing - complete disaster, nobody believed that character really can behave like this.","

I love the gritty, pure and raw four movies, especially the first two.This movie feels more like a cheap rom-com that happens to be set in Panem. Zegler is an insufferable pick-me girl that sings like the popular girl at your high school play. I know it says ballad in the title but that does not justify the commercial musical songs that are thrown in there to distract from plotholes.Blythe gets way too much screen time and nevertheless the character development from nice guy to evil Snow falls down from the sky like a dead mockingbird.It's a painful watch that made audience sitting around me cringe at their kissing scenes, because it all seems forced and chemistry is lacking.And why did the make up department decide to give Zegler a YouTuber 2014 Glam Up ? A girl from District 12, come you all can do better.This is nowhere near the previous movies. The extras did well though, a better performance than most actors.","

However, what the prequel presents feels shallow, rushed, and unsatisfying. This film is still interesting in terms of visuals, action scenes, characters (especially Tom Blyth as Coriolanus Snow and Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray Baird) and the brutalist architectural setting of The Capitol. The Ballad may not be as good as the Hunger Games trilogy but it quite stands out among the franchise and of course Rachel Zegler can sing.","

The focus on a handful of songs over a prolonged duration made it feel disjointed and detracted from the core theme of the Hunger Games. Instead of delving into the gritty, survivalist aspects that the series is known for, the film centers almost entirely on two characters, whose storylines overshadow the broader narrative of the Hunger Games. This shift in focus and genre may disappoint fans who were anticipating the high-stakes action and intense drama typical of the Hunger Games saga.","

Then I saw it was released, and just decided to go see because why not. I hadn't seen any trailers and knew nothing about it, just that it was based on a new book by Suzanne Collins.I had absolutely zero expectations, although the cynical part of me thought I might be wasting my time, especially after seeing the runtime on the movie. However, 3 hours later I can admit I left the cinema feeling rather impressed. I genuinely enjoyed it.While the hunger games trilogy we know with Katniss Everdeen strike me as a fun, rewatchable teen-fantasy, in the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, we see a much darker and grittier side of the world of Panem, which I felt resulted in experiencing a much more horrifying reality of the games themselves. It felt more real, and grounded, and loved seeing how everything operated with far more inferior technology and fewer established rules.Since watching the movie I've seen criticism of the characters and acting, and while I am usually quite strict on that kind of thing too, I genuinely see their points here. I understand Rachel Zegler is an actress of controversy for a lot of people, I myself have seen a lot of debatable interviews with her, but I believe she shows of her talent here with a great performance. The standout performance is definitely Tom Blyth and a young president Snow however, an actor who I have not seen in anything else before. I found myself genuinely caring about the fate of the two characters and their relationship, which is a hard thing to achieve, and i feel is the core element of this movie, therefore really enjoyed because of it. The supporting characters were also well performed, such as Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis.The movie is split into three chapters, like a book. Chapters 1 and 2 are certainly the stronger of the three, which I very much enjoyed for reasons already stated. Despite still enjoying chapter 3, and completely recognising it's importance, I feel as though it was slightly rushed, and therefore perhaps would be understood more by people who have read the book and have pre-existing knowledge of the hunger games.Although certainly not a flawless movie, I am pleasantly surprised by it and had a fun time watching. I would recommend if you fancy a movie night. 7.5/10.","

It's definitely too long, but at the same time manages to make you feel like the second part of it is too short and should be extended. I feel like it should be separated into two movies. One about the 10th Hunger Games and the rise of Snow (this doesn't really need much more, that the first hour and a half of this movie) and another one about how he turned from an ambitious boy in love to a overambitious manipulator and tyrant (this one definitely needs more time and depth).The most frustrating thing about the new Hunger Games movie is that literally every element of it is interesting, but still none of them is really well done and fulfills its potential. The main character is interesting, writers try to make him deep, they almost succed, but then they don't have enough time to finish the job, cause the movie cannot be even longer than it actually is.In the end, I feel so much wasted potential that it makes me angry, even thought I'm not really emotionally invested in the franchise.","

Despite high expectations, the film fails to capture the essence of Suzanne Collins' gripping trilogy, leaving audiences yearning for the intensity and emotional depth that defined the source material.From the moment the opening credits begin, it becomes painfully evident that Rachel Zegler's Hunger Games is marred by a sea of cringe-worthy performances that even the most forgiving viewer will struggle to overlook. The cast, including Zegler herself, delivers a collective display of wooden acting that undermines the gravity of the dystopian world they're supposed to inhabit.","

On the other hand, the movies based on the trilogy are so powerful and energetic that they have turned Katniss into a symbol.And now, a few words about this movie:
My expectations were, rightly so, enormous-at least 7, maybe even 8 stars. After just half an hour, it became clear to me that this film is simply a waste of time-nothing substantial!

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","grigoraaakis-889-295918","22 November 2023","I really am glad I watched this one in the theaters. ""The Hunger Games"" is one of the most important dystopian series ever created because it's targeted towards young adults. This franchise is shaping young minds, it's an absolute wonder. Although I miss the frenzy that came with the movie during that era, I am so happy I get to experience a different story in the same universe. In ""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" Snow is the protagonist. A younger maybe more human version of Snow. This is the story about Lucy Gray, but don't get it confused, when the time comes this story can have only one main protagonist and that is Snow. I love everything Francis Lawrence brought to this movie, he knows how to craft them, set the setting and he knows how to navigate us through Panem. I really don't mind how this is a long movie because it's divided in three parts where every single one of them tells a different story about Snow. Every single one of them is essential in realising how he grew into the bloodthirsty,ruthless man that became the President of Panem. Rachel Zegler's Lucy Gray is nothing like Katniss but she has all fascinated with her charm. Viola Davis is so good an actor that she stole every single one of the scenes she is in. She's so fascinatingly evil. I feel like this movie brings a new perspective to the dystopian world of Panem, it brings a new insight in everything that lead to the events of the trilogy and a much needed insight I feel, to the philosophy of the Games as an event. I really am looking forward to reading the book, Suzanne Collins has done it again and I'm falling into the ""Hunger Games"" spiral once more.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","virindra","18 December 2023","I have seen the movies with Katniss and I liked them. This one not so much. I did not like the female main actress. Her acting was not loveable and I just did not believe it. Why did she have to sing?The writers have been up and down in every corner to make links between this movie and the movies before, but the links could easily be forgotten as well.There were so many flaws and ideas that made no sense at all, like the birds who could copy human voices with a device. What was up at the end of the movie? Since this is a prequel, what kind of effect did it have for the other movies? Was Katniss Snow's child?The only plus was the male actor. But he could not carry the whole movie on his shoulders. This movie is just a waste of my time. It was better if I wasted on Napoleon, but can't go back can I?","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","waltermwilliams","16 November 2023","In the near future ""Big Brother"" has evolved into ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is the first prequel, set 64 years prior to ""The Hunger Games"" in a city being rebuilt after a civil war destroyed the Capitol of Panem and obliterated District13.It too is based on a novel written by Suzanne Collins, who also wrote for the Hunger Games trilogy.The director in charge of ""The Hunger Games"" franchise since 2013 is back, and Francis Lawrence has pulled heavily from the novel.As President Snow (Donald Sutherland) reminded us in the series many times before and again in this telling, ""It's the things we love most that destroy us"" and this will make even more sense in the movie.The legend that changed the game Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth as a bleached blonde) is a mentor and we watch his change from a person of integrity who steps across that line into evil.At one point in the movie his curly locks are shaved GI Joe style and he's a dead ringer for Eminem.It's only fitting because in this period of his life he loses himself (pardon the pun)...at least his old decent self.Snow has plenty of evil role models including ""Dr Casca Highbottom"".An ironic name considering he's played by Peter Dinklage...one of the finest actors of my generation.And the other antagonist Viola Davis as snake breeding ""Dr Volumnia Gaul"" is pure evil...both inspired casting.""Tigris Snow"" (Hunter Schafer) is Mr Snows only surviving cousin from the Dark Days and there are hints at her fashion designer flair in this movie, of course in the last part of the trilogy Snow tires of his relative and forces her to be tattooed like a Tiger, but she gets her revenge.Every tribute has a story and the main Tribute is Rachel Zegler as ""Lucy Gray Baird"".In fact, she is the same age that Jennifer Lawrence was when she portrayed ""Katniss Everdeen"" when the first Hunger Games movie was released.There are a few nods to the Games original heroine ""Katniss"" in this prequel including her curtsy and a wild flower bearing her name.Lucy loves a singalong...hence ""The Ballad of Songbirds"" subtitle and at times I though I was watching an episode of ""Glee"" (just shoot me now).Every saga has a beginning
In this Games there's so many clues this is decades before the original Games movies were set with older technology in TV Monitors, cameras, architecture and even Peace Keepers uniforms (they don't look like Storm Troopers yet).It's got a 50's America vibe, which will tap in nicely to the current retro trend of everything old is new again in 2023.Jason Schwartzman plays the first ever host of The Hunger Games as ""Lucky Flickerman"" (Weatherman & Magician) is a scene stealer with some of the best lines.He is of course part of a media family dynasty that includes Caesar Flickerman (Stan Tucci) in the original four part trilogy.While not as polished as his Grandson he reminds everyone to ""smile..that's why you have teeth"" something Caesar took to heart with his cheesy Hollywood smile.Yet again the drones play a part in distributing water and other much needed supplies to the tributes, but it's new technology and they need to iron out a few bugs in these deadly drones.Every movie lately is divided into chapters with titles superimposed on the big screen.I blame the rise of Audiobooks, but I shouldn't complain because I've narrated a few.Listen out for: ""Can't Catch Me Now"" by Olivia Rodrigo in the closing credits.If you want to know how quickly civilisation disappears you've come to the right movie.Everything is about winning in The Hunger Games saga and this origins movie is no different.Enjoy the show...all 2 hrs 37 Minutes of epic Hunger Games action, adventure and drama.This will be one of the smash hits of Summer 2023!You are invited to return to the Games which have been a welcome addition to our movie universe for over a decade.You just know Snow will land on top, but it's also good to see Snow fall.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","gabe-82146","25 December 2023","I loved the dark totalitarian atmosphere of the original trilogy with fantastic acting, impressive set/costume design, and next-level writing. This movie completely subverts these expectations. Surely it has a different director? Nope-it's the same guy who directed the trilogy. Is it based on a novel by a different author? Nope. Same source material. So how the hell did it go so wrong that it feels like a low-budget Hunger Games live action fan fic courtesy of Kidz Bop and YouTube TV?The moment this movie begins, it feels like an edgy anime show. Exposition hits like a truck, and it's clear the writers don't even remotely trust you to glean that the main cast are elitists without making them the laziest, most one-dimensional portrayals of ""elite rich kids"" I've seen in years with over-the-top cartoonish snobbiness. ""Hello class partner! We do every project together!"" ""Hello rich dad kid. Surprised your dad bought you out of trouble AGAIN >:("". It's like they constantly tread the line of ""show don't tell"" so recklessly that even when they're showing, it feels like you're being spoon fed every piece of information they want you to know.The entire premise just doesn't make sense. Why are they trusting 18-year-old kids (played by 28-year-old actors) to mentor contestants in the Hunger Games? Why do they so haphazardly throw together the games? I get that the technology is worse, but they couldn't even clean up the arena the day before the games after it had just been bombed? They couldn't hire more than two Peacekeepers to man the gates? Why does Lucy stop to leave snake traps instead of just escaping? Why do the Peacekeepers gun down multiple contestants who are posing no threat before the games even begin? Why does the main antagonist (Viola Davis) send Snow into the arena to retrieve his friend instead of Peacekeepers who are already at the gates? Whenever they send in donations, the drones accelerate at a dangerous speeds directly into the contestants' faces, and after this happens TWICE even leading to the death of one of the contestants, they still allow this to keep happening to the point that the main character later calls a drone strike that takes out five contestants during a fight, which is deemed totally acceptable.When the love interest girl from District 12 is introduced, she begins singing a song while making overexaggerated facial expressions into the camera, wearing a colorful white dress with a substantial amount of lipstick and makeup. She inexplicably assaults a girl with a snake, which is never mentioned again in the film. And it's later revealed D12 throws frequent musical concerts with high-end guitars, cellos, speakers, and microphones in an underground concert hall, and that they'll sometimes retreat to a lake house wearing comfortable modern swimwear to have fun on vacations. So the people living in the most starved and oppressed district who were fighting tooth and nail for food in the previous movies, living in small, beaten-down wooden buildings, are now living comfortable lifestyles throwing underground Kidz Bop concerts? There's such substantial tonal whiplash that it doesn't even remotely feel like the same universe. How are we supposed to understand these people to be oppressed when every time they're on the screen, they're breaking out into dance and song and going to the lake house for vacations?The music just feels generic-that is, when the movie isn't in musical revolutionary tune mode, at which point you wish Lucy wouldn't overexaggerate every syllable like those Star Spangled Banner performers. The main actor is mediocre and looks/acts like Macklemore with hair that is clearly not naturally blonde. His love interest, coming from extreme poverty, looks, dresses, and acts like a disney princess. The sets are somewhat interesting having a more old-fashioned tone, but it just feels low budget overall, which is surprising considering how this movie had a higher budget than the original Hunger Games. The entire Hunger Games arena was literally just a hastily crafted metal circle. I get these are the days before it was well-developed, but at least give us something. The games didn't feel even remotely dynamic, and the announcer kept saying things at times like ""Oops, we don't have a camera there! We'll add one next year"". Like did they spend any time planning this? While one of the contestants is dying, the announcer is literally reading the weather on the TV. The ending is undercooked and kind of makes sense, but not completely. Everyone kept calling Lucy Gray by her full name. Lucy Gray, Lucy Gray, Lucy Gray-it never ends. And they also kept calling her ""songbird"" (because she sings), which of course sounded completely normal to hear over and over across several characters. The love interest had no character arc and was borderline insufferable, and Snow's character arc didn't really feel natural. It felt like his arc evolved wherever the plot needed to go without making logical sense. And of course the main characters are both orphans because every YA novel aggressively fetishizes having a rough upbringing that have no impact on the story.Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage gave the best performances they could have given the writing. Peter Dinklage hated the main character because he is poor and for no other reason (and again, the author takes any excuse for more oppression fetishization... like it's okay if your character is oppressed, but at least explore it rather than just use it as a cheap, unsuccessful ploy to gain audience sympathy). And Viola Davis was a mad scientist for some reason, whom I think gave the strongest performance in the film, which was impressive considering how they dressed her like a clown. But overall, this movie was so, so much worse than the originals. It didn't really do anything well, including worldbuilding, which I was really anticipating. As a standalone movie, it's entertaining enough to be a 5/10, or maybe a bit higher. But as a sequel to such a fantastic trilogy, it was a colossal disappointment, and I'm extremely disheartened they missed such a great opportunity to build in mature ways on the world of Panam.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","gatorgirlnv","16 November 2023","At a little after two hours (out of 2 hours and 37 minutes of run time), I couldn't stand it anymore and with no end in sight, I left the theater before I fell into a coma. The 10th Hunger Games was the shortest, least interesting and unchallenging of all. I don't think the actual ""game"" even lasted 20 minutes. Gone was all the CGI, the different effects and terrains and all the out-of-nowhere things to challenge the players in addition to the tributes trying to kill each other. I found Rachel Zegler's character, Lucy Gray, annoying at every turn, shallow, not particularly clever, with no real depth or even a back story. I wish they'd just have focused almost entirely on the character of Coriolanus Snow, the mentor, who was very interesting and checked off all the personality points that Lucy Gray didn't. I tried to wait to see how his story played out, but even that wasn't worth waiting for. But, ladies and gentlemen, the first Hunger Games Musical! Zegler can barely get through a scene without bursting into song and her W. Virginia twang in both song and speech is over-the-top fake and gets closer and closer to nails on a chalkboard as the movie goes on. If they left out all the singing, the movie could have probably been a half hour shorter. I love Peter Dinklage, but he looked about as bored as I did. In short, if you're going in there looking for signs or similarities to all the other ""Hunger Games"", skip this because you won't find it. Save yourself the money and time.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","catherinehamel","18 December 2023","It's been a while since I didn't saw a movie I couldn't finish. I was so excited to watch it since I'm a huge fan of hunger game but it was disappointing. The characters are blend, you don't get attached to them, the pace of the movie is weird it's rushed but at the same time nothing happens. The relationship between Snow and Lucy gray was rushed too and so cringe, like girl you don't fall in love after the 2nd time seeing the person that get pay if you don't die.You know the feeling when you wait for the movie to really start but it never really start? I was able to watch half of the movie out of curiosity but couldn't reach the end, it was too hard to watch.I think I'll just read the book at this point after reading some reviews that say that the movie didn't do justice to the book.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","trinaboice","27 November 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
We get an origin story, of sorts, of President Coriolanus Snow. What the filmmakers are able to show us in only one movie reminded me of Anakin's plunge into the Dark Side that took place in 3 of the Star Wars films.This movie is directed by Francis Lawrence who also directed 3 of the other Hunger Games movies. It's designed as a prequel to the 2012 Hunger Games film. It's supposed to take place 64 years prior.The dramatic film was written by Michael Lesslie, Michael Arndt, and Suzanne Collins. Because they were able to secure an interim agreement from SAG-AFTRA, they were able to market the movie during the 2023 actors' strike.THINGS I LIKED:
Rachel Zegler is so beautiful and has such a lovely voice! She sang all of her songs live on set! I'm excited to see her in Snow White in 2025! She and fellow co-star, Josh Andres Rivera, met while filming the 2021 movie West Side Story together. They're actually dating in real life!Tom Blyth does a great job as Coriolanus Snow. It's fascinating to watch the story unfold when we already know how he ends up in later films. Dexter Sol Answell is completely adorable as the young Coriolanus.Academy Award winner Viola Davis won the role of the villain in this prequel after director Francis Lawrence saw a sinister meme of her that a fan had posted online! She's excellent, of course.I really liked seeing Jason Schwartzman slowly develop the skills he would need later as the flashy Lucretius ""Lucky"" Flickerman.All of the characters are well defined and it's easy to quickly feel something for them. The cast includes Peter Dinklage, Burn Gorman, Fionnula Flanagan, Pliny Harrington, Festus Creed, and many more.The set designs are outstanding.Cool special effects.The movie definitely isn't a musical, yet music plays a big role in the film and perfectly fits the title of the film. I didn't expect to hear so much music in this! I know, that's silly since the word ""ballad"" is in the title! I really enjoyed the musical element in the storyline. It gave a real down-to-earth feeling, and the lyrics showed us how much changed and how much remained the same in the districts.I love that costume designer Trish Summerville included Katniss and Primrose flowers on it as a respectful nod to the previous Hunger Games movies. Nice touch!There are several references to the previous films such as when Lucy Gray curtsies at the ceremony like Katniss did in the 2012 movie.I haven't read the book, but I hear it's a very good adaptation!It's fun to see how the Hunger Games were more amateur in the beginning compared to the glossy veneer they acquired over the decades.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Many of the scenes are visually dark, so it'll be hard to see everything that's going on if you watch this on a small streaming device once the film goes to Video on Demand.It seemed ridiculous that Lucy Gray Baird had a beautiful, colorful, and expensive-looking dress while living in a poor district. It was pretty though!Some of the actors deliver lines mechanically.It drove me nuts when Lucy Gray Baird would just sit instead of run away. She seemed super cocky considering she wasn't a very good fighter.All of the characters looked normal, but Viola Davis was so over the top and seemed out of place.While the movie is a prequel to the original trilogy, it's not an origin story of the actual Hunger Games.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Violence with various weapons and hand-to-hand combat
Explosions and destruction
Some blood and gore
We see people die.If you don't like snakes, you're going to be very uncomfortable watching some of the scenes.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","cowboywayfest","20 November 2023","After the trilogy we were really looking forward to this prequel. If you're wanting the excitement of the trilogy this is a fail. If you're looking for the love story, this is a fail. And if you're looking for a political statement amongst the story this is extremely weak though not a total fail. Don't expect any pomp and circumstances or fantastic outfits either.The characters are shallow, the story line even more so. The angst doesn't come through.It's clear from the get go what motivates Snow--self preservation. Period. But we already knew that from the trilogy. Duh. He didn't wrestle with any moral or ethical questions whatsoever although the weak attempts alluding to such. He has always been an a$$hat.And the son of Plinth?! Srsly unbelievable considering his background and upbringing. And to think that Daddy didn't even attempt to bail him out a last time?! Nawh dawwg. Not buying it.Almost no development of any of the tribute ""players"". You don't really have anyone but Ms. Gray to root for. And what IS the deal of always using her full name? It's stupid.Acting is very good, as it should be. Effects are few but well done. The weatherman/emcee is the only real connection to what we saw in the trilogy and yet still incomplete.Overall disappointed, would rather have seen it at home.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Aegelis","28 November 2023","An epic character story, Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes gets closer to the origin of how this post-apocalyptic future happens through the eyes of president-to-be Snow. Dramatic elements are heavy, intrigue abounds, politics play their part, and the action sequence provides a hefty dose of tension.Actors/Actresses were the highlight of the film for me, with captivating believability, emotion, and expression. Directing was a close second. CGI was obvious but not as off-putting as earlier 2000s films. A few questionable events at the end were head-scratchers and overall think the film would've been better finished at the climax rather than the downward slope. Still, a very enjoyable movie.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","sherylchilders82","23 November 2023","I've read the Hunger Games trilogy several times, including the audiobooks in anticipation of this film. I purposefully did not read the book for this movie, because I like to read the books after. While the rating seems good, I'm not understanding the large number of negative reviews.The Hunger Games is YA - it seems a lot of people are expecting something different. The school setting of the trainers and Viola Davis's character felt very appropriate for the genre, and so did the immature characters. The melodrama between them, and the general focus was exactly as expected. The movie has a PG-13 rating, so while it is a dark story, the violence is toned down. This is not Game of Thrones, despite Peter Dinklage being there. I suspect the lack of intensity might have been an issue in expectations for some. In addition, the games themselves are only one part, rather than the main focus of the film. This is not a sequel meant to relive the original trilogy. Those books and movies stand alone. That saga is complete.However, if you focus on the message and themes, much of the story is actually very striking. Snow is a realistic villain, which is exactly the point. It also occurs in the time of his life when these character developments really occur. He is never a completely sympathetic character because that would not be believable. From the beginning, we can see that he is strategizing more than caring, in contrast to many of his classmates, especially his friend, Plinth. In fact, he is a star mentor right away, attracting the attention of the head game maker, played by Viola Davis. The story is well crafted, and I'm so excited to now fill in the blanks by reading the book. There are indeed hints at unanswered questions.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","jazzsp8-94-555706","27 December 2023","I'm at best a casual Hunger Games fan. I've watched them because my wife wanted to, not normally my thing at all. I eye rolled when told they'd made a prequel.BUT - I'll hold my hands up, I enjoyed it more than I thought.Seeing how Snow becomes the man we know from the later films was quite enjoyable, I get what others are saying about the ending seeming quite rushed when we start to see his true colours though. I think I'd have enjoyed a more nuanced approach to this. But it really didn't ruin anything the way it was done.I see a lot of complaints complaining that it wasn't a faithful adaption of the book. I've never read the book so I can't speak to that but I can count on one hand the amount of books I've read that have been faithfully translated to screen - It almost never happens the way that satisfies everyone, people should be used to that by now.As for the songs been complained about, well perhaps they should try listening to them - I thought they helped convey a lot of narrative and emotion and the film would be missing something more without them. And for those comparing this to a musical because of them, then they should probably go and watch a musical to find out how wrong they are there as well. Ridiculous statements.Was / is it the best film ever? No. Of course not.Does it deserve the panning some people give it based on it not being an accurate representation of the book? Nope.Does it deserve to be slagged off for being a musical? Nope.Does it deserve a watch if you've any interest in the Hunger Games world? Absolutely.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","DanLawson146","17 November 2023","POSITIVES:1) I thought all of the central performances were excellent. They made all of the main characters feel very engaging and I was locked in for the whole film
2) I loved the darkness of the film and of this series in general. It feels right on the border between a film for teens and a film for adults and I think that's a really good place to be. The inner turmoil and conflict that the two leads feel throughout the film is very powerful, as well as the outer turmoil and conflict that is happening throughout the events of the film
3) The production of the film was really high class. The cinematography, score etc clearly had a lot of budget and effort put into themNEGATIVES:1) I did find the film a bit too cringey at times. The singing was too much for me for starters - if it was once or twice it would've been powerful but it happens so often that it becomes sickly. Also Snow's classmates were all just cliché bullies which felt cringey and predictable
2) The end felt very rushed to me, despite the film being over two and a half hours it still felt like it needed more time to wrap things up properly. Snow and Lucy Gray becoming enemies felt out of nowhere and the film leaves more questions than it answers. What happened to Lucy Gray? What are the after effects of Highbottom dying? What happens with the seeming conflict between Snow and Tigriss?3) There were too many references to the original series that felt far too on the nose. I actually thought hearing The Hanging Tree and hearing President Snow's voice at the end were both good call backs, but the references to Katniss and to the Mockingjays were far too on the nose for me.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","lindhardt09","17 February 2024","The acting was mostly alright, but sometimes felt a little forced. To me the worst part was that the most important scene near the end was changed taking away all the power from the main female character. She ended up feeling empty and utterly useless. She couldn't have even been used as eye candy by that point since her camera angles always seemed to catch her in the most unappealing light they possibly could. The other power scenes for the female characters were all ruined for me since it seemed like they over played them times to try to stick it to the man moments. While they were those types of moments, as soon as an actor tries too hard to make it appear that, it has lost all it's power for me.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ta-98251","18 November 2023","The Hunger Games movies, for the most part, have been well made and faithful adaptations of the books. So when I turned the final page of Hunger Games: The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes, I was looking forward to the movie much more than I expected to before I started reading the book.Thankfully The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes is another strong and faithful adaptation. We return to the capital 65 years before the events of original Hunger Games films and a few years after the Panem Civil War. We meet a young Cornelius Snow shortly before he and his Capitol class mates mentor tributes in the 10th Annual Hunger Games. We then embark on a three part character study.Firstly, the Capitol looked great. It's not the over the top, bright, excessive and indulgent Capitol we are used to. It's dark and gritty but also a futuristic city seeking to make technological advances. There are times when the CGI is shaky for example when we see cockroaches, rats or explosions but otherwise the film looks great. I especially enjoyed some of the camera work and the interesting use of angles that brought us closer to the action.Viola Davis and Pinter Dinklage were excellent in their roles as Dr Gaul and Dean Highbottom whilst Jason Schwartzman was fantastic as Lucky Flickerman, the movie's only comic relief as weatherman and host of the Hunger Games. The two leads will likely draw several different opinions. They weren't perfect but still had aspects that worked. Tom Blyth played a good Cornelius Snow although it is hard not to think about how majestic Donald Sutherlund is as a older more Powerful Snow. Rachel Zeglar has a great voice which is fully on display as Songbird Lucy Grey Baird, the female tribute from District 12. I wasn't fully sold on other aspects of her performance. That being said, If I had to recast one character in the Hunger Games franchise it would still be Peeta. The chemistry between the leads was questionable at times but perhaps that is to be expected when a boy from the Capitol meets a girl from District 12?I enjoyed the story when I read the book and it was represented well on screen. The movie builds on the lore of The Hunger Games and especially the background of Cornelius Snow in a way that helps us to interpret the originally trilogy in a much more profound way. Director Francis Lawrence originally wanted to split the movie in two but I'm glad it ended up being one movie. However, this resulted in a runtime of 2 hours 37 minutes. The movie squeezed a lot into this time which mostly worked well although there were a couple of instances where I questioned things which happened on screen which I didn't question when reading the book because I had more information available to me at the time. So those who haven't read the book may find it stuffed and the weight of certain scenes may not have the intended impact.The action is fun and brutal at times. At no point did I feel as if they we were catering to a younger audience. This Hunger Games was set in standard oval stadium in the times before the elaborate settings of the future games. This resulted in a larger focus on close combat and hiding which I enjoyed.Overall, The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes is another well adapted Hunger Games movie. Its dark, gritty and more importantly it tells a standalone story but also a story that enhances our understanding of Cornelius Snow and allows us to view the original trilogy in a way that adds additional layers to the viewing experience. It's a long film and has a lot going on which may not cater to everybody. Highly recommended to fans of the Hunger Games.","

At that time the Hunger Games viewership was beginning to wane and Dr. Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis), the gamemaster, wanted to do something to increase viewership. To do that, the upper class Capital students would have to be mentors to the newest batch of selectees for the tenth annual Hunger Games. Snow got Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler) from District 12.Snow had more of an incentive than any other student to succeed with his underling. He and his family were totally broke and the Plinth Prize money was the only thing that could save them from homelessness and humiliation. He poured everything into helping the soulful Lucy Gray, but was it out of love, selfishness, or both?Even though ""Songbirds & Snakes"" was two hours and forty-five minutes long, it was enjoyable. I think I looked at my watch once towards the end. They somehow were able to make the actual Hunger Games (meaning the fight to survive) interesting though it was cruder and more rudimentary. Maybe my memory has failed me, but the prequel seemed more vicious, violent, and cutthroat. And that wasn't a bad thing. The performances were great and I think it even evoked more of an emotional response from the viewer. Snow was a mercurial character--sympathetic at times, cunning, smart, and maybe a little sinister. He was worth watching.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","abbyprow","18 November 2023","I'm a big fan of The Hunger Games franchise and I think this movie absolutely does the book justice. This movie is almost exactly how I pictured things in my head while reading the book which is incredibly rare in book to movie adaptations. It adds so much to the world of The Hunger Games and is a must watch even if you're a casual fan.The songs are an integral part of the story and are such a big part of Lucy Gray's character. Rachel Zegler is a good singer and did a phenomenal job bringing Lucy Gray to life. Tom Blyth was an excellent choice for Snow. You're able to see every emotion cross his face as he endures so much throughout the story. I'm very happy with the film overall and I highly recommend taking the time to watch it.","

Mind you, I love post-apocalyptic dystopian fare like any other regular chap, so I thought I'd give this film a go. But well, this is the kind of post-apo yarn where folks are always impeccably dressed with perfect hairdos and teeth, because hey, you may live in a soul-crushing totalitarian society and still care about your physique, right? This made me think of ""Logan's Run"" (yes, I'm old), which is a compliment I guess... kind of.I particularly enjoyed each time we see Mr. Hottie show off his impeccable torso and abs (5 times in about 2 hours and 30mn, it must have been in his contract). At that point I also decided to mindlessly enjoy the ineffable Peter Dinklage (not his torso and abs though). I felt some schadenfreude at seeing him go through the motions of a Song of Ice and F..., er, a Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, heartily quaffing wine while philosophizing about the Snow family. Good old times... Speaking of which, what kind of name is Coriolanus Snow?? Ah well, rather than try to make sense of the Shakespearean ref I heartily enjoyed all the wordplays and witty metaphors based on snow (""Snow always lands on top""). Finally the subtle Christian imagery (he gets bitten by a snake, get it???) revealed this flick to be a deep meditation on good and evil in this fallen world of ours, human nature, and white teeth. Especially white teeth.","

I expected the hunger games and some singing like the iconic song but this was something else and not in a good way.It seemed more like a movie about a country singer, which is fine but don't call it the hunger games. The characters were weakly developed and the story was miserable. It was hard to empathize with anyone in the movie and honestly quite boring.They could've taken the time to develop the characters but instead wasted all the time on lengthy singing. I get that singing is essential but there's simply too much of it for a movie like the hunger games.Not a movie to watch in the cinema. Just wait for it to stream.","

The other 4 movies had more essence, a better storyline, more attention to detail and a better understanding of the outlines of the games. The Spanish actress who played the girl who sang country music was not good. Her singing was the only thing that appealed. Viola Davis was just ok as the previous Elizabeth Banks. Not good enough. The Snow guy looked like Ryan Gosling, but overall this movies was not in any comparison of the previous. I hope they don't make a sequel, it's just doing harm.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","yespat","22 November 2023","Because of the good reviews, I thought I'd take a chance on this. It was surprisingly entertaining except it seemed they couldn't find a way to turn the young Snow into a villain without an idiot plot point.Everything made sense until he was sent into the ring to save his friend. He asked his superior to send in the ""peacekeepers"" but was told that the cameras were on and the public didn't want to see them in there. Then the young Snow was told that the cameras would be off when he went in to retrieve his friend so there would be no record of his entering the ring. After he went in, he killed one of the contestants out of seeming rage though, at that moment, he had more relief at safely retrieving his friend than anger so powerful that he could kill someone.Those 2 idiot plot points allowed him to lie to his girlfriend and ultimately lead her to not trust him and leave him. Had he never killed that contestant, he would have not had an opportunity to lie to his girlfriend and they would have escaped to the north, free. There would never have been a grown up mean Snow, thus no future Hunger Games movies featuring Snow.The other troublesome part was how, when the young lovers stumbled upon a cabin, how was it that the guns made it in there before they got there? And how did she know the guns were in there?So, there were a few things that, i think had they cleaned them up, would have made for a really great movie. As it was, what they ended up with was a movie that was a better than expected sequel (that is a prequel.). So i gave it a rating of 6.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","pedroquintaoo","16 November 2023","This prequel presents a remarkable first part that successfully revives the compelling elements of ""The Hunger Games"" saga, evoking excitement through the portrayal of tributes, the inhumane Capitol management, and poignant metaphors. The smaller arena contributes to an intense atmosphere, maintaining a delicate balance between avoiding explicit deaths and ensuring a family-friendly rating. The contextualization of the early games adds an intriguing layer, highlighting the evolution from the initial to the final games in the original saga.The protagonists, notably Lucy and the nuanced portrayal of the young President Snow, add depth and memorability to the narrative. Despite limited development, secondary characters establish a connection with the audience, eliciting a range of emotions. The film introduces a darker atmosphere not present in the original saga, with memorable scenes like the eerie mockingjays repeating the last words before public executions.However, the second part, while interesting for narrative development, feels rushed, leaving room for a more thorough exploration of characters and consequences. This critique suggests that splitting the narrative into two films could have enhanced the depth of the second part, allowing for additional scenes to intensify the storyline. The justifications for President Snow's personality change, although present, are portrayed quickly and lack convincing depth. Despite these shortcomings, the film stands out for its impactful first part, rivaling or even surpassing key scenes from the original two films.","

Normally, it's a perfect series with both a strong plot and an original old film, but this new film is both empty and long. Moreover, the atmosphere is so different that it seems a lot has changed in 65 years (compared to the original film). There's no similarity in the setting, and I find the setting quite dull; it's a major mistake.Characters: The actors weren't bad at their jobs, but they weren't good either. Definitely, the acting in the first film was much better. I can say that the actors were a bit inexperienced, and especially, they couldn't convey fear. There were no scared expressions on their faces; it was as if they were playing a little charming game.And finally, thanks to them for ruining the perfection and indispensability of the film.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","sweetest-kait","8 December 2023","Hey, I'm a faithful Hunger Games fan (original series), but I was so moved by my distaste for this story that I needed to leave a review.First, not only was I uninterested in reading the book version of this story, but I was pretty horrified to see/try to understand what the point of it was. The story starts with Snow's family being broke because people stopped watching the hunger games (good), and am I supposed to enjoy watching him slowly devolve? His sister literally gives him the permission not to be a bad person, and he chooses to be one for no apparent reason? Just cuz? None of the classically justifiable villain origin story tropes happen to this kid to make me care that he's evil. He's just bad, and continues to choose to be bad for power's sake (boring). In my opinion, he was bad at the beginning and as soon as he enjoyed/definitely didn't hate doing murder, it just got worse.Second, this is the kind of romantic relationship that one would have in college. He's hot, he'll ruin your life, he'll make you think you're being protected until you break free and someday start writing slam poetry to process your trauma. So, good for her for cutting and running (although not soon enough imo). Her instincts were good at least.Lastly, GOD it was so uncomfortable to watch near the end. When he's just running through the woods with a machine gun because his feelings were hurt I couldn't help but think, ""oh god, this is my worst nightmare and also I hope nobody who sees this will think of him as their hero."" They will. Someone always will. Why do people waste their time telling stories about these characters? Even worse, with no character development. I don't mind watching someone be evil on screen, but give me a ray of hope.Baseline, I don't care about President Snows origin story. I don't care that he was young once. I don't care that he had a family. I don't even care that he was maybe in something like love. Tell me a story about someone who is challenged and GROWS and changes. That's the kind of story we need right now. Not this.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","HalBanksy","21 November 2023","I read this book when it first released - found it quite muddled and underwhelming, then quickly forgot it. I feel the same about the film. Entertaining enough and watchable, but nothing blew me away. There's just a spark that is missing. Also the characters repeat each others (unbearably annoying) names every 10 seconds - this got very old very fast..The first two Hunger Games films were really elevated by inspired casting choices. Nobody here is close to that level except Viola Davis who steals each of her scenes. She adds much needed charisma and camp energy to this rather flat group of actors. It's actually the kind of performance that could have saved the mediocre Mockingjay films, instead of whatever Julianne Moore was doing.The lead couple's lack of chemistry here actually makes their scenes quite confusing. It was difficult to understand what motivated their actions, especially towards the end. Peter Dinklage is very poor, blatantly bored with this script and just cashing a cheque.Overall it was fun, but I think this could have worked much better as a television series. Dividing each of the three parts of the film into a few hour long episodes would have given some room for the narrative to breathe and build empathy for these characters.","

Does this explore how the games began? Or is it about something else? .. Well, it's unclear till the end and after.Hated how they made this into a musical and how the film didn't delve as deeply into Coryo's close bond with his mom as the book did. In the book, Ma Plinth is portrayed as a sweet and nurturing mother figure who practically adopts him into the family, providing him with food and support. Her role makes Coryo's betrayal of Sejanus and his eventual demise even more heartbreaking.Yes, there is something that I liked; decent/promising casting.","

Before watching the movie, I told my friends we shouldn't watch it as the trailer already looked lame, then we watched the movie and I was right! It felt like a romance movie with the hunger games in the background. No scenes made me emotional, I wanted to go home the first hour but stayed so I could laugh at the stupidity of it. When Katniss sang Hanging Tree in Mockingjay, I wanted to cry. The rawness of her voice and not trying to sound amazing but wanting to portray an emotion of death and sadness was incredible, you can literally hear it. This time around, it was sang as if she was auditioning for Americans Got Talent. I understand it's ""The Ballad of the Songbirds"" but it's at that point just make it a musical. This shouldnt be part of the OG hunger games series as the games only lasted like an hour out of 2.5 hours of the movie lol. Plus, watching it felt like they were in costumes, idk just me? Like I didnt notice it as much during the other movies because everything just made sense.

Buckle up, folks - we're in for a lukewarm journey.Coriolanus Snow's transformation is like watching a caterpillar attempt ballet - ambitious but fundamentally awkward. Tom Blyth and Viola Davis give stellar performances, though it feels a bit like winning an Oscar for a school play. And that brief love story? It's the spice equivalent of saltine crackers - a bit bland.Now, the characters. Picture a group of friends you wouldn't invite to your birthday party. That's them. More background and growth? Apparently, that's too much to ask. The pacing is so off; I thought I accidentally switched to 'Hunger Games: The Slow Motion Edition.' Trim it? More like perform a cinematic exorcism.Rachel Zegler's acting is stiffer than a frozen baguette, and the singing scenes? It's like they handed out microphones at a karaoke night for tone-deaf cats. The connection to the original Hunger Games series is shakier than my Wi-Fi during a storm.'The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes' has its moments, like finding a semi-interesting receipt in your wallet - mildly intriguing, but hardly a jackpot.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","bussinworker","1 January 2024","You can find a review on this everywhere else I will skip to what I felt could have been so interesting and was missed out on.This story has always had deep themes around class warfare, dystopian government, mankind's ability to separate people and make Others Inhuman and able to be treated as cattle. So I think one big missed opportunity is with the plot around the Mentor Program and Corio Snow. Something that has always stuck with me are the servant master relationships we hear about during the American Slavery period. Famously, Thomas Jefferson had a very romantic time with one of his slaves. There should have been more about Lucy Gray, what does she really feel, does she feel grateful? Do they really fall in love or is she playing him? Yes there is that in the beginning but the movie never has the guts to say, these people are in a deep love for each other even though its a sick relationship with an extreme power imbalance. Perhaps they could show her having the power over a foolish Snow. She gets him to rig the games for her and yet has a soft spot for him by the end. Snow could be scandalized by being shown addicted to his ""lesser human"" girlfriend and therefore his cheating allegations and exile would impact him because he would be deeply grieving feeling that he would never see Lucy again. Lots of ways they could go with this.Also there is just not enough done with the 1960s TV premise. What if this was the first Games in Color? People in The Capital would see the red blood of kids for the first time, would that make a difference on how Panem sees the kids? So many characters could bring you a deep feeling through their eyes of seeing all this awful trauma.How Snow relates to the people on District 12 how it made him change The Hunger Games in how he did how it made him see the people of Panem as human beings and yet how he rationalized seeing himself as worthy of dominating and controlling them at the end, is stuff that can take the viewers on a ride of terror and imagination.The premise, theme, storyline and dialogues of this movie in the right hands are Oscar winning. Too bad they failed on most execution. Another movie that could be life changing wasted in the Hollywood machine. At least it was watchable and had some cool world building so 5/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","southdavid","8 January 2024","Having seen, but never been a particularly big fan of ""The Hunger Games"" movies, I almost didn't go and see his prequel. But it worked out timewise, and I really want to make a concerted effort to see more films at the cinema this year, so I decided to risk it. I was surprisingly impressed with how complex the descent of Snow was handled.With his family near destitute, Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) is banking on graduating from the academy with the prestigious Plinth Prize, which would solve his families' problems. However, at the last moment he, and the rest of this class, are tasked with a final assignment. They each have to mentor a competitor in this years Hunger Games, the 10th annual event, the future of which is in doubt as people have stopped watching. Snow is placed with Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler) a musical performer from district 12, who is charismatic and personable, but lacking the heart for the violence to come.So, I remembered enough to know that Snow would go on to be the President and antagonist of the later films, so I knew roughly where we were heading. I was surprised at how slowly paced and ... justifiable even ... the stages of his compromised heel turn were. I understand he's more of a monster from the beginning in the book and some people criticised this adaptation for that, but this has to be a more interesting way to go, and Tom Blyth does a good job of keeping things balanced. I liked a lot of the performances, with Viola Davis going big as the current games organiser and Peter Dinklage in a role that becomes more sympathetic as the films goes on.I don't think I'd argue against the film's other criticism though, that's it's long. I did feel its two and half hour run time. With the Hunger Games themselves competed around the halfway point in the film. I'd also say we could have done with a little more differentiation between the other competitors as I often wasn't sure who was who.I don't want to go overboard and over praise a film which does have some issues, but given I had almost no expectation going on, that it was a surprisingly complex and accomplished film, was a nice surprise.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","big-sky14","20 January 2024","The major beats of the book plot play out more or less exactly as written here in the movie. It falls flat because the author decided this story required ""adult pathos"" to justify its existence, and, most unfortunately, writes that pathos like a 12 year old making their first big foray into Wattpad. Other than a few vaguely satisfying beats in the (very short) Games sequence, there's nothing here but incredibly amateurish melodrama, and that's all true-to-text.All the best parts of the political intrigue and action/adventure that make the first trilogy so engaging are completely absent, or present only as cameo-style, utterly embarrassing call-backs to those 10-year-old stories that actually interested you. The romance was the worst part of the original series, but here you're begging for it because if it's not the current on-screen focus then you're probably watching a bizarre musical theater kid wet dream where Everybody Has To Stop And Be Impressed By Your Heartfelt Singing That Happens To Be Precisely Suited To The Collective Emotional Moment And Isn't That So Cool. There are literally five or six EXTENDED musical sequences that serve absolutely no plot function, but are wielded by the author like plot points nonetheless, because she's got nothing else to offer while moving the story forward.This flick may not actually be 525,600 minutes long but you could sure fool me by the end.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","lahiru-61317","25 December 2023","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" falls short of the high expectations set by its predecessors. Despite its attempt to delve into the origin story of President Snow, the film struggles to captivate audiences. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of exposition that lack the gripping tension characteristic of the franchise.The choice to center the narrative around a young Snow feels misguided. While exploring the evolution of a villain can be intriguing, the execution here feels forced and fails to humanize the character. Donald Sutherland's charismatic portrayal in the earlier films is sorely missed, leaving a void that the new lead fails to fill convincingly.The film's production design is commendable, successfully recreating the dystopian world of Panem. However, the visual elements alone cannot compensate for the weak character development and a lackluster script. The absence of a strong female protagonist akin to Katniss Everdeen is particularly noticeable, depriving the story of the resilience and depth that defined the previous installments.Furthermore, the film's attempt to provide social commentary on privilege and power lacks subtlety, coming across as heavy-handed and didactic. The subtleties that made the original trilogy thought-provoking are sacrificed for a more straightforward narrative, diminishing the intellectual engagement that characterized earlier films.Despite a few redeeming moments, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" ultimately fails to capture the essence of its predecessors. Fans of the franchise may find it disappointing, as it struggles to live up to the legacy established by the original trilogy. While the film has its merits, it pales in comparison to the thought-provoking and emotionally resonant storytelling that made ""The Hunger Games"" a cultural phenomenon.","

But a few things were difficult to watch. Primarily that Lucy Gray was not the protagonist this series deserved. From a wavering southern bell accent (which vacillated wildly) to the near musical territory the movie wandered into, this HG prequel felt like a very long made for premium streaming exclusive. Redemption comes from Tom Blythe, who was phenomenal, but the third act dragged heavily and I found myself asking why he looked like Eminem in District 12. The odd love story between Snow and Gray wasn't helped by the sort of Gypsy bard rebel played by Rachel Zegler.The movie had its moments but I was personally removed from the story every time Zegler had a different accent or used some southern turn of phrase. To me it just fell flat but made canonical sense in what really happened to Snow that sent him down his capital path.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","coguzhan-99824","20 November 2023","As a long-time fan of the Hunger Games franchise, I approached the new ""Hunger Games"" with a blend of excitement and caution. Unfortunately, my caution was warranted. The film, from start to finish, felt like a tedious journey through a poorly constructed narrative.First and foremost, the characters in this iteration lacked depth and credibility. Their motivations were unclear, and their actions often felt random, contributing to a disjointed storyline. It was as if the script was generated by an AI like ChatGPT, lacking the human touch that usually brings characters to life.The overall quality of the film was underwhelming. From the CGI effects to the set design, everything seemed to be done with minimal effort and creativity. The dialogues were particularly disappointing, often bordering on nonsensical, which further detached me from the story.Moreover, the plot itself was a letdown. It neither honored the original Hunger Games spirit nor offered anything new or exciting. It was as if the producers simply relied on the franchise's name to carry the movie, without putting in the necessary work to make it stand out.In conclusion, Hunger Games is a forgettable addition to the franchise. It's a stark reminder that not all sequels or spin-offs live up to their names. For future projects, I hope more attention is given to developing engaging characters and a compelling narrative, the very elements that made the original Hunger Games so captivating.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","mikecart1","19 November 2023","The movie was pretty good overall - and much better than any expectations for a prequel given the recent history of movie franchises trying to milk more money out of a successful trilogy. The cast is well-done and the story overall isn't like Hunger Games 2 where it was just more or less a replay of Hunger Games 1. I like how the background is constructed in a way that gives information without going through endless boring plots and side plots of characters that aren't memorable.I would have given it a 9/10 (tying my rating for the original) if the ending was better linked to the first Hunger Games. While, a lot is implied by how the movie ends. I would have liked more linkage on Snow's health issues in the Mockingjay movies where he had poisoned himself in order to poison and kill all his enemies. Whether it be by the way he did in this movie or some other method, there should have been more hints that he was willing to hurt himself to wipe out all his enemies. Unless they are planning to make a sequel to the prequel, I think they could have added about 5 minutes of screen time to explain how exactly he became President Snow.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","dmay-76183","20 January 2024","Brutally long and uninspiring movie. The lead character is unbearable to watch. Her accent is something like an O'l southern accent mixed with a really poor Irish accent. Her facial expressions, and unnecessary singing made me ask myself several times how much longer is this movie. The worst part is I bought it instead of renting it.I enjoyed all of the other hunger games movies, the acting was better, the characters had better chemistry, the storyline flowed better. I don't know if they are going to make more movies to follow this one. However if they do I hope they get a new cast and director.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","AxrnW","20 November 2023","I was waiting for this movie for so long because of the backlash that Rachel Zegler had - due to her remarks about the previous Snow white movie - and I was waiting for her to prove how fantastic she is and how the world was putting her in a bad light for simply having an opinion!She proved that she is an outstanding actor, who has magnetism and beautiful vocals!I never read the book, but thoroughly enjoyed the other movies and now I feel as though this movie was one of my favourites, it interesting to learn how the whole games started off and how it became televised to the people of the Capitol.President Snows - younger back story - was also very interesting to discover and shows the viewers how he became as cold as his last name states.It's funny how love can make you go crazy and risk it all...But also risking it all for someone and then showing your true colours.. and then realising you didn't truly even know one another, when it's too late, can also make you go a bit insane also,Snow felt as though he wasted his time and energy and I get that, but he was never going to last with Lucy as she had a totally different, free-spirited mindset that would never have obided by the capitols rules.Very interesting story, go see it!!","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","vggnwmh","25 November 2023","Disjointed, unclear motivation, mannequins for characters, overly long. I had a real hard time following the evolving motivation of Snow and part three left me scratching my head. He betrays the rebels, acts in their defense and then .... I don't really know. The near final scene set near the cabin on the lake was emblematic of the disjointed story line. Snows final emergence as the cold villain we know from the sequels is not convincing. A waste of a few hours. Some good performances scattered throughout, Dinklage is solid as usual and the game show host is fun and Viola Davis's wardrobe and make up is the best thing about the movie.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","bm230199","17 November 2023","I think the best way to describe this film is disjointed. It felt like they spent too little time on each of the characters but at the same time scenes seemed to drag on and the dialogue was boring. There was no chemisry between the two main characters and their romance was high unbelievable but is the main point of the film. It jumps from the capitol, to the games, to district 12 so much I can't help but think it would've been better as a tv show so it could've properly been broken down into different parts. Some things were just highly unrealistic too such as a bunch of Capitol studens chanting to free a tribute? Never going to happen. Also Lucy trying to kiss Snow within what a daty of meeting him? Also how was there so little fighting or action in a film about people fighting to the death? Some plot points just didn't make sense like how on earth Snow sent a bird with his friend confessing treason then being upset when his friend was killed to the last 30 minutes of the film where the characers did a 360 and admitted killing people without telling us who. It had good potential and I liked he easter eggs to the later movies but overall missed the mark for me. Just go see The Marvels instead.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","leadinglimbou","17 November 2023","Honestly, I made an IMDb account to write a review for this movie after reading some other ones. Saw it opening night and I think it might be one of my favorite movies of the year. The casting was amazing, the story was super close to the book, the music beautiful. Everything about this movie was really well done. I read a couple of other reviews and I have to say that most who don't like this movie seem to never have like the hunger games in the first place. If you are a hunger games fan I really believe you'll enjoy this movie. The acting was superb -Snow was incredible and so was Lucy. I give it a 9/10 because there were some parts where it felt a little gimmicky and it was on the longer side. Overall, a super enjoyable movie. I'd definitely recommend if you liked anything about the original hunger games (books or movies). Idk how these reviews work but if you can lmk what you think.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","eve_dolluk","11 December 2023","The first Hunger Games with Jennifer Lawrence was a very good film. It was fresh and new and Katniss Everdeen was a great movie character.A side character in that trilogy ( 4 films ) was President Snow, this film is a prequel to the original films showing him in his youth before his rise to power.The film is split into 3 parts.Part 1 - is an introduction to Snow and his friends/fellow students and also the tributes of the 10th hunger games.Part 2 - is the 10th Hunger games
Part 3 - is how Snow starts his journey to becoming the looming dictator he becomes in the OT.This is why the film really fails to deliver.Part 1 is lacking in development and introduces way to many characters although the focus here is Snow and Lucy Gray Baird, her first name is ' Lucy Gray ' not just Lucy.Played by Rachel Zegler she is the antipathy of Katniss, her strengths are singing and charm centred around an aloof but colourful character.Of course Snow is mesmerised.Part 2 centres around the 10th Hunger games where viewing figures and interest have been waning to the point this could be the last. Thats right the central part of this show is just how lacklustre the Hunger Games have become. A fairly small old building is the arena for this and yes its dull and boring, this makes what should be a beautiful climax, just seem lifeless.Part 3 is a long winded prologue covering punishment for Snow his ostracism from the capitol and then his return... by this point however you may have stopped caring.Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage appear fleetingly, Viola steals the limelight every time. Tom Blyth is good as Snow, a snakey but transient young man. Zegler uses her singing talents well but is more of a romantic supporting interest than a winning hero.Dinklage I felt was underused as were the majority of the rest of the cast.Overall there is an interesting story there but it wasn't told in an interesting way and I can't think of any really good or stand out re watchable moments. It was very studio set/green screen throughout and it felt like there was little chemistry between the actors.A 5 or 6 out of 10 for me.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","parksiet","17 November 2023","The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is by far one of the best entries in The Hunger Games franchise! A perfect adaptation of the novel, it expands on its dark dystopian world with rich costumes, stunning art direction, an epic score, and a sense of scale and scope that's fitting for this prequel about the rise of President Snow. And it's so much richer than dystopian young adult adaptations are usually ever allowed to be! I'm struggling to remember the last time a prequel was this much better and more interesting than the rest of its franchise. I love the nuanced, darker story that is more of a character study than anything which was so well executed by returning director Francis Lawrence in this colder prequel. He brought new life to the franchise with his masterful take on Catching Fire, and did it once again with The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, delivering a darker, more sinister version of the Games through Snow's perspective that is ten times better than it has any right to be.Significantly more intimate and grounded than the previous Hunger Games movies (despite being longer than any of them and responsible for seeding all of their lore), The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is the rare prequel that manages to stand on its own two feet and still feel taller than the other stories it's ultimately meant to support.But the real star is the cast. They crush it. Rachel Zegler truly shines and is super captivating in this. If you thought she was good in West Side Story, just wait until you see her here! Plus she gets to show off her incredible singing skills multiple times! I really loved her here, she truly is a star on the rise. Her character Lucy Gray is very different from Katniss, (Katniss was a fighter forced to perform, Lucy Gray is a performer forced to fight) and the tense, twisty dynamics between Lucy and Tom Blyth's Coriolanus are a treat to watch. Tom Blyth is a standout, selling Snow's moral ambiguity/decay with such a subtle, nuanced, and gifted performance. Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage are powerhouses and wildly compelling, as they usually are. Davis' character in particular is so devious, and it's so marvelous to watch. Plus this film has one of the 3 best Jason Schwartzman performances of the year - he's hilarious in this!With high stakes, solid action, and killer performances, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a thrilling return to Panem, assisted by some excellent production design and the return of memorable motifs/themes in the musical score. I love that so many people who worked on the original films came back for this one, really helping to make it all feel cohesive with the other films (especially thanks to James Newton Howard's excellent score)! This is purely grand, epic storytelling. It's long for sure, but doesn't drag. It works well by doing something fairly different from the first series, taking on a unique story structure that most studios would try to separate into a two-part movie. But I'm so glad they didn't split this up, and it still came out as such a faithful adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel. I loved this film! My sister, who doesn't love movies, loved this film (said it's the longest she's ever been compelled by a movie)! It's genuinely a very fair candidate for the best film in The Hunger Games franchise, either as good as or better than Catching Fire! The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a magnificent film that not only excels in its own right, but also enriches the original franchise that is it now a part of. If you loved The Hunger Games, you can't miss this!It's the things we love most that destroy us.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","wkasprzyk","20 November 2023","The movie notably centers on Rachel Zegler, who appears to excel in every aspect. She portrays the most kindness, despite becoming from occupied district, winning without resorting to combat and effortlessly dodging crossbow bolts, she takes care of friend and even shares Snow's food with Snow... She sings the best and she can do it strong and proud even snakes seem to kill her in the moment.Regrettably, the first two acts lack bright sides, offering only mediocre or subpar elements. Mediocre music - bad plot; mediocre dialogs - bad characters; mediocre locations - bad jokes.The third act, while an improvement, feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the movie. In the end, the events that unfold don't even matter, because the clue is that Snow was always playing hardball.Anyway I can blind the eye to this nonsens and plot pointlessness and still rate it 3 starts, primarily due to the notable improvement in the third act..","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","emicka-93846","26 November 2023","The latest installment in the Hunger Games saga is a visual feast that captivates from start to finish. The aesthetics of the movie are nothing short of breathtaking, with meticulous attention to detail evident in both the costumes and architecture. The effects used throughout the film contribute to its overall immersive experience, bringing to life the dystopian world of Panem in a way that feels both futuristic and hauntingly plausible.One of the standout aspects of the movie is the introduction of Olivia and Rodrigo's song, adding a contemporary touch to the film's soundtrack. The incorporation of modern elements seamlessly blends with the dystopian setting, creating a unique and memorable atmosphere.The acting in the movie is stellar, with each cast member delivering a compelling performance. The casting choices are spot-on, bringing characters to life with authenticity and depth. The story itself serves as a captivating exploration of the origins of the Hunger Games and why the people of Panem tune in to watch these brutal competitions. It sheds light on the motivations and decisions that set the stage for the future tribulations faced by the districts.However, the narrative takes an unexpected turn with Lucy Gray's victory and the subsequent government response. While the film excels in portraying the evolution of President Snow, the transformation of another key character, Coryo, felt sudden and somewhat perplexing. The ambiguity surrounding his shift to evil leaves viewers questioning the overall message of the movie.The ending, unfortunately, left some viewers scratching their heads. The abruptness of Coryo's descent into darkness felt somewhat random, especially considering the film's focus on the gradual corruption of President Snow. The climax raises questions about the broader message, as it seems to suggest that achieving goals involves sacrificing morality and resorting to extreme measures.Despite these reservations, the movie provides an engaging and entertaining experience. The captivating storyline, impressive visuals, and strong performances make it a worthy addition to the Hunger Games universe. The decision to cast an attractive actor as the villain adds an interesting layer, making it challenging for viewers to completely despise the character. Nevertheless, the abrupt narrative shift in the concluding moments may leave some fans feeling a bit unsatisfied, longing for a more coherent resolution to the story of Panem's descent into darkness.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","michaelgerharz","18 November 2023","Rachel Zegler is a great singer but the whole singing parts just felt weird and forced. I was waiting for the movie to turn into a musical. Throughout the movie Lucy Gray has a guardian angel around her, giving her Spider-Man reflexes so she doesn't even have to fight. I call it Avoidant Mary Sue. Of course she doesn't have any flaws, just a kind person who does everything from the good of her heart. Someone you would never trust if you met her in real life, unless you're naive and inexperienced. In short, very badly written. The characters romance comes out of nowhere and moves so fast it felt like a comedic relief. The relationships between characters also abruptly change without any explanation whatsoever, turning them against each other. This is shown in Snow's character, the main villain in the series, who suddenly changes into a murdering psychopath.","

It felt like the book all over again. They let out some minor details, but it feels right and complete and easy to understand for everyone who hasn't read the book yet.

The characters, especially the female protagonist, lacked depth. The musical-like vibe, despite not being a musical, felt out of place, with an excess of songs. I read one review about excessive songs, and halfway through the movie, there were three, and I thought that the reviewer was exaggerating. But I kid you not, she sang at least 13 other songs in the other half. In the final scenes, the acting of the male protagonist was quite interesting, but I didn't understand the sudden change; there was no buildup.","

The film in itself is not bad but it is far too tightly screwed together it could use more immersion in the development of various characters. Even though the action is packed, it is still long drawn out and you can't help but look at your phone to see what time it is when you are sitting in the cinema. Tom Blyth plays the role of Snow fantastic, but I can't say this about Rachel Zegler, she makes the film seem like a musical, she generally just doesn't fit into the film as Lucy Gray, she lacks this ""bad ass"" thing that Katniss/Lawrence had. Overall, the film is nice to watch if you need something to ser when you're bored, but I can't recommend watching it in the cinema, it's not worth it.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","judealexharnett","17 November 2023","Having read the book less than two months ago it was more or less fresh in my mind. And to be fair it was a pretty faithful adaptation. There was some stiff left out but what was left out I didn't care too much for. There were a lot of positives. Great preformances on all front, especially from viola Davis who was the show stealer in my opinion. Corlionas and Lucy grays dynamic was just as good In the book and sejanus is portrayed just as much of an annoying twat as in the books. The soundtrack was really good too and Rachel zegler has an amazing voice. Jason schwartzman is great as lucky flickerman but he's no ceaser flickerman. My biggest issue is the pacing. It could have been a lot better. I wouldn't have been annoyed if it was split into two parts. The first two parts had pretty minimal issues but the last part felt really rushed. Still, snow lands on top is honestly one of the best ending lines ever. 8.7/10.","

It's an origin story of one of the characters, and it wasn't even that entertaining. It had so much potential, but was executed poorly. Not worth watching unless you particularly care for HG series. There's no action or thrill. It has it moments, but they're brief and rushed. Its all drama and character development. Typically I'm one to say a movie is better than most people say it is (I even liked the live action avatar Airbender movies after growing up on the cartoon!!)

Suprisingly, my boyfriend, who was so annoyed that he must go with me to the cinema for this one, ended up liking the movie ( rated it 8.5 ). I think the start od the movie was the worst part and the best one was part III. I also didnt like Rachel singing, but besides that she was a good performer as Lucy. Also kinda hoped for more Tigris.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","spencermcook","1 December 2023","Does this film fit cohesively within the Hunger Games franchise? Absolutely. The tone of this film is nearly identical to the rest; with its half-baked sets embodied by CGI, warm tones to portray the deceiving virtues of the Capital contrasted by cold tones to showcase the depleted nature of the districts, and the solo buildup of a character who expresses heroic mentalities. The problem that director Francis Lawrence runs into is trying to mimic Coriolanus Snow's journey with the story of Katniss Everdeen. The first 65% of the film is truly entertaining, however the predetermined outcome of this character is exposed by a choppy transition in the story arc in order to blend this film organically within the franchise. Tom Blyth gives a credible performance that is heightened by the fact that he's shown in 95% of the film, whereas Rachel Zegler pioneers the innovative approach of making this adaptation a musical. Similar to large IP franchises such as Marvel, DC, or Star Wars, there's an equal amount of moments to criticize as there are to enjoy, and I'm perfectly fine with that.","

The male lead is actually solid and hope he can save the series but she's got to go.So derivative of its origins I can't begin to explain. Basically the same cast of characters bastardized to be lesser versions of the original. I'm not saying the hunger games is Citizen Cane but it had its charms.

Fury of the Gods, West Side Story_2021; Viola Davis-The Woman King, Law Abiding Citizen and Peter Dinklage-Cyrano, Game of Thrones_tv.This is the origin story of Coriolanus Snow-Donald Sutherland's character in the original movies-so it is a prequel that covers how he came into power. Tom plays Coriolanus, a student rising in the ranks in the Capital. Viola is the President of Panem, with Peter as her next in command. The 10th annual Hunger Games are starting a new season and Tom has Rachel as his volunteer-the Capital calls them tributes. Tom is her mentor in the games but begins to have feelings for Rachel and wants her to actually win, which is not what Viola wants, so they tend to butt heads over protocol. FYI: In case you are wondering about the sub title in the name, Rachel likes to sing-hence the nickname Songbird-and Viola has a 20 foot tank of snakes that she has been experimenting with and uses them on occasions, when necessary. It's a little slow in parts but overall, it's a good origin story.It's rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing material and has a running time of 2 hours & 37 minutes.I would probably buy it on DVD.","

Thus, Snow betrays his friend out of nowhere. And Lucy Gray suddenly flees from Snow without it becoming clear why exactly. Lucy also acts VERY poorly. She is only concerned with being beautiful and charming in the film, you hardly see any emotion, pain or fear. She is just pretty, that's it. You don't believe her, she is not authentic. She seems to be competing in the Voice instead of the Hunger Games. Singing like she is a singer on stage. Instead of being afraid or emotional. Too bad, because her role is important. Jennifer Lawrence was so much better and more believable!!! Snow acted well, and Viola Davis was also excellent as an actress. But it wasn't clear to me why Snow ended up being evil. This is not well developed in the film. All by all, it was a bad movie, and the other parts were so much better. I really can't believe all the positive reviews.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","StrangeSleep","18 November 2023","Unlike so many movies of late, I found this Hunger Games prequel to be engaging, immersive, yet quite disturbing. I had not read the book deliberately, because I wanted to experience the film in its own right, rather than how faithfully it reproduced a written work. Regardless, it effectively chronicles the pivotal events in the nascent corruption of Coriolanus Snow.The horror of the actual Games is far more primitive, gritty and raw than before... much more like Thunderdome from the Mad Max franchise: ""Get to the weapons. Use them any way you can. I know you won't break the rules. There aren't any."" The sickness of this society is encapsulated by the fact that one of the Tributes is a young girl who appears to have Down's Syndrome. Try to wrap your head around that idea...I found the characters to be sufficiently developed for the purposes of the film's narrative. Folk music is interwoven into the movie, perfectly to effect: one of the main protagonists is a folk singer who expresses her emotions and defiance through song.The ""look and feel"" of this era of Panem is brilliant: a bizarrely familiar reimagining of mid-century modern motifs grotesquely blended with elements of the totalitarian architecture of the Third Reich. For those who know the actual photographic record of the latter, you will see numerous things in this film which echo that visual vocabulary, and not simply the sets.I'd recommend seeing this film: given the times we live in, it certainly is a thought-provoking journey.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","idaskansen","15 November 2023","Wow! I'm so impressed by everything about this movie, the acting, the camera work and of course amazing costume and makeup. It's a perfect adaption from the film, doesn't really leave out any characters or important details. Some characters are gone from the book but you don't think about it at all and nothing is missing.In the beginning I admit it's a little quick with everything that's happening but I think that's a choice and I agree with it for most part. A really great detail is also that it is divided in parts and that's really cool according to me.All actors are amazingly cast and they do a really good job. The one person that totally steals the show is of course Viola Davis, terrifying and amazing in every scene.Tom is stunning as a leading man and he really embodies Snow in all that he is.I want to recommend this movie to everybody and I can't explain my love for it.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","zkonedog","29 November 2023","""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is by no means a bad movie. It is entertaining, engaging, and has flashes of brilliance. The Hunger Games prequel also is an adaptation of a young adult novel--and such theme focuses may make or break your enjoyment of it.For a very basic overview, ""Songbirds & Snakes"" focuses on Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth), the individual who will ultimately become the Donald Sutherland-played villain of the originals. Mentoring District 12's Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler) in a very early Hunger Games iteration, Snow falls for her (or is that the other way around?) and the two form an unlikely pairing that will ultimately lead both of them in very different directions.As I mentioned, there were parts of this film that I truly did enjoy. In some ways, it is a star vehicle for Zegler, whose singing talents are truly special. Seeing such an early iteration of the Hunger Games competition is of course interesting, and there are a number of ""easter eggs"" for fans of the original films to smile at.However, I will argue that ""Songbirds & Snakes"" fails at its primary mission: to show the trajectory of Coriolanus Snow from well-meaning Panem student to the sneering Sutherland villain. The strange thing is, the film doesn't outrightly fail at this task--all (or at least most of) the steps are indeed present. But they are handled with a very YA sensibility befitting the novels they are based on. In other words, the themes and arcs of this movie are best invested by a tween, teen, or younger audience, I think. Some of the material is very much ""on the nose"", while at other times it comes off as a bit lacking in true follow-through of the Snow character mission other than ""well, we know he's going to become the big baddie, so..."".Granted, the original Hunger Games set largely has those YA approaches baked into it too, but the inclusion of Jennifer Lawrence's super-serious Katniss was a tonic (at least for me). As good as Zegler is as an entertainer, she is not in the Lawrence acting category (at least not yet).Perhaps others will not have as much of a ""sophistication"" problem with ""Songbirds & Snakes"" as I did. But other than never being bored, the flick failed to draw me into its key tenets of existence because I felt it was constantly shooting for only the approval of a much younger audience than I.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","jakeconant","21 November 2023","I just don't feel like it did anything to meaningfully justify its own existence. It's well-made, that's for certain, and the actors are trying extremely hard to believe in the world the filmmakers have put them in. But it just smells so...Hollywood. DOA. It's like looking at a corpse of a Hunger Games movie. Clearly, it's going to make a zillion dollars, especially internationally (I saw it in a semi-packed theater in Madrid). It's almost like what Disney is doing to Marvel -- inventing pre- and back-stories that actually don't need to exist because they add nothing to the canon, nor do they change the way you see the other movies. No additive comprehension. The Games themselves were much, much too short, and they solved the problem of the games themselves in a deus ex machina way that was deeply unsatisfying. I'm super impressed with Rachel Zegler, because she clearly is a talented musician who learned probably 10 different songs for this movie...but in the end, the whole thing feels like a borderline musical meant to appease an imagined audience consisting mostly of teenagers. In other words? Weirdly gimmicky. I found the whole thing boring, and kind of stale. Give it a pass. You'll be fine.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","sbweightman","18 November 2023","More of a political thriller than an action adventure, the story follows the creator of the new Hunger Games in three distinct parts. Good use of imagery and foreshadowing as it reuses the main themes from the original stories but with a fresh view. The story is good if a bit simplified and obvious at times, but it was enjoyable throughout due to the great acting from the main cast, the cracking country ballads and the use of contrast from the grand to the dilapidated in the scenery and settings. The Games themselves weren't as shocking or thrilling as they could have been, but were still entertaining to watch and the run-down nature of the arena fitted well within the post-war recovery setting.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","grant-jenkins","19 November 2023","This film has an interesting look and design. It relly feels like the past of this world where they haven't yet perfected the devious Hunger Games. But sooo much on-the-nose dialogue where characters only talk about the things they've done, in part, makes this a terrible script. And what is the story here, star-crossed lovers or rags-to-riches rise of a fascist dictator? The director doesn't know, so why should we care? Finally, if the plot is the latter, then it's really hard to care about the rise of a evil character. And Lucy Grey isn't that much better because she makes many questionable choices and not the ones she thinks are bad. Skip this film and rewatch the OG, which is almost a flawless script and film.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","georgewhittingham1","17 November 2023","I'll start off by saying I've never read the books, and nor should I have to! It's a film after all.The first 1/3 of the movie starts off really well. We're instantly transported into the world, we learn about and connect with our main character, and the plot is set up, ready to go, potentially greatness awaits.Unfortunately, when the actual games starts, the writing just goes downhill, where in the cinema I actually shook my head with disappointment several times. The overall quality does actually pick up around 2/3, but out ending then crashing down to an overall 6/10.The writing, like a lot of tv and cinema these days, just let's it down. Moments that could be poignant become laughable, and I also feel (despite its long run time) certain parts, particularly connecting with anyone but our protagonist, we're very rushed.Lastly, Rachel Ziegler just isn't a very good actor. Almost all of her lines are delivered in exactly the same way, which is a shame as our lead I actually thought did a really good job. Worth seeing, but not watching again.","

It felt so rushed. I can't stand Rachel Ziegler as lucy gray. She's just so harsh and stiff with the mannerisms and it feels very forced in the acting. I really didn't enjoy the singing in the movie either. I wish they touched more on Coriolanus and Sejanus' relationship. I didn't like the casting and felt the cast didnt fit the roles in the book. I wish it was more true to the book. The characters just felt empty and like nothing was behind them. I did however really like Tom bylth as Coriolanus he was the perfect snow.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","godasejal","29 November 2023","I'd love to provide you with a detailed review of ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes.""Suzanne Collins' return to the Hunger Games universe with ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" was highly anticipated, promising a prequel that would delve into the origins of the tyrannical President Snow and the early days of the Hunger Games. Set decades before Katniss Everdeen's time, this novel takes us back to the core of Panem's history, offering a deeper understanding of the world we came to know in the original trilogy.The story introduces us to a young Coriolanus Snow, whose life and aspirations are dramatically altered when he is assigned to mentor the tribute from District 12, Lucy Gray Baird, in the 10th Hunger Games. Snow's character development is central to this narrative, as we witness his moral compass and ambitions shape under the weight of societal expectations and personal choices.Collins skillfully paints a bleak and captivating picture of the Capitol, detailing its opulence and disparity from the districts. The grim reality of life outside the Capitol is portrayed vividly, showcasing the struggle for survival and the bleak circumstances faced by the oppressed districts. The author succeeds in creating a palpable sense of tension and unease, establishing the foundation for the totalitarian regime familiar to readers of the original series.The introduction of Lucy Gray Baird, a charismatic and enigmatic tribute, adds depth and intrigue to the storyline. Her mysterious nature and captivating performances on stage during the Games provide a compelling contrast to Snow's calculated demeanor. The dynamic between Snow and Lucy Gray drives much of the novel, presenting a complex interplay of manipulation, loyalty, and survival instincts.One of the strengths of this prequel is its exploration of the moral gray areas within the characters. It presents a thought-provoking examination of the circumstances that can shape a person's choices and values, blurring the lines between right and wrong. Through Snow's internal conflicts and rationalizations, Collins challenges readers to consider the nature of power, privilege, and the consequences of one's actions.However, despite its intriguing premise and character study, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" has been met with mixed reactions. Some readers found it challenging to empathize with a young President Snow, while others appreciated the nuanced portrayal of a character who eventually becomes the series' primary antagonist. The pacing of the novel has also been a point of contention, with moments that feel drawn out juxtaposed with bursts of intense action.Additionally, while the book offers insights into the creation of the Hunger Games and the Capitol's early days, it might not satisfy those expecting the same adrenaline-fueled narrative as the original trilogy. The absence of the rebellion's fervor and the societal critique present in the previous books could leave some Hunger Games enthusiasts wanting more.In conclusion, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a daring exploration of the Hunger Games universe, providing a deeper understanding of President Snow's character and the origins of the Games. Collins' narrative choices and her ability to humanize a character traditionally viewed as a villain contribute to a thought-provoking read. However, its departure from the familiar tone of the original series and its divisive portrayal of a young Snow might not resonate with all fans. It's a book that provokes discussion and offers a new perspective on the complexities of human nature and power.","

If there was anything negative to say it would be I wanted a little more backstory, but I still thought every character was great and well acted. From start to finish it doesn't have any weak moments, and each scene feels like it has a purpose.

I still don't understand the ending at all. Snow didn't seem to lose his mind. He just seemed to be turned into a being of pure evil in the last 10-15 minutes of this USELESS 2.5 HOUR MOVIE.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","mishahaynie","10 January 2024","I'm not a Hunger Games fan, but this installment fell short for me, earning only two stars. As a newcomer to The Hunger Games movies, I found this prequel to be unnecessarily violent. Despite being rated PG-13, it showcased more violence, bloodshed, and killing compared to several R-rated movies I've seen, raising concerns about its appropriateness.The movie was not only gruesome and brutal but also left an uncomfortable impression. The atmosphere depicted a world where everyone turns on each other, devoid of characters to genuinely root for. This lack of relatable protagonists made the entire experience cringe-worthy and depressing.While I acknowledge that the themes align with the book series, the level of discomfort surpassed my expectations. Exiting the theater, my friends and I shared a collective feeling of unease. If the subsequent movies continue to portray such intense violence and the bleak depiction of humanity turning on itself, I may choose to skip them altogether.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","CANpatbuck3664","25 November 2023","I didn't give myself over to Songbirds & Snakes immediately. The movie certainly had my attention and I think the opening was very strong in establishing Coriolanus as a complicated protagonist and setting him down his path to both his triumph and later his destruction. It took me a while to warm up to Lucy Gray, she was too feisty and too finely geared to make her likeable. But her willingness to trust Snow instead of just being whiny and mistrustful and her not too squeaky clean sense of morality wore me down. Her character picks up steam after the games are done and by the end, I was rooting for her. My biggest problem with the original series was how selfish and petulant Katniss could be and Songbirds & Snakes flips the formula by asking us to root for the villain. One of my friends suggested a House of Cards style show just showing Snow's rise to power and S&S showed the potential and promise that kind of project.I hadn't seen either Tom Blyth previously but to follow Donald Sutherland in this role couldn't have been easy. I was quite impressed with his commanding presence and how well he captured Snow's charm and conversely his ruthlessness. He definitely brought some humanity to the character and he conveys slow descent well. Rachel has a ton of energy as Lucy Gray and she's good at being vulnerable in the beginning and being coy & mysterious near the end. Viola Davis, Peter Dinklage and Jason Schwartzman are the heavy hitters in the supporting cast and I enjoyed them all. Viola comes on strong at the start (could the obviously evil character turn out to be evil?) but her performance fits and Dr. Gaul transforms into a formidable enemy by the end.I also want to congratulate this movie for putting more of a focus on the animosity between the Capitol and the Districts. There's a lot more anger and venom between the two sides and the bitterness adds to the stakes. They also do a good job of showing how disorganized the games could be in their beginning cycles. This version of the Hunger Games is much less glamorous, the tributes are barely suitable, the mentors are only in it for themselves and the citizens of the Capitol barely care. It adds to the bleakness of the festivities and how they would eventual fuel another rebellion which is important in where the story will eventually finish with the Katniss saga.I did have some problems with this movie, but they were mostly minor. Songbirds & Snakes relies on some plot contrivances and the film can't help but being a little precious when it's winking at elements from the original trilogy. This is something that isn't unique to Songbirds & Snakes but wouldn't it be nice if it could have been avoided? But the easiest and most obvious problem is that S&S feels a little overproduced. It's been pruned and tweaked for maximum power several times over and it robs it of some of it's spontaneity. I still really enjoyed it but I couldn't help but feel like I was being manipulated a little bit.I really didn't expect much going into this movie. I saw the original trilogy and read the books but I considered The Hunger Games finished and I moved on. I was blown away by how intricately packed and well made this prequel was. Judging by the other user reviews, I might in the minority but Songbirds & Snakes builds on the mythology while staying true to the spirit, the film shapes Coriolanus Snow into a layered and engaging character/villain and reignites the fire for this universe. I'm somewhere between an 8.5-9/10 but I'd wholly recommend this and unless you're extremely attached to the original trilogy, I'd be surprised if you walk away from the theatre without something to discuss or a new appreciation for this franchise. To Suzanne Collins, Francis Lawrence and the creative team, Bravo!","

Showing the earlier years of Coriolanus Snow who was the president in the previous films. And his attribute Lucy Gray which she was picked for the tenth Hunger Games.The film follows Snow as he sees society in the dystopian world struggling to live. While Lucy Grays perspective she is fighting for survival. The plot is good. The first hour or so has Lucy going through the Hunger Games and surviving. While last hour follows Snow going through the districts as a soldier looking for Lucy. And dealing with a rebellion.It has a great cast ensemble. Rachel Zegler performance stole the show. The script and direction does feel overlong which has a lot of boring and slow moments. The action sequences is decent and forgettable. May not be the best film in the series. It is not the worst.","

Not that I was a good past in any way shape or form.This movie on it's own though, if we don't look at the other Hunger Games movies, does not do good. The only reason why it is an okay movie is because of it's prequels and sequels. This movie as an independent movie was not good.Casting was poorly done and so was the acting.

All four films every single cast member was brilliant in there own right.Fast forward to this prequel and to put it bluntly it's a shambles, The cast is just terrible.No cohesion between anyone in any scene, they seem to build a character and then you dont see them for an hour if not ever again in the film.Flashback to the first films and Jennifer Lawrence can't really sing but is subtle in her singing that it seems natural she knows she can't sing so tones it down to something bearable. Now Rachel Zegler on the other hand thinks she can sing and it's just terrible every scene in which she sings a song is unbearable, plus she isn't a great actress at all, I just see it as they have rode the curtails of a major movie which was made what it is by great actors and actresses to promote up and coming actors and actresses.Snows character in this film didn't make any sense, having seen him magnificently portrayed by Donald Sutherland to seeing how he is portrayed in this film is just mind boggling, maybe its because Donald is a brilliant actor who knows.The film is supposed to be about the games and for me wasn't enough scenes actually about the games.Overall I would say if this was the very first Hunger Games film in the franchise then they wouldn't of managed to make another 3 movies or a prequel movie after it.","

However, the absence of exploration into Lucy Grey's character, possibly related to Katniss Everdeen, felt like a missed opportunity. Initially thinking Snow was her father added to the confusion. The focus solely on Snow's story left Lucy Grey's role largely unexplored, and her country-like singing style seemed out of place, disrupting the movie's flow.

The movie leans heavily on shallow acting and a fairly simplistic musical style that might find an audience among certain viewers, but for me, it didn't quite click. Spending three hours on it left me wanting more. I was expecting a deeper level of storytelling and quality, especially considering the high bar set by previous installments in the series. While it might resonate with those seeking more straightforward entertainment, it lacked the intricate storytelling and character depth that made the earlier movies so compelling.

The hunger games themselves are great but then the second half of the film is a total contrast to the first and it's a shame that we see both the blossoming of Lucy gray baird and corialanus relationship in the same film.There's some superb songs in this and the soundtrack is great. Good to see why snow subconsciously hates 'katniss' almost straight away. I wonder if Lucy gray Baird survives. Interesting to see if there will be any more installments.","

He became en empty villain character- no complexity, no human element whatsoever.The Hunger Games has an important place in literature and film because it speaks a message to young people about fairness, power and kindness to others but this message was on completely lost in a stupidly rapid, thin narrative.A bit embarrassing tbh.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","rechtienejalec","28 November 2023","I was pleased by this movie. This movie was probably the darkest Hunger Games yet, likely due to its more archaic technology used relative to the previous films. The acting was goods. Say what you want about Zelger, but her acting in this film was definitely a highlight. This film also gives us a better look at the function and reasoning behind this autocratic government, which is build under the principle that ""humans are inherently violent, and we need to be reminded of who we are."" This movie is not flawless though. There are 2 major flaws with this movie: 1) An overly confusing plot, and 2) Subpar story arcs. The plot was a lot like Oppenheimer, where it is a 3 act structure, yet the most action happens in the second act, and the third act is the aftermath. With Oppenheimer though, it at least remained grounded through the entire movie with its philosophical and ethical questions. In this Hunger Games movie, the third act seems to diverge into something really weird with not much direction, and it really only makes sense when it is over. Now to Snow's story arc; it is completely lopsided. This movie is supposed to be a villain origin story, yet we see him as a protagonist all the way until the very end, with not much really much leading up to it, other than maybe a few warning signs. Lucy Grey's story arc is dull too. Why does she just all the sudden leave and try to kill Snow? Her purpose really was as a prop to Snow's already flawed story arc. There doesn't seem to be that character that you can really follow. Overall though, it is a good movie that is definitely worth a watch. The story is gripping, the villain is absolutely crazy (the scientist), and the dystopian themes are very convincing where you almost find yourself rationalizing the tyrannical government.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","GusherPop","18 November 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a prequel to the movie that launched the franchise, focusing on the origins of Panem's authoritarian leader Coriolanus Snow. The film is split into three chapters, delivering a trifecta of overwrought, overacted, and overlong. The adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel explores the Hunger Games' origins and Snow's descent into the dark side. However, the new Snow, played by British actor Tom Blyth, is a bland construct, joining other privileged young Capitol residents as mentors to the youths chosen to compete and die as tributes. Snow is tasked with capturing Lucy Gray Baird, a talented actress from District 12. Snow is captivated by her talent and plans to help her survive the competition. However, he must navigate the eagle-eyed masterminds, Casca Highbottom (Peter Dinklage) and Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis), who resembles Cruella de Vil in her appearance and line delivery. Lucy's success will be crucial in the film's success. ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a thrilling prequel based on Suzanne Collins' 2020 novel, focusing on Coriolanus Snow's rise to power. The film showcases Tom Blyth's transformation from a moneyed pretty boy to a clear-eyed manipulator, showcasing Snow's transformation from a destined greatness to a manipulator intent on crafting his fate. The film's gripping performances, including Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Snow, make it a captivating watch. Dr. Volumnia Gaul emphasizes the importance of creating memorable spectacles, with Viola Davis playing a chic, sadistic character with the right amount of camp, and costume designer Trish Summerville's striking creations benefiting her. Snow's dark side is revealed in ""The Peacekeeper,"" a bold departure from previous chapters. The film moves from the austere Capitol to a pastoral forest setting, creating a romantic and dangerous atmosphere. The 157-minute film slows and quiets down, allowing for tension between two people who trust each other. Lucy Gray's folksy charm is used effectively, and the energy in the film is balanced by the lush, romantic, and dangerous atmosphere. ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a suspenseful prequel to Coriolanus's long-standing belief that snow always lands on top.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","lolacauneac","17 November 2023","Why is everyone pronouncing it wrong in the movie?Too much singing. I don't know what's wrong with the girl's jaw. No chemistry between the leads.I liked the boy's performance in some scenes. Towards the end you kind of see him finally ""bloom"", only to hear the real Snow say the phrase ""It is the things we love most, that destroy us"", and have the illusion shattered. He didn't manage to get at the same level as the previous actor. But I don't think it was the actor's fault, he is very good in my opinion. I believe it was the directing that was misguided, following the book a bit too much.The Hunger Games books were very badly written. The movies I adore. Watched them a hundred times.","

If it was broken up in half it would have been more enjoyable and the character development would have been better instead of what we got. I did enjoy it with my wife, but Hollywood needs to slow it down in order to gain another motion picture hit.Snow's character doesn't feel like he's getting darker as in the book but feels more like a crying child who isn't getting his own way with no major change in his mindset to life with the hunger games. There are some additions in the movie that has nothing to do with the book so anyone claiming its faithful needs to reread it again.Enjoyable for a one-time watch but that's all.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","IndridC0ld","9 January 2024","Films that epitomize the essence of movie-making often begin with a compelling story. ""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is no exception, boasting an outstanding narrative alongside remarkable acting, producing, and cinematography that immerse you in its world. Although the film starts somewhat slowly, this cleverly serves as a plot device to foster empathy with the main characters, allowing us to see reflections of our own choices and dilemmas on the screen. Have you ever sacrificed something you love for a necessity? Have you made decisions that altered the course of your life? This movie explores these questions and more over its engaging two and a half hours. It reminds me of films like ""Titanic,"" which don't just transport you away from your life but place you in another's shoes, prompting you to contemplate your own reactions in similar situations. For those who appreciate the preceding works, this film is a solid choice, paying a subtly ingenious tribute to its predecessors. It is replete with plot twists that cleverly subvert expectations. Special mention must go to the young actress McKenzie Lansing, who portrays a villainous character with a pitchfork. Though her role is brief, it is intensely visceral and memorable. In conclusion, this film truly encapsulates the author's vision for an engaging sequel.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Venture825","21 November 2023","I had heard many mixed reviews about this film, but since I am a fan of the series, and reading the book when it came out, I decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed.The film is very faithful to the book, although the first part felt a bit off the side to me, I thought the film as a whole flowed well. The acting felt rather irritating at first, but I got used to it within the first part. Another con I found was that I also thought it would've worked better if it was a TV Series. There would've been more of an opportunity to actually go into depth about each character, because it didn't feel like we actually bonded with any of the characters, apart from Sejanus but even then in the end he turned about to be a bit of a jerk.Although I found it enjoyable, definitely too violent for a 12A, but the screenplay was entertaining, the cinematography was good. Worth a watch if you're a longtime fan.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","KFstudios2009","18 November 2023","The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is the prequel to The Hunger Games, were they show us the first original beginnings of the games. Everything was less technological and looked more like a Gladiator arena, and here I could really feel that they were fighting to survive, the connection between the tributes was really strong, and they made that danger feeling much stronger in here, then in the original movies. It was also about the story of President Snow, how he started as a young man that had plans for a bright future, but ended with an evil path, with rage and madness. His story, and how his rage was evolving, was showed greatly, with complete understanding. The movie itself, did have dominating pros, but could have fixed some things. The pros, first of all, was amazing storytelling. They distributed the story in three parts, each chapter about a specific topic. I liked the prequel best from the franchise because it was richer story. In the originals, they focused mostly on one topic, but here, they included more of everything. Story, feelings and character development. President Snow as a character was amazingly performed by Tom Blyth, as a lost boy of perfection and squareness. Rachel Zegler as the songbird, Lucy Gray Bird, was the movies mystery. She was like an incomplete book, and made her more an interesting character. Rachel Zegler took her role, and personally, she is a very good singer, she is very pretty, but her acting is decent. Her acting could be better, her expressions could look more realistic. Her songs were good, though, they were mostly about the society and people of district twelve, and gave me a bigger understanding of their culture. The first Hunger Games was ok, but it always missed a puzzle. It didn't really explain the nature of the country, society and culture, something they did in this part, and made it finally a complete picture. Good scenography, editing and action sequences. The Hunger Games fights were very entertaining, very barbaric, and some of the kills were pretty well made, with good dramatical scenes and so. They could focus a little bit on the dialogues, more originality, even though it was good enough. The beginning with an impressive intro ended with a good, dramatical outro, and closed the movie complete. To conclude, this is the best Hunger Games so far, and I hope maybe some day the story will continue in a similar way as this one.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","srundkvist","21 November 2023","The movie portrays snow incredibly inaccurately. He has so much more depth than the movie shows. He is very young when the movie/book takes place and it shows when reading but not in the movie. It makes sense since the story has been condensed into one 2 hour and 40 minute long movie, I wish they would have made it two, two hour movies.Coriolanus Snow is a very calculated young kid but not like the movie portrays. In the movie he seemingly goes out of his way to cheat while in the book he does to accidentally or as an afterthought, he doesn't intend to but he does and then tries to justify it.Coriolanus is not a ""cold blooded killer"" despite how the movie portrays him. I've heard people call him that before. I think that when he runs away with Lucy, the reality of what he's doing starts to set in and to justify him wanting to leave and go back, his mind convinces him that she has figured everything out and is trying to kill him.Later when he goes back to the capitol and he starts looking for ways to improve the hunger games, I don't think he actually believes the hunger games to be the best solution. I think he sees the hunger games as the only solution. He knows that the children In the games are innocent and that they are real human beings, but he also believes that without the hunger games the capitol will be poor and he will have to go back to living like he and Lucy were planning to and that's his worst nightmare.Whenever he kills someone (in the book) he is finding a reason as to why it's justified and the reason is always for his personal gain, not because he simply wanted them dead. So in his mind he is most likely justifying the games as the only way for him to not go on to live ""a poor lifestyle"" again. It's okay to keep the hunger games going because it ensures that he doesn't have to ""fraternise"" with lower class people and it ensure that he won't fall in love with someone like Lucy Gray again.Coriolanus is all about power and control. Lucy Gray is his polar opposite. Coriolanus expresses how he felt that he lost control around Lucy Gray because he was in love with her. He then also explains how he never wants to feel that again and that if i is to have children it will be with someone he hates so that they can't control him.Even while Lucy Gray was in the arena he only wanted her to survive because he wanted her to stay in the capitol with him and not because he wanted her to live to see her family again, he wanted her because he loved her, but he didn't love her enough to become a part of her world.This movie is way to condensed to do the story justice, if only it had been two movies.TLDR: Snow is not a cold blooded killer who actively tries to cheat in the hunger games to win. He is a thoughtful kid obsessed with his own personal gain and wealth and he sees the hunger games as the only option to obtain that.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","siderite","14 December 2023","I blame it on Lucy Gray, a character so annoyingly righteous and vigorously rebellious that it was very difficult to connect to anything she touched. Fixing just this character would have made this film close to greatness, because almost everything else was good. The casting, the acting, the sets, the story.Tom Blyth was great, Viola David too. Most other characters were filler, but they were cast well and did their job. As opposed to the original trilogy of films, this felt more grounded, more mature. It wasn't perfect, but I enjoyed the film.There were three parts of the movie, the third felt the most rushed and frankly I would have probably liked the film more if it were not part of it. It would have also brought it to a normal length; I hate these modern three hours productions. If you can't tell your story in 2 hours, that's a problem. The story was intriguing, documenting in a tense and oppressive way the rise of a villain, I think one of the most entertaining types of tales out there, but the rushed third part muddled that a bit.I can't believe I am saying this, but this deserved a split into two films. As such, you are left with a bitter aftertaste, like someone took something that you felt had coming from you. Enough to turn one into a villain.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","masonfisk","7 December 2023","A new entry in the franchise is now a prequel (taking place 10 years after the first Hunger Games) as we follow the rise of President Snow (essayed by Donald Sutherland in the first series) as a young man, Tom Blyth, who has seen the worse of the war alongside his sister, Euphoria's Hunter Schafer, but now live in the bustling metropolis of Panem awaiting news if he's won the coveted Plinth prize which his family desperately needs since their finances are on the wane. To add more stress, the new Hunger Games are upon them & the ratings are down so the game makers, Oscar winner Viola Davis & Peter Dinklage, will introduce to this new tourney having the contestants interact directly w/their mentors w/Blyth partnered w/Rachel Zegler (already tagged as someone to watch since when her name's announced she flings a snake in a rival's blouse & sings in defiance to her nomination). What follows is another battle royal (sorry since the Hunger Games were always pegged as American copies of that notorious Japanese classic) w/most of the gameplay located to one environment as we wait to see if Zegler will pull off a win. Francis Lawrence wisely returns back to the fold after directing 3 previous entries already & his knowledge of the material works well enough to mount something familiar which still manages to rankle some genuine tension & disgust at the extreme politics seen on screen (maybe something The Phantom Menace wanted to do?) w/the performances fine & flinty which makes me wonder if there's enough fire in Suzanne Collins' belly to put out more installments to be filmed.","

I loved the feel that this Layout gave the overall film.First Act - Introduction to Various Notable Characters and Other Minor Characters, introduction to this World they have Created on Screen, and the Introduction to the Plot that is to Unfold.Second Act - The Actual Games themselves and the dynamics going on within/outside of the games.Third Act - I really Loved this, it just had a ""oh, we're still going"" vibe and had nice relaxing moments as well as more intense moments. Also, you could subtly see the change of Coriolanus Going more and more into Ruthlessness.2a. 👌 Then we have 5 Top Notch Performances by Tom Blyth, Rachel Zegler, Viola Davis, Peter Dinklage and Josh Andres Rivera as Sejanus Plith.2b. 🤐 Look I am by no means a Rachel Zegler Stan at all, her Sheer Ability in her Acting and Accent were Very Good and at times, her Singing Ability is Quite Something.3.

I had to Adjust my eyes multiple Times to take in what I was witnessing. 👀 👌5. (One of my Favourite Scenes) Near the End when Coriolanus picks the Gun up and says ""No more loose Ends"" Lucy Gray - ""Besides me"" Coriolanus - ""You wouldn't Tell anyone?"" Lucy Gray - ""Course Not"". And then the Look 😶. I Loved that Scene.6. 🗽 The Very Ending with Coriolanus Snow finally coming into his own and will become the Future Gamemaker.7. 🔊 (Bonus) The Sound Design was very good, particularly, the Birds when people are hung. The sound of the Ceiling Speakers and Side Speakers were travelling all around the Auditorium.Overall, Excellent Story, Performances and Stunning Production.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","r96sk","12 January 2024","I was thoroughly enjoying this... until it absolutely nosedives during the latter half.'The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes' starts off so strongly, continuing at a pleasant pace as it encompasses the Hunger Games itself. However, from the end of the event it truly does drop off a cliff out of nowhere. The film gives you a major high of action with the games, then drops the tempo down to such a slow first act-esque pace that it feels extremely tacked on.I did enjoy the cast throughout, mostly. Tom Blyth is excellent, first time I've seen him properly in a film and I was very impressed; though even his performance suffers with the aforementioned, which for him is from the point that he becomes The Real Slim Shady, seemingly (his originally look is so much better). Still, I'm eager to see that guy act further.Rachel Zegler is largely good, though does chew the scenery quite a bit in parts; predominantly when singing. Viola Davis is great, while Peter Dinklage is underused but still a positive. Jason Schwartzman and Josh Andrés Rivera, meanwhile, are solid enough supports.Just a shame about the final act. It's not necessarily that bad in itself, but to lower the pace that sharply after such prolonged thrill is a recipe for disaster. So much so that it makes the whole part drag hard, or perhaps 'twas just so for me?","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Chalice_Of_Evil","16 November 2023","I never read the books the original films, or this one, were adapted from. Consequently, I was somewhat lost at times and it almost felt as though this prequel needed its *own* prequel since characters acted like/referred to things as if we should know WHY they acted that way/what they were talking about. This is where book-readers will have an advantage over non-book-readers, as they'll *know* why certain characters are acting the way they do with others, etc. Of course, the downside to being a book-reader is that you'll no doubt be overly critical about every little detail, things you imagined differently, changes made, and things left out or added in. The benefit I had was judging this movie solely based on its own merits, coming into it fresh and with little idea of what would be happening (other than seeing the origin of how Snow turned evil).The movie's broken up into three parts titled 'The Mentor', 'The Prize' and 'The Peacekeeper'. Tom Blyth as a pre-Donald Sutherland version of Coriolanus Snow proves himself a capable leading man, as his character goes through quite the journey in the film and he rises to every occasion, playing all the different facets of Snow's personality in his early life. He starts out as someone whose main motivation is a monetary prize, but then this 'rebel' (who's referred to as such on more than one occasion) becomes invested for more personal reasons in the survival of the tribute he's selected to play mentor to: Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). I feel some have been unfairly critical of Zegler's performance, letting the things she's said in interviews (that've rattled some feathers...but have absolutely *nothing* to do with how she plays her character here) colour their judgement. I personally thought she held her own against Blyth's Snow admirably. As Lucy Gray describes herself, she's 'not made of sugar', and this becomes abundantly clear during her introduction when she drops a snake down the back of a girl's dress. Then later, during Lucy Gray's first meeting with Coriolanus, she eats a petal off the white rose he presents her with (which definitely leaves an impression).People have complained about 'too much singing' in the movie (but it's RIGHT THERE in the title: 'The BALLAD of SONGbirds & Snakes'), but don't be scared of the singing...the movie's not a 'musical' like some have made it out to be. While Zegler certainly puts the 'song' in 'songbird' by providing the majority of the film's soundtrack, it's part of her character (and actually an important plot point). Plus, she can really hold a tune...so why the complaining? It'd be one thing if she sang BADLY, but she gives the songs her all, putting emotion/feeling into every one (and it's not over-polished, which is appreciated). The film rests mainly on these two actors' shoulders, and I personally found their scenes together to be the most compelling parts of the movie. Lucy Gray starts out not trusting Coriolanus, but he shows her on more than one occasion that he isn't without heart and gradually she grows to trust him, as they work together to ensure her survival in the Hunger Games.Another stand-out in the cast is Jason Schwartzman as Lucretius ""Lucky"" Flickerman, weatherman and aspiring magician (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Stanley Tucci's Caesar Flickerman from the original films), as his reporting the weather while kids are dying in the arena provides some morbid humour at one point (really, he's the only source of 'humour' in the film). Head Gamemaker, Dr. Volumnia Gaul is a frightful sight (her makeup's seriously unnerving) and you can't help but wonder if the reason everyone's so hungry is because Viola Davis keeps devouring all the scenery. Her rainbow of snake muttations are a colourful way to take out the stragglers when there is only a handful left. Speaking of, I remember the acting for the tributes who weren't Katniss (whose name I was surprised to learn the origin of in this film) or Peeta in the original films was pretty sketchy...and it hasn't really improved this time around. Other than one or two who make the most of their limited screentime (that we either feel sorry for, as they're practically Dead Meat Walking, or are shown to be more three-dimensional than they first appeared), the majority feel barely above CW teen drama levels in the acting department.Much better are other supporting characters such as Dean Casca Highbottom (Peter Dinklage, continuing to play characters who drink and know things...that is until the end when he *doesn't* know something, which proves fatal), Sejanus Plinth (Josh Andrés Rivera, playing a friend of Coriolanus and a fellow mentor who won't stand for the Games' barbarity...which also proves fatal) and Tigris (Hunter Schafer, playing cousin to Coriolanus...or 'Coryo' as she calls him, who I found particularly interesting to watch and really enjoyed her scenes with Blyth's Snow). Something this movie has definitely stepped up from the previous films is the brutality of the Games, as there's no shortage of death (so don't get too attached to anyone). I also found the themes explored in the movie felt more 'mature' and there was a complexity that you might miss the intricacies of if you're not paying attention.Although it may seem like the film loses some steam in its third part, it's necessary to show that things aren't all fine and dandy after the Games are over with. The relationship between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray is not one that's wrapped up in a nice neat little bow. There's an open-endedness that may frustrate some people, but the important thing is that by the film's end...The President Snow of the future has been born/created. On the whole, I found the movie held my attention throughout (not a small feat considering its runtime) and I liked it better than the first, third and fourth previous films. Only the second film, Catching Fire, would I rank higher than this one.","

The pacing was rather odd. At times it would feel like the film was rushing through scenes and then at other times, spending way too much time on scenes that don't really further the narrative or show off the characters in any meaningful way.The performances were good but the side characters performances stood out so much more than our primary protagonist.The production and costume design was great, as was the soundtrack.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","apereztenessa-1","19 November 2023","In 2008, Suzanne Collins took the young adult world by storm with the publication of The Hunger Games, soon turned into a global phenomenon movie franchise with the first entry coming out as early as 2012. With hindsight, it's the political vision infused in The Hunger Games that is most striking. Panem reflects a vision of the United States where a small group of economic, intellectual and artistic elites live extravagantly in rich cities, devoid of true human values, while the rest of the country lives in poverty, working hard and sustaining traditional values and human authenticity. Whether you share this vision or not, it is hard to disagree that it reflected well-ahead of its time a political view that millions of Americans (and others in the world) would embrace a few years later.Now, eight years after the last installment in the series, a prequel is released that tells the origin story of the franchise villain, Coriolanus Snow. Let it be said that the film succeeds in building an engaging story about the development of this character, one that is full of action, excitement and well-crafted character development. However, more than Snow's origin story, it's the origin story of Panem and the Capitol that catches our attention, given the strength of the political message in the first four films. In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, we are presented with a Capitol that looks very different from the one seen in the previous films. Instead of the extravagant town reflective of liberal cities in the US, we see a grey city, built in massive concrete structures, that is highly reminiscent of the image we have of Soviet or Eastern European communist cities in the 70's and 80's. The structures, the clothes, the sculptures towering over giant squares, the cars, the propaganda posters are all reflective of communist imagery. That is ultimately the subversive political message infused into this prequel: the behavior and decadence of the Capitol (and by extension of liberal American cities) has its roots in communism. For anyone who understood the political message in the first four films and its connection with some political views in America, this conclusion is not unexpected, but it is certainly a bit disturbing to see it so prominently displayed in such a mass-market oriented movie targeting the young.In the spirit of open-mindedness and democratic values, one can still choose to appreciate and enjoy the film without agreeing with its political message (something many are unable to do these days). There is for example no doubt that the Soviet imagery creates an amazing visual experience, in particular with the representation of a hunger games arena that is visually impactful and very different from the one in previous installments.Ultimately, The Hunger Games is an exciting franchise and this new installment is no exception. And whether you agree with its political vision or not, history has told us that it has had a way of being ahead of its time, and therefore that it is worth listening to.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","cdjh-81125","17 November 2023","I've always had a soft spot for the Hunger Games franchise since it was the first time I made an effort to read the books before the films came out. I think the first two films are genuinely fantastic which still holds up really well despite the overindulgent 3rd and 4th films disappointing me. I've been excited for this film since it was announced cause I just love the world that's been created for this series and I really enjoyed the book of Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. While the film itself isn't free from all the book's shortcoming, I still really enjoyed seeing another movie set in this world.The great world building from the original trilogy continues to be a massive positive here. I loved the retro-futuristic aesthetic and this film manages the capture the inherent terror that comes from this premise. This is something the f original excelled at and none of the sequels quite recaptured. The tension leading up to the start of the games is so well captured, it's terrifying to put yourself in the situation of these characters and it's exceedingly more gritty and graphic than any of the other movies. There were more genuinely disturbing moments than I expected there to be, even having read the book, and it's by far the darkest entry in the franchise.I really liked the tone of this movie. It's a villain origin first and foremost and the script takes its time to develop this twisted romance and how it leads to the downfall of Snow as a person. We're definitely not watching Jennifer Lawrence's character and Tom Blyth does such a good job at giving small hints to the ferocious nature of this character. He's great and so is Rachel Zegler in what I think may be my favourite performance from her. She's a great singer, (we knew that from West Side Story) which this character does a lot of, she's great in all the action scenes and her chemistry with Blyth phenomenally realises the growing wedge between this pair until it comes to ahead very well I think.Like the novel, I do think it's a bit long in the tooth. At over 2 and a half hours there's a lot of material being explored and it can make the first two acts feel quite scatter shot. The first act in particular feels a bit too quick cut, the second act isn't quite a tight as it could've been and the third act takes quite a sudden turn which I was prepared for but did feel a bit jarring. I did think reading the book that an adaption could lend itself better to a miniseries and having seen the film now I don't necessarily think I was wrong in that belief.I also think the characters as a whole are a bit of a mixed bag. I loved the central pair, Peter Dinklage's character and Viola Davis' deliciously over the top villain but most of the others were fairly one note. Josh Andrés Rivera's character was a high point from the book but I don't think he's that well realised here. I found him quite naive and not in an endearing way to the point where I didn't really care much when he was on screen. Most the students characters are just there to be classist caricatures without much depth and the tributes get some nice moments but it's obvious they're not the focus.It's definitely indulgent and scattershot but as a fan of the book and this series as a whole, I really enjoyed The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes as an adaptation. It's considerably darker than most YA adaptions, not to mention more graphic, and I could be more critical of certain aspects but as a fan I just couldn't help but enjoy the experience of this movie. I would comfortably put this as my 3rd favourite Hunger Games movie and if we don't get anymore this is without the best adaption of a YA movie series we've had since the Harry Potter franchise.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","BPRICE99","4 December 2023","This just wasn't it for me, maybe because I haven't really delved into the rest of the films - or I am not as emotionally attached to this series. I think it was a bit of swing and a miss.I thought it looked great, don't get me wrong this film looks and sounds great too - although I think this could be a borderline musical really but that's beside the point. Set design, costume, sound all of this was good and intriguing to the eye and fits perfectly into the series without any raised eyebrows.The story was somewhat ok and I think what knocked it for me was that it was very drawn out (I haven't read the book so it may be very faithful) but I thought that this could of been sped up somewhat. I found this film came into its own too late, and is mainly the reason why I found it long and perhaps a bit tedious.Action sequences where good, characters were certainly hit and miss, Violet Davis' is someone I would happily not see again.I feel this was a good attempt, but just missed the mark for me personally.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","BoydudeReviews","17 November 2023","I have never read the books before and it has been many years since I watched the movies. But I really enjoyed this film. Racheal Zeglar is awesome. I really enjoyed her performance. As well as the dude who played young snow. The movie feels like two movies but for some reason, it didn't feel bloated. It actually flowed really nicely. The third act was cery unexpected and took a very different tone in storytelling. I found it a little shocking if I am being honest. But I liked it alot. The first act 8s exactly what you think the film is going to be and the 2nd and 3rd act are pretty interesring with how different it is. But I enjoyed it. The one problem I had was that I would have liked more expansion into the plot points in thr third act. I could tell the screenwriters cut alot of that middle act out, even though I didn't reas the books. ButnI will give the film 8/10. Very good film. Must watch.😁","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","hieropice-05301","14 January 2024","I tried to watch this film. I was a fan of both the original series books and films. I haven't read the book this latest film was based on, and after watching the film (as much as I could stand), I likely won't bother.What the previous books and films did well (for the most part) was convince you a world where society was so broken that people would watch children slaughter each other on tv was possible. They built a universe with a history, characters, and circumstances that made sense, despite their extreme nature.But this film did none of that. We're introduced to characters, the protagonists, who immediately seem absurd. It was like they were trying to channel Harry Potter in a world that was never about magic, but instead about human evolution under extreme forces.One of the protagonists starts randomly singing while in Renaissance Faire cosplay within the first 20 minutes. People in the audience sing back-up. Why?! It was sentimental, saccharin and just silly. We don't even know these characters yet, but should buy that they're singing sending the protagonist off to die?I tried to continue watching, but none of the actors even seem to be in the same room as each other. Their interactions are unbelievable; Rachel clearly does not understand the tone of these stories and seems like she's been involuntarily transported from a Broadway stage. I didn't make it past the tv introductions of tribute and mentor scene, not even 30 minutes in. I can't stand terrible films, and this one just wasn't worth my time.","

The depiction of a future higher class society is was annoying and ridiculous.The main actors did well and that is the only reason we stay as long as we did, but the story line and everything else was just off the charts bad.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","tylerwfortenberry","20 November 2023","To start off with, if you didn't read the book, you likely won't like the movie, or so I've seen. That being said, I highly recommend picking up the book (yes it is in fact the longest one yet).TBSS was a long overdue return to Panem and was a story that was well received by the screen. Cinematically, the movie had some amazing shots and close ups that superseded its predecessors. This is in no doubt thanks to the almost ten years that have elapsed since the last installment in the franchise.As for chemistry, the tension between Blyth and Ziegler was alive and well and really took over during the evening visit to the zoo. Ziegler delivered nothing less than a stellar performance through every song, even though I initially thought there were one too many original songs in the book (sorry Collins). The soundtrack makes for a great transportation back to the movie after having seen it, though the downfall is that it does not stand alone like the previous soundtracks in the franchise did. Oh, how I wish Lorde had returned, or even Coldplay.In regard to its faithfulness to the book, the movie did a decent job of retaining the truth from its source material. The only major complaint I had was the extreme passage of time during the third part. At the same time, I argue the lengths at which Collins spent in that third part could have been cut shorter, so I understand the choice to skip over some sections. There was also a lack of development regarding Corio's and Sejanus' friendship. It felt very low stakes and was probably underdeveloped due to the lack of time spent in Part 3. I also have to argue that the last scene (you know the one I'm talking about) was a forced perspective of Snow's, so the audience can only help but think he's in the right, that is unless you've read the book and can understand his irrational paranoia. I also believe there was some essential dialogue cut that Casca Highbottom says at the end that explains Snow's motivations. Alas they got most of the book right, enough for me not to notice anything else.Overall, The Balls of Songbirds & Snakes delivered on almost every promise that the previous Hunger Games movie couldn't. We saw plenty of the Capitol. The director/writer did a wonderful job at humanizing the tributes, something the other movies failed at, which is very meta as they talk about trying to do so in the very book itself. The movie did well being split into three separate parts, once again nodding to the source material. Even without the internal dialogue offered by the book, Blyth's downward spiral into the president we came to know back in 2012 was honest and believable. I enjoyed the nods to previous books and movies and certainly enjoyed the cameo at the end. I am not one to see movies twice in the theaters, but this one might deserve a second go.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Anurag-Shetty","21 November 2023","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is based on the novel of the same name, by Suzanne Collins. It is set 64 years before the events of The Hunger Games(2012). Coriolanus Snow(Tom Blyth) mentors District 12 tribute, Lucy Gray Baird(Rachel Zegler). Soon, he develops feelings for her.The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a good film. However, The Hunger Games(2012), The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1(2014) & The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2(2015) surpass this prequel by a huge margin. Director Francis Lawrence can't recapture lightning in a bottle, directing his fourth movie in the Hunger Games franchise. The first half of the film is mind-blowing. However, it goes off the rails in the second half. The movie gets super dragging & goes on & on, with no end in sight. Another negative is, there are too many songs for a Hunger Games film. The action set pieces are fantastic & look even better in IMAX. The visual effects are flawless. Tom Blyth is impressive as Coriolanus Snow. Rachel Zegler is brilliant as Lucy Gray Baird. Hunter Schafer is perfect as Tigris Snow. Viola Davis is spectacular as Dr. Volumnia Gaul. Peter Dinklage is outstanding as Dean Casca Highbottom. Josh Andres Rivera is superb as Sejanus Plinth. The supporting cast is unforgettable. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is worth a watch if you're a fan of the Hunger Games movies & novels. However, watch it with low expectations & you just might enjoy yourself.","

""The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is a unique and recommended cinematic experience.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","JBLOSS","18 November 2023","I am not a huge fan of the Hunger Games franchise but have seen some of the other films. This effort felt overlong, I really can't see why they couldn't have told exactly the same story in 45 minutes less. There's too much filler and needless scenes that,if anything, should have been used to develop the characters more.The singing became a distraction and was overused, the violence was almost fetishised, with too much time and effort put into it at the expense of the relationships between the key characters. Plot twists and turns were never particularly explored or explained, and felt pretty arbitrary. I am guessing the book provides far greater depth than was achieved in this film.The lead actors never really achieved great chemistry and their relationship was, again pretty shallow to begin with,and wasn't given adequate time to grow and evolve.I can't say I hated the movie but I'd definitely not rush to watch it again, I doubt I'll remember much about it in a couple of weeks time.","

In addition, it set up the first The Hunger Games perfectly, something I felt the book was a little unclear on. I was worried that Lucy Gray's constant singing, as is in the book, would take over the film, but it was perfectly placed and necessary. All in all, a really entertaining watch for Hunger Games fans with some fantastic foreshadowing scenes and quotes that were far from cheesy. This felt like Suzanne Collins wrote the script, unlike in the Mockingjay Part 1 & 2 - a film definitely worth your time.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","nickryan-44535","17 November 2023","Stellar performances from everyone in this film. Tom Blyth really does a great performance as a young Snow and as the main character of this movie. I was not sure if I would be interested in a Snow origin story however the writers and Tom Blyth convinced me otherwise. While every actor holds their own it is no shock that Viola Davis is a standout as the evil doctor and might be my favorite performance of the entire movie.There is not much if anything I can critique about this film. Many having seemingly disliked Rachel Zegler's performance as the main female protagonist, but as someone who was not expecting much from this film I will say that she did very well. Not sure if they're expecting another Katniss but she is not that nor was she suppose to be. I will say that the biggest problem for me is the length of the film especially in the 3rd act. Various scenes could've been shortened particularly the singing scenes. It is definitely worth a watch in theaters it is a strong 7.5-8/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","healingtoolbox","18 November 2023","It's a savage, 1984 dystopian satire, on class inequality. Much of this comes from the unfamiliar and grand 1984 urban-scapes filmed in Poland and Germany.From another angle, it plays more like like a horror film; you wait for each young kid to be killed to find out how. It's dark, not a young adult action flick like the original Hunger Games trilogy or the first Mazerunner movie. Would have done better at box-office released in October for Halloween?Best acting is by an unrecognizable Viola Davis (The Woman King). She's a mad scientist supper-villain--yet, not over-done. If Donald Sutherland was 10/10 crazy, she takes ""unhinged"" to 11. Impressive. She commits to showing the ugliest and unpleasant aspect of dissociated economic elites.Using title cards, the movie is divided into three acts. The end of the second act is the highpoint of the film. DON'T MISS IT! Brilliant and amazing filmmaking! Afterwards, I was half ready for the credits to roll. Yet it goes on for another 45 minutes to show us how young Snow became old Snow in the trilogy.The King's Man (2021) had a similar problem. The film peaked at the end of the first act. For Hollywood blockbusters, both The King's Man and this film are original and narratively unorthodox. I believe the average male movie ticket buyer often perceives ""original"" movies as ""problematic."" The Creator (2023) also had originality audiences did not appreciate.Joss Whedon's scripting maxim still applies, to be big hits, a movie has to announce its genre to audiences; and then, ""stay within its lane,"" be creative with the tropes available to work with. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023) took Joss's advice to good effect.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","willphelan","18 November 2023","I never thought I needed another Hunger Games movie, especially a prequel without Jennifer Lawrence. However this movie was incredible and I feel like it added a lot to the franchise. Suzanne Collins added so much interesting depth and background for President Snow here and the script did a great job adapting her story. Collins doesn't get enough credit for how insightful and impactful her work really is. This movie is a slow burn where we see Snow fall into darkness and I love how subtle the character work is. He doesn't feel like he just snaps, it feels like a progression of his character as he interprets a new meaning of what the Hunger Games mean. Tom Blyth was phenomenal as a young Coriolanus Snow. He had so much range and we were able to understand how this villain we hate in the original movies was formed. His relationship with Lucy Gray was perfectly done. Say what you want about Rachel Zegler but she can ACT. She captured Lucy Gray so well and I love the incorporation of the musical performances. I thought it was really cool how we learn that Lucy values trust over love and the moment she feels she can't trust Snow, she turns on him. The impact this has on Snow is his final breaking point and I love how this scene is handled. The way she leaves him by singing the Hanging Tree is brilliant and adds so many layers to Snow's character in the original films. The entire supporting cast is also good, with Viola Davis being the standout. The action scenes are intense for the most part although I don't feel like the arena scenes were as good as the original movies. The film has excellent atmosphere building and the set design and costumes are top tier just like they always are in the Hunger Games franchise. Francis Lawrence once again did a great job directing. There were lots of great scenes and shots throughout. A highlight for me was the scene where Lucy is singing into the camera in the arena as the snakes sliver around her body. I thought the movie had some pacing issues but nothing that was really that big of a deal. Overall this was a prequel that is worthy of the originals while also telling its own great story. 8/10.","

Katniss might have had a whistle, but this girl gets to sing her little hillbilly heart out.3 unnecessary stories rolled into one dreadfully long movie filled with characters we never connect with. TBH the only one i cared about was Wovey and they did her dirty. They took that too far.3 hours of CGI and gratuitous solos by the obviously talented lead, but other than that her acting falls very very short.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Pjtaylor-96-138044","25 November 2023","I missed the start of this because for some reason the cinema didn't play any trailers, so I felt like I was playing catch up with the characters and their dynamics for a little while (I came in on the scene in which the mentors are told whom they're going to be mentoring, so I can't have missed that much). When the film was over, I worked out I must have only missed seven minutes, so I guess that most of the audience was playing catch up along with me (that can't be Lucy Gray's literal introduction, can it?). Basically what I'm saying is that a lot of the context I assumed I missed because I was late is actually just missing from the piece full stop, and it's something that plagues the entirety of the picture. Where 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014)' and 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)' ought to have been split into a single movie with a runtime not dissimilar from that of this film, 'The Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes (2023)' (that's one too many ""The""s, by the way) really ought to have been split into two separate movies with runtimes similar to those films. So much of this is far too rushed for its own good, and - although the flick hits the ground running and leaves little room for boredom, at least initially - this is ultimately the main flaw of the feature. There are plenty of genuinely interesting ideas at play here, with the picture following a character who comes to realise that his own self-interest might just take precedent over helping other people (or generally doing the right thing) when circumstances force him to choose between the two. Its grey morality is fairly refreshing, and having someone who isn't a hero be the protagonist of a wide-appeal blockbuster - particularly one based on young adult fiction - is quite ballsy. The problem is that none of its ideas get the time they need to feel fully formed. There's very little granularity to the character arcs and the most important relationships never feel genuine because they aren't really given all that much attention. There are solid scenes that focus on character work, but they're almost like milestones that the flick unceremoniously sprints past and are much harder to appreciate because of it. The film is at its best during the eponymous Hunger Games, as its distinct mentor-tribute relationship and Capitol-based perspective set it apart from the other films in its series. There's a lot of tension and suspense during this second act, and it generally keeps you on the edge of your seat. The pacy first part also features some compelling, if all too brief, set-up for this segment, establishing a more rudimentary rule set for the barbaric situation and having the lead make headway in transforming it into the entertainment-as-punishment we recognise from the other films in the franchise. It's all rather entertaining, even if it does leave you feeling a bit breathless. After the games, though, the feature slams on the brakes and slows to a crawl. The pacing almost entirely resets, and what follows is both too long to be an epilogue and too short to be its own thing. Again, it introduces some thoroughly intriguing ideas and it does have some really engaging moments, but it just doesn't have time to do anything with its ideas and ultimately ends with a bit of a whimper. That's not to say the ending is especially bad, but it does leave you thinking ""that's it?"" (despite the fact that it's technically quite well-rounded). The tragedy of the plot doesn't really come through as well as it ought to, and the ending doesn't have the intimacy in character behind it to justify its comparatively tiny scope. The formal successes of every technical department go under the radar, too, because of the underwhelming way in which the narrative is faithfully yet insufficiently adapted from the source material (which I haven't read). The writing really is the only thing holding this back, as it's a well-made effort with solid performances and some really entertaining sequences. It is enjoyable and some of it is surprisingly intellectually stimulating, but it could have been so much better with just a few small yet significant tweaks.P. S. It's kind of weird how it's essentially a musical, but I don't mind that.","

I thought it was a decent (though bland) movie but it did feel like a long movie to me at times. I wondered when it was going to end which to me rarely is a good sign.The movie is made up of three acts if I remember correctly. I get the idea and it's not neccessarily bad but to me it felt like they were trying to smush together a bit too much in one movie. Since they have three acts to go through they can't get too detailed in each act. I felt like the hunger games for example were too quick and they didn't really put enough energy into it. It felt a bit vapid to me to be quite honest. The other acts also could be more detailed to get an even bigger feel for the characters.I would have prefered if the last act was it's own movie since it in a lot of moments felt rushed. I would have liked to see more character developement since the characters to me just over night became vastly different. To have a movie that picks up after the games and followed Snow's, Lucy Grey's and the other characters dealing with what happened would to me be better. That way you can properly explore the events and people.All in all the movie was decent but a bit bland to me. I didn't neccessarily dislike it. I have to say the actors did a great job though.","

The war still lays fresh in the minds of Capital citizen as the rebuild begins, yet the spirit of rebellion still lives in the Districts. Nobody has a full grasp on how to handle the controversial Hunger Games, or even if it will continue, yet the show goes on. IThen comes a young Coriolanus Snow, who revolutionizes the way the Games are approached while mentoring a young girl from District 12, Lucy Gray Baird. Here, the sadistic and narcissist mindset of the President Snow we love to hate is born. His keen insight and manipulative attitude develops into a killing spree born of a deep hunger for power.Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage are brilliant as usual. Not impressed with Rachel Zegler as lead actress (she is no Jennifer Lawrence after all), but Tom Blyth as Snow heads the cast well and encapsulates the persona of President Snow subtly as the film continues.Like I said, any novice Hunger Games fan can enjoy the fascinating and intriguing parallels between this film and the iconic trilogy. While it can never be compared to its successor, ""The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes"" brings justice to the Suzzane Collins' world.Yes, it's drawn out a bit in the middle... get over it.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","jpachar82","18 November 2023","How do you create a tyrant? Well let's see, you begin by dismantling him and bring him up in a nation and a world full of venomous snakes (so to speak), and then you take that man, and you begin to unravel him. Nothing says blood and more blood than the fact that you cannot get it out, it leaves a nasty scar, and it stains too, not just on clothes, but your cold, cold heart.There is no wander Suzanne Collins wanted to revisit Panem, she wanted to tell the story of how one kid became a ruthless dictator and the why and how behind it. Now I refuse to sit here and tell the story, no I will let you be the judge and character of that. This prequel will not only be the greatest in this series, but I will say Francis Lawrence has done it yet again.Nothing screams blockbuster, then this one. This move has defied all odds or as the tagline for the series says, ""may the odds be ever in your favor."" The odds are that you will not survive the arena. The entire cast was just phenomenal and the storyline leading up to the first movie left a lot of holes filled in. This cast including the talented and most gorgeous one of all.... Ms. Viola Davis, she can be sinister and yes, I have seen it, but not this sinister. To the newcomer Tom Blyth, congratulations dude, you just made Donald Sutherland very proud.To the beautiful Rachel Zegler, I said this for West Side Story, and I will say it again, seductively incredible - I cannot begin to tell you how incredible you were. To the rest of the cast Peter Dinklage, Hunter Schaefer - awesome.Thank you, Suzanne, for bringing us back to Panem, we have lost it over the last 9 years since Mockingjay, Part 2 - thank you, thank you.This movie was in a word sinister and wonderful rise to the threat of Panem through the eyes of Coriolanus Snow.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","therealnerdypickle","17 February 2024","I LOVED this book, but if you didn't read it you would have NO idea what was going on. Even if you did, there's so many important details left out, this movie really should've been split into two. I was excited to watch this movie, but it was a HUGE let down. It has so many cuts and it feels very rushed unlike the amazing book it's based off of. It left out way too much and it felt like the spirit of the book was just excorsised out of this movie. Why? If you made 2 you'd be making more money anyway! You would give the plotline and world building more time, and make this feel way less rushed. And CLEMENSIA WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN AFTER THE STINKING SNAKE BITE!!! SHES VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN THE BOOK! AND SEJANUS' MOTHER? SHES ALSO VERY IMPORTANT! Anyways, to wrap up I do have to say that last scene where they run off (which was not like the book did it, I should've directed this movie) Lucy Gray is given a big awareness moment of ""Oh yeah maybe my big capital brainwashed boyfriend might murder me to get what he wants"" Props to Rachel Zegler for that, she got the suspicion in Lucy's character in that scene done well.","

I would watch it again and again. It's up there with Catching Fire honestly.Don't let bums on the internet convince you that this movie is mid or that anything about it isn't worth your time.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","maleon-68612","2 January 2024","It wasn't bad, but not half as good as the novel. Many things are left out, other things are portrayed differently. Considering that adapting such a complex story is really difficult, I think they did quite a good job. Pacing was too fast obviously, which isn't surprising, a running time of 158 minutes just isn't enough to cover the 500+ pages the right way. I really liked Peter Dinklage as Highbottom, he did a brilliant job imo. The portrayal of Snow and Lucy Gray's love story seemed rush and unfitting.Yes, Rachel Zegler might not be the most likeable person, but I think it's stupid to review this movie based solely on how much you dislike Zegler. I highly recommend everyone to read the novel, doesn't matter if you enjoyed the movie or not.","

The movie stars of slow, getting to now the timeline we are in and the characters and than the plot starts picking up speed and we are in the Hunger Games again. I was a bit hesitant about this being a prequel of the original franshise movies but this absolutely did not disappoint. I hope this could be a start of a new streak of movies in the Hunger Games franshise.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","TaylorYee94","23 December 2023","That's the whole point of this prequel, Snow's transition to embodiment of Lawful Evil, isn't it? 'The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes' should have been a series rather than a 150-minute movie. Francis Lawrence has so many things to tell and maintains the pace of the story, but at the last minute starting from 'Part 3: The Peacekeeper', he crams all those and develops so hastily that I am short of breath just by watching. What's with all the sudden change of emotions from all characters and rushed progress of plot? It loses all coherence and logic along the way.Ironically, this film makes me realize that Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Donald Sutherland trio is the best you can ask for. Lawrence and Hutcherson were about the same age and had similar duration of acting experience as Zegler and Blyth when they started the first movie of the Hunger Games franchise. They were brilliant and passionate afresh. Zegler's performance is especially disappointing.However, just like any other Hunger Games, the film offers exciting and spirited adventure, drama, and energy. The plot development for Part 1 & 2 is not bad.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","connor707","19 November 2023","As a fan of all four books, I felt that the original trilogy missed the mark at many moments and overall could not deliver all of the things that truly made the books great.This movie however, succeeded.Although much of the movie is condensed due to time constraints, I felt that this adaptation still preserved every important beat of the story and the tone of almost every scene. At the TBOSAS core, it is a story about Coriolanus' view of humanity and him ultimately coming to the conclusion, as is the point of the games, that humans are inherently evil and the world is cruel. In a cruel world with malevolent beings filling it, why not be the man in charge? Why not be cruel right back to the world and kill and starve others? This story shows Coriolanus get to this state of mind, however misguided his cognitive journey may be. It is the story of a man losing any semblance of morals he had and losing his own humanity in order to become the powerful villain of the main trilogy. 100% worth the watch (even if you did not read the book).","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","20 November 2023","64 years prior to the original we see what Panem was like in the early days of its fascist rule a mere 10 years after the civil war ended.Lucy Gray is a friendly, sweet travelling performer... with a distinct edge beneath. Rachel Zegler's singing and acting are excellent, though do take a few minutes to get used to, and certainly I get why some say that there are too many musical interludes here. I acknowledge that some of the things she's said show that she's not the best feminist yet - let's please keep in mind, she's 22 years old. I would definitely say she's well on her way. Give her some time to have more life experience and reflect on these things more, and I'm sure she'll get there.It has been 8 years since we last got an entry in this film series. Some would say that the moment has passed. And that this does not have enough new material to justify making it. That it smacks of corporate greed. In my opinion, this was the exact perfect time to make another one. Allow me to explain why.This is the first of these to be made after the PG-13 rating was pushed so far that it could properly allow for coming extremely close to showing the bloody violence that the subject matter requires. While this is not as intense as certain parts of the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, it is very obvious that it came out after that one, rather than shortly after the first one. The action and tension are the most visceral yet, and each death hits you like a sledgehammer. They're also the most clear and well-staged, easy to follow with one very effective long take.Some of the central issues that this franchise provides social commentary on have become worse and/or visible to a general audience. Regular people are forced to work ridiculously hard for less than a living wage, while the rich live a sheltered existence - it's very telling that several major characters in this feel no fear of actual danger, but instead consider their potential embarrassment to be a fate far worse than the certain death of 23 teenagers that had no way to avoid becoming Tributes.The youngest generations find themselves in a world where they have to be constantly camera ready, and the gig economy provides what little they have to live on. They either grow up too quickly or seemingly not at all, while their elders, those with significant power, who have created the current terrible conditions, judge them harshly, sitting in their ivory towers, insisting that it couldn't be any other way. 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow is influenced by several people in his life who try to encourage him to go in specific directions, and the potential for the future that he and his peers at least hypothetically hold is underlined; to either create a better society, or destroy all hope of it for generations to come - to let nationalists completely eliminate civil rights of anyone they deem lesser, or to wrestle back control.Those reporting on deadly conflicts may not actually care, or feel they have any skin in the game, and might treat it with little sensitivity, provide no context and simply try to get great ratings. There was never a long period of this movie that did not make me reflect on incredibly sad recent news stories. I understand that this is a negative for many, and I 100% respect those who disagree with the following; I don't go to movies to turn off my brain and be completely distracted from tough reality. I go for something that will help me process it better. And this absolutely delivered that.I recommend this to anyone who believes they can handle it - you'll know a few minutes in. 8/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","jp_91","27 November 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a good film that, as a prequel, managed to interest me in its story without having first seen the other films or read the ""The Hunger Games"" novels. The production is of a spectacular level, the script divided into three acts is effective, the first is dramatic and manages to generate sympathy with the main characters, the second act has good action scenes and manages to have good tension that makes you worry about the characters, but the third and last act is weak, slow but has well-directed dramatic moments. The performances are good, highlighting Rachel Zegler who also shows off her voice in several songs, and Viola Davis brings to life a unique character. The cinematography is not excellent but it does its job. The music composed for the film is its greatest success, highlighting the dramatic, action and suspense scenes. A film that manages to be good, but could have gone further with a better structured script in its final act.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","neil-476","1 December 2023","In the early days of the Hunger Games, poorly-off Panem Capital aristo Coriolanus Snow becomes mentor to District 12 tribute Lucy Grey Baird. In the course of trying new ideas, such as getting the audience to like Lucy (she's a good singer), he falls for her and determines to make sure she survives.I quite enjoyed the books and the previous films so I was up for a prequel (I haven't read the prequel novel). And it's not bad. The war is much more recent, which shows everywhere - even the capital is somewhat down-at-heel. Everything is considerably lower tech, and the film portrays a believable earlier era to what we have previously seen.The cast are fine, with Peter Dinklage's final scene showing what a great actor he is, and Viola Davies delivering a character even more cold-blooded and scary than Amanda Waller.And the story is involving and often goes in unexpected directions. At 150+ minutes, my attention never wandered.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","beckstacyeliza","19 November 2023","This movie could have stood to be thirty minutes to an hour shorter. Two and half hours is plenty of time to develop a little backstory on more characters than just Snow. In the original films, I feel like they were able to help people get to know and understand a lot of the main characters. In this prequel, the only people we really come to understand are Snow, Tigress, and Plinth. I wish they would have showed more of the past of Lucy, the original game maker, and even some of the other hunger games tributes. Even the game maker with all her creatures-I wish they would have given even a line as to why she's into that stuff and how she got into it.As for the singing, I found it all very annoying and cringey. Most of the songs actually have a positive tone, which is strange for such a dark story. Lucy also chooses to sing at times that are really weird and don't make sense. She's also exaggerated-her southern accent, her personality, her facial expressions, everything. It's like I'm watching a musical rather than a serious movie. It's also like if you go to Disney and see performers put on a show and do a musical number for guests-it's that over the top. Also, I wish Lucy just used a flat, America/midwest kind of accent-that would have made it 100% better.Lastly, without giving spoilers, Snow makes some decisions that impact his trajectory and I wish they would have had some more lead up to those decisions. Like there isn't enough character development to get him there on some of those early decisions. I think things all end up making sense in the end, but it was a tough journey for the audience keeping with the story to get there. I know some reviews say the movie is true to the books and even some people behind me said ""that was so good!"" So maybe I just don't like the story. You'll have to decide for yourself.","

I know its a hype to hate stuff without decent reasons for the last few years but its getting ridiculous even with great movies.This movie does a perfect job of showing us how, Snow became the hatefull man we know him as i even sympathize with him a little bit .It also shows us how the capitol got tricked in liking the anual hunger games and making it more of a show then just killing.On top of that there are alot of easter eggs/ refferences to the movies we already have , so watch the movie and dont listen to the BS negative reviews.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","alyssafrantz","20 November 2023","I never read the book but I heard the movie adaptation is very close. If that's the case, the book must be incredibly boring. I'll admit the cinematography was great and it looked good. But the acting of a lot of the characters was not great, the purpose of the sister and grandma was 1000% missing - they might've well not been in the story at all, and after the actual games, you'd think Lucy Gray would be traumatized and have a hard time going back to her life. Nope! Not at all. This film was basically two films - the half before the games at the capital, and the half after they got to District 12. There was no connection in the two halves. BUT THE MOST ANNOYING PART: the main character NEVER PICKED A SIDE. It was impossible to pick apart his M. O., he got upset over things he caused and knew would happen (""uh oh, if it isn't the consequences to my own actions""), any character change happened offscreen, and he gave us no reason to root for him. I would've loved to see a slow burn to the crazed, evil Snow that we know from the trilogy. But there was no inciting incident that caused that. Also, Lucy Gray's actress has a beautiful voice, but there was too much singing in the movie, it was awkward, and didn't seem realistic at all.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","mieriks","1 January 2024","This movie, about Coriolanus Snow who mentors and develops feelings for the female District 12 tribute during the 10th Hunger Games, is a great prequel to The Hunger Games (2012)!There's not a lot that needs to be said because there's only a few flaws, I think. One thing that I think is both a drawback and a great achievement at the same time is the character development, which is basically the main plot of the movie. I honestly think the series' original antagonist's psychological development from being ""good"" to ""bad"" may feel a bit too short for a single movie to be, but at the same time it's well executed for the 2 hours and 37 minutes it's been given. It can feel slightly rushed in therms of the big picture, but the scenes themselves that focus on Coriolanus' development is captivating, I think.Otherwise, I think the script is well written, the characters are interesting, Tom Blyth (as Coriolanus Snow) is the perfect cast for the protagonist, Coriolanus, most of the other actors also give good performances with especially Rachel Zegler's (as Lucy Gray Baird) beautiful voice, the cinematography is fantastic despite that I usually don't like wide angles, the scenery and costumes are gorgeous, and of course the score is beautiful as always. So overall, the movie is a worthy installment of The Hunger Games Pentalogy (2012-2023)!This is a captivating prequel that effectively delves into the origins of President Snow, despite the slightly rushed character development. The movie's strong script, compelling characters, and stunning visuals make it a worthy addition to The Hunger Games Pentalogy.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","akoaytao1234","20 November 2023","Ballad of Songbirds preludes the original series, mostly focusing on hw Snow came to be. Its the tenth Hunger Games, and people had enough of the games. No one is watching AND a group of elite students are forced to join forces with the Hunger Games participants to get a coveted scholarship AND make changes to improve the games. A young Snow meets a young district 12 tribute and develop a relationship which would force them to reckon what each other truly loves first.There somethings special about this film that works wonderfully.In the world of quick Marvel thrill, this slow burn epic character study has lost its way in the screen. There is stakes there is real difference in agenda AND I like that. I think the original series has this grand scheme that does work well since its message is clear BUT this film feels much more pointed. The violence here feels wretched compared to the original. It is inherently darker and hopeless. The lack of technology makes things much less surreal than the original.Snow here, is almost similar to what he'll be in the future BUT he still has this sort of finding his footing. His pragmatic and knows his limitation. He is priviledged enough to study in a prestigious school but is not rich enough to really go for broke with his ideas. He is still beneath most of them. When given a chance to find a way to get a scholarship he clearly needs, he step forward AND find himself too entangled. He develops a selffish love for someone who truly wants to live and win BUT whose heart lays close to her home.I know there is a clear criticism that can be laid on some parts of the film. The third act does swerve pace wise, and feels almost like a seperate story that felt too rushed. While I do not consider it as bad per se, but I feel that there are ways to continue the stakes of the first 2/3 of the film AND improve the overall . The singing too can be bothersome and does feel Glee TV-like.Otherwise, big kudos to Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler. They really made the film. The film is not perfect but they are able to perfectly encapsulate the moods the shifts of the film. Its definitely not cookie cutter stuff. Though, Josh Andres Rivera was not fit to do the heavy lifting to show the needed conflict in the latter part of the film. I LOVE ZANY VIOLA DAVIS and JASON SCHWARTZMANN. I like when they camps it up but not so much.Highly recommended. Probably one of the better big budget films in the longest while. BUT I do feel this needs a BASIC knowledge of the Hunger Games Series.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","katherinelangen-26180","20 November 2023","I think it stayed as true to the book as the length of the movie would allow. There had to be a lot of adapting to fit 500+ pages in a 2.5 hour movie.That being said, I don't think they did a great job of conveying Snow's internal struggle. Love vs His Future. Human Decency vs Power. His Past vs His Present. He was CONSTANTLY torn in the book.Throughout the book, you wondered how he would eventually turn ""bad"". His journey and eventual decision makes sense and doesn't seem quick and sudden. There doesn't seem to be an obvious character arc in the movie that shows his change.At the end of the movie, Snow's ""betrayal"" and reaction towards Lucy may seem confusing and rushed if you don't have background from reading the book. You don't really know how much Lucy means to him and how shocking that ending should be.It's a good adaptation, but it's definitely not the best Hunger Games movie!","

It feels like a logical continuation of the narrative. Her message is more about identifying how institutions use entertainment to divert attention from and control the masses than it is about opposing fascism. Collins does, however, allow a soulful folk singer-the title's figurative songbird-to act as the voice of resistance even inside that critique.Rachel Zegler, the star of ""West Side Story,"" pays grudging homage to Lucy Gray Baird. She is a hybrid of Jennifer Lawrence's selfless hero Katniss Everdeen from the original films, Victor Hugo's enthralling Gypsy Esmeralda, and a pop icon like Taylor Swift who unites people. Her songs are the high point of a gloomy thriller that is overly drawn out by thirty minutes and becomes incredibly confusing towards the end. However, Hollywood has long since concluded that people enjoy their blockbusters obese, and ""Ballad"" is just the most recent example of over-delivering.There's just one character in ""Ballad"" that viewers will recognize immediately: Coriolanus Snow, the future dictator (played by Donald Sutherland), who is now an underdog cadet.

This particular story, and especially McAvoy's performance, would have been compelling enough without Shyamalan's characteristic inability to understand when he's ruining his own premise.Grade: B","

"Split","arniecage","2 July 2018","A fantastic performance by the film's star, James McAvoy is reason alone to watch this film. Every personality on display is distinct to the other, and he is so interesting to watch. Anya who was breath-taking in The Witch does a fine job here too. This is a film where M. Night Shyamalan reasserts himself as a serious director following a string of poor films. I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel and the conclusion of the Unbreakable series arriving in January. 8.5/10.","

The premise of the film seems quite superficial at first but as the layers are peeled back there's so much more beneath.It's a horror film without special effects gore, an action flick without any car chases. A high-tension psychological thriller for viewers with active imaginations, who don't need to be spoon-fed every explanation.The acting is top-notch, the script sympathetic, the cinematography and set fantastic, and the music/sound subtle enough not to be noticed, consciously, while building the tension inexorably. It's gripping, un-turn-away-able.Seriously impressive. I don't give 10's lightly.","

"Split","TheMovieDiorama","27 February 2018","Ahhhhhh I am so disappointed with this! I really wanted to love it, it ticks all the right boxes for a decent thriller. Yet somehow Shyamalan missed the mark. It's not bad, in fact it's crafted intricately...just not great. A man with 23 different personalities abducts three young girls as he prepares to unleash the 24th personality that dominates the others. This is extremely difficult to review. For every positive outcome there is a negative to counteract it. For example: Kevin's internal survival against the other personalities was an intriguing and compelling concept. However, the enthralling psychological analysis was negated by the stupidity of this whole 24th personality that is able to physically change Kevin. A thought provoking theme is decimated by an unrealistic concept in an attempt to be dramatic. It didn't need to be! The first act was going so well with interesting ideas that Shyamalan clearly has an interest in. His focus on this multiple personality disorder shows in the film. Patient and psychologist conversations take place that explains Kevin's fractured mind. Then it constantly shifts to the thriller aspect where these three young girls are trying to escape from a sinister location. It's not exciting. At all. These girls aren't put in any real danger or hardly attempt to flee so what's the point? They just exist for the finale which as a result makes the film absurdly boring. These girls are lifeless. Except Taylor-Joy's character who actually has some decent backstory, told through flashbacks. Split is a tool for James McAvoy to showcase multiple fantastic performances. Genuinely creepy and unnerving. His ability to automatically switch characters was faultless and found him to be highly enjoyable. Also like the final scene which harks back to a certain film which I shall not name. I look forward to future prospects. But in the end, Split was a failed attempt at a thriller but an intriguing psychological drama. It's unfortunate the two just didn't blend for me.","

"Split","crberme","22 October 2017","I was surprised to see that this movie was released last year (as I'm writing this) and I didn't heard about it, taking in consideration how promising the plot is.Split is about three girls get kidnapped by a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID) that has 23 personalities. I have to say that this movie does not represent what DID really is and how people who struggle with it are, mainly because this movie gets a bit too fantastical sometimes. It doesn't try to be strictly realistic though, so it's an awesome thriller anyway.The movie gives you chills since the very start with an awesome acting by James McAvoy and some seriously good still scenes. The overall scenes make you have a weird feeling, something it succeeds to transfer to the viewer that you probably won't be able to describe. That makes this thriller stand out in a good way.Maybe Split makes a unrealistic representation of dissociative identity disorder, and that can be a big turnoff, but this is a great movie nonetheless.","

I can say unequivocally that this is the best thing I have watched in a long time time.The first thing I think this film will be remembered for is the stellar performance of lead actor James Mcavoy, a wonderfully charismatic and talented actor, I'm sure most of us adore, I feel here he's announced himself as a serious contender for mega roles. His ability to switch from one persona to another, to be dark, sinister, camp, soft, cute etc. is incredible, people sat around me watching the movie were stunned at how good he was. The Dennis, Hedwig and Patricia characters in particular show his total versatility.A brilliant supporting cast, Betty Buckley did a fantastic job as Kevin's doctor, as did the trio of girls, Anya Taylor-Joy I thought was especially good.I make it sound like he's the only reason to see the film, far from it, the opening is gripping, the story itself so chilling, and the ending a real surprise.I implore you, see this in the cinema.","

"Split","grantss","13 November 2017","A man kidnaps three teenage girls and holds them prisoner in a basement. He has multiple personality disorder, and is the prize patient of Dr Karen Fletcher, who is using him as case study in the condition. Several of his 23 personalities make their appearance to the girls. While none of them seem particularly harmful, there are indications that there lurks inside of him an ultra-strong and violent personality, The Beast.Written and directed by M Night Shyamalan, I was hoping this would be a return to something like the form of his earlier films. Yes, it would be difficult to match the brilliance of The Sixth Sense but something approaching great would be a good start. Unfortunately his trajectory over the last 11 years or so has been decidedly downwards with some monumentally bad movies - The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender (plus, probably, After Earth - I haven't seen it but apparently it is incredibly bad).So I was quite disappointed when I actually watched this, especially in the first half of the movie. Script, by Shyamalan, is weak, and padded. There was heaps of potential in the concept and themes but this is not used effectively.The biggest problem is that the initial plot is contrived and implausible. It hinges on you believing that the three girls would allow themselves to be held captive. They have plenty of opportunities to overwhelm the captor, but don't, and even when they actually figure on doing that we have a very weak and contrived reason for them not doing it.Plus there is a lot of padding to the movie. While the captor's visits to Dr Fletcher do add some depth to his character(s) and to her side of the story, much of it is unnecessary.So for the first half (even more) I was mostly sitting there thinking ""This is so unrealistic, just escape already!"" and getting bored at some of the discussions.It gets more intriguing and exciting in the second half, and starts to make more effective use of the multiple personality device, but that doesn't make up for the poor start.Can't fault the performances though. James McAvoy is great as the captor, having to essentially play about nine roles, and have to switch between them in a heartbeat. Anya Taylor-Joy is solid as Casey, with good support from Betty Buckley, as Dr Fletcher, and Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula as the other two kidnapped girls.On the whole, not great, and certainly not in the same league as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable or even The Village, but better than most of the stuff M Night Shyamalan has dished up over the last 11 years. A step in the right direction, at least.","

"Split","LloydBayer","6 February 2017","What a terrific comeback for Shyamalan! Many have been vocal that horror writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has been on a downward spiral after having peaked with Unbreakable, his very own superhero origins film. Split sees the continuation of Shyamalan's tryst with the supernatural but also a long awaited rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to resurface. While his last film - The Visit - was predictable but entertaining, Split underscores his storytelling prowess with the high level of creativity that made him a household name in contemporary horror.Yet fans will concur that Split isn't just a comeback either, rather a tactical setup of Shyamalan's very own cinematic universe. Put literally, the film is about a person with multiple personalities where each personality speaks collectively in full awareness of the rest. Although main character Kevin is said to exhibit 23 personalities, we see just a handful during most of the film. There's Barry, a New York fashionista, Hedwig, a goofy 9-year-old, and darker personalities Patricia and Dennis. Calling themselves The Horde, the latter two have influenced the abduction of three high school girls as a ritualistic sacrifice for the 24th personality often referred to as ""The Beast"". The girls have limited time before The Beast is unleashed and although paralysed by fear, their escape depends on protagonist Casey's (Anya Taylor-Joy) proactive deconstruct of the good and evil personalities that reside in Kevin. To her advantage and through revelatory flashbacks, we learn that this wouldn't be the first time Casey would confront a monster.If Edward Norton's dual personalities was chilling in his debut film Primal Fear, wait till you get a load of James McAvoy in what is simply an outstanding performance of versatility (or should I say two dozen performances in one film?). More than just a demanding role to pull off, McAvoy's broad range in this film has also elevated what could have been a familiar antagonist into a nerve wrecking supervillain. Which is why Shyamalan's so called signature twist ending is almost astounding. To be honest there isn't an actual twist in the story, but the ending is an unexpected but seamless integration into a sort of trilogy that will have most viewers gob smacked. It's an inside joke and almost as if Shyamalan is asking if we have you been watching closely, but also an extremely rewarding Easter egg for every true fan of the man. Welcome back Mr. Shyamalan!","

"Split","kirbylee70-599-526179","11 June 2017","There are some director's whose name alone brings forth images of the films they have made. If you hear Hitchcock you know a slow paced thriller is on the way. Spielberg? Normally a family styled big budget adventure. And when you hear M. Night Shyamalan you expect something different. Not always the same but unlike most movies you will see. That holds true with his latest release SPLIT.As the film opens three young girls are kidnapped with no clue who is behind it or where they've been taken. Rather than a simple hostage movie we're seeing something different. The girls find their kidnapper to be stern and unwilling to give into their pleas for help. But then they see him again. Except that it's not quite him.This is when we learn that the kidnapper, Kevin (James McAvoy) is suffering from dissociative identity disorder or what most people would call multiple personalities. When he shows up to the rooms they're being held in wearing a dress and telling them his name is Patricia the girls have no idea what to think. Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), the outsider of the trio, insists that they bide their time to figure a way out. The other two girls are more impulsive and act without thinking things through.When they meet ""Hedwig"" Casey thinks she may have found someone who can help her. She spends time gaining his trust and learning more about what is going on. He tells her about ""The Beast"" and warns that he is coming. When she later asks the ""others"" about ""The Beast"" she is rebuffed but learns just a little more with each conversation.Do the girls escape as the film moves forward? I'd rather not say and allow the story to surprise and unravel for each of you. But the movie does move on with more information gathered in various ways. One of those is the discussions between Kevin and his psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Fletcher has been treating Kevin for some time now and is becoming slightly alarmed via various signs that something has changed.Fletcher doesn't just spend time with Kevin though. While he insist that he is in control she convinces him to allow some of the ""others"" to talk to her. At different visits the multiple people within Kevin's mind are allowed to talk to her and discuss things with her. Each of them provides her with a greater sense of dread that something is happening.Back at the house where the girls are being kept, Casey continues to work her way into the good graces of Hedwig. As the bond between the two of them builds the slightest glimpse of hope appears that perhaps the girls will make it out after all. With no demands made to their parents just why they were kidnapped to begin with comes into question. And when the answer presents itself the level of tension and fear reaches fever pitch. Is there really a ""Beast"" or is that just something in the mind of Kevin.For me Shyamalan has been a hit and miss director. While I've never hated any of his films there have been a few that I felt had fallen a little short of the potential he showed in others. With SPLIT he returns to my good graces with a movie that draws you in, takes it's time to unfold and tells a story unlike any other. In a world of remakes that earns points with me. He definitely gives us something new here.The acting is amazing to watch here. While the entire cast does a fantastic job it is McAvoy who takes center stage and steals the show. It's one thing for an actor to portray a character in a movie. But to create several and have them all well thought out and well done characters? That's something worth paying attention to. The only problem would be trying to figure out which character would be the one receiving an Oscar nomination if it came to that.I noted remakes but what about sequels you might ask. SPOILER ALERT. This film is indeed a sequel but not so much that you would recognize it as such. We've never been exposed to these characters, never seen this world as far as we know and have no inkling that it ties into anything else. That is until the film is just about to hit the credits. At that time we see people talking in a diner and the camera pans down to reveal Bruce Willis sitting there listening to a conversation where someone is trying to recall the name of a terrorist who was in a wheelchair. He tells them the name was Mr. Glass. The name and his presence is a reference to Shyamalan's film UNBREAKABLE. And yes, this film ties into that. As will his next film, one he announced will complete a trilogy bringing all three films together. As a fan of that film I can't wait.Until then I'll be content to watch this movie. And probably more than once. It's one of those films that once you know the end you want to watch again to see what else you can pick up as the story unwinds. That makes it a movie worth not just watching but adding to the collection.","

I remember being 13 years old, sitting on my couch a few nights before halloween. I wanted to watch a horror film, so I browsed on the ""Free Movies"" section on Xfinity Demand. I scrolled down the page, and my eyes everted to Split. I read the plot synopsis, and I really liked the concept and watching the film for the first time was one of the best movie watching experiences I've ever had. I was glued to my seat the whole time watching the film and it genuinely scared me. I noticed how the movie builds suspense and I also paid attention to the interesting camera angles the cinematographer chose to shot. After watching the film, I was excited to watch more M. Night Shyamalan films, and that eventually built my love for film. James Mcavoy in this film has an oscar worthy performance, playing 23 different personalities. Anya Taylor Joy also had a very good performance in this film and she played a very interesting character. The techniques for building and showing suspense was masterful in this movie, and the cinematography in this film was golden. The story in this film was also very investing, and its twist and turns are very fun. At first I didn't understand the twist ending, but after browsing the internet, I found out it involved a character from Unbreakable, and watching that movie was also a treat. I'm 14 years old right now, and my passion for film will live on! Split is one of my favorite films of all time and it is a film I will always love.","

"Split","roniksharma","1 October 2016","Shyamalan had his debut with the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' followed by positively reviewed movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. After that, he went through a series of duds with 'Lady In The Water' , 'The Village' , 'The Happening' , 'After Earth' and was termed one of the worst directors of all time with 'The Last Airbender'. But, he made a decent comeback with 2015's 'The Visit' which received generally positive reviews and he's back at his game with 'Split'.After a birthday party, three girls, led by Casey, are kidnapped by the troubled Kevin, who has a very rare case of 23 split personalities inside him. What follows is how the three girls try to escape from Kevin who himself is lowly having a mental breakdown. Sorry, I can't tell a lot about this movie as a small factor would spoil it.This movie couldn't have worked without James McAvoy. He has given his best performance in his whole career and stands out as one of the reasons to watch this movie. The cliché points in the movie are watchable just because of his phenomenal performance. His transition from a 'Norman Bates' type woman Patrica to a 9 year old boy Hedwig to other personalities are amazingLast but not the least, is the traditional ""Shyamalan Twist"". Trust me, this time your minds will be blown when you come to the conclusion. This twist doesn't match up to the ""The Sixth Sense"" one but it's a thrilling one. It's not some stupid twist like in ""Signs"". I won't forget that moment when someone behind me shouted out ""WHAAAAT?!"".""Split"" isn't scary, it's tense. This movie shouldn't have been given a ""horror"" tag. A ""psychological thriller"" sounds better. Nevertheless, this movie is worth a watch. I'm giving a 8/10 with one extra star just for James McAvoyWelcome back, M.Night Shyamalan","

One scene in particular has him cycling through three completely different personalities of his character at the drop of a hat, which is quite remarkable. The twist at the end is so disappointing that it is almost non-existent, those who have not watched the movie Unbreakable won't even understand the twist. At least this movie will keep you entertained and is not as atrociously paced as most of M. Night Shymalan's movies.","

"Split","msbreviews","6 August 2017","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)James McAvoy plays Kevin, a man with a genetic disease which allows him to have multiple personalities. His trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), knows 23 of them, but there's one hidden from everyone who desires to dominate over all the others. Compelled by one of his personalities, Kevin abducts three girls, where Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) becomes their leader to try and escape the ""crazy"" man.Is this the return to form by M. Night Shyamalan, who has been struggling for more than a decade to release a major success? Is Split the movie that brings him back to the spotlight?Once again, Shyamalan's storytelling is very original, unconventional and ultimately mind-blowing. Instead of establishing everything the audience needs to know about the characters right at the beginning, he gradually develops them, giving them haunting backstories and spreading parts of it throughout the runtime. That said, this film isn't for everyone. The audience needs to trust Shyamalan and be patient. Really patient. Don't start taking notes about something that you think it's negative because once you reach the third act, everything changes and suddenly it all makes sense. The screenplay is not as twisty as Unbreakable, for example, but it demands absolute attention in order to catch up on all the things that matter (and the ones that don't, as well).The production and editing team have to be congratulated due to their seamless work. From the camera work to the extended one-take sequences, as well as the environment surrounding the characters, everything feels real and looks amazing. The soundtrack ... Let me just say that this element is so, but so much relevant to the conclusion of this movie. I can't really say anything else without spoiling the ending, so I'll leave a note after my rating at the end of the review with a MAJOR SPOILER.As for the cast, I'll start with the man that I honestly think should have received an Oscar nomination: James McAvoy. You know, there's a big difference in portraying a non-fiction character instead of a fiction one: concerning the former, you can't really escape the true nature of the person you are playing, but with the latter, as an actor/actress, you have to deliver yourself 100% to the role for it to be believable ... And God, does McAvoy deliver! He gives 200% in what could be his best performance to date. Do you think Andy Serkis had problems portraying both Gollum and Sméagol at the same time? Well, imagine 7 ... or 8 characters. I lost the count. All in all, James McAvoy, sir, congratulations! You are superb!Anya Taylor-Joy is also incredible as Casey! Her character has the most intriguing story of the three girls, and she's the one who assumes the leadership of the group once the kidnap occurs. Her initially unknown past helps her through the traumatic situation, but it's really her rather captivating backstory that grabbed my attention. It's fundamental to the understanding of the ending and Anya does a terrific job. I also want to give a small praise to Betty Buckley for a beautiful and necessary interpretation of Dr. Fletcher, a character that offers the audience some knowledge of Kevin's disease.As for the other two kidnapped girls, well ... They're my main issue with the film since they don't have a good reason to be there. Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) aren't the main characters, and they don't have that much screen time, but their dialogue still feels extremely forced and filled with a lot of nonsense. The ending of the story might not be as twisty as in other Shyamalan's installments, but I hope that people don't give up to false expectations. The classic Shyamalan's twisty ending isn't a necessary attribute of his movies, but the truth is that the twist is not the one you think it is. Once again, the note at the end of my review will clarify this.In the end, Split is Shyamalan's return to his old early 2000's self. Brilliantly unconventional storytelling, a lot of suspense, some very captivating subplots and a fantastic editing and production team behind him. The soundtrack plays a huge role in this film, as well as James McAvoy, who delivers his career-best performance. Anya Taylor-Joy is also pretty extraordinary, something that can't be said about her fellow friends who portrayed two bland characters. The ending brings the classic twist that makes everything more understandable, and I gotta say ... I love this film, and it is one of 2017's best!MAJOR SPOILER BELOWAs I said above, the soundtrack plays a huge role in the ending twist. That's because the soundtrack that plays right before the title of the movie appears on the screen, is the same one as in the third act of Unbreakable.This is one of the many clues throughout the film that hint at the idea that Split belongs to Unbreakable's universe. Naturally, after the title shows up, there's a scene with David Dunn (Bruce Willis) that confirms this theory, but these are little details that make Shyamalan into a great director and screenwriter. Also, it's a pity that I've only watched these movies after Shyamalan stating that they were part of an eventual trilogy. Not that I was not surprised at the end of Split, but it did remove that first impact of pure shock in knowing that two films separated by 17 years (in real life) are part of the same universe.Both movies end up falling into the ""superhero"" genre. Unbreakable is the story of our ""hero"" who spent his whole life sad because he wasn't doing ""what he was supposed to do"", and Split is an origin story of our ""villain"". If Glass delivers, this might be one of the best ""superhero"" trilogies ever.","

"Split","Foolish","18 May 2018","After watching this movie, I have to say, I don't understand all the one and two star reviews. This is a return to form for the director of the excellent SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. I haven't enjoyed most of his output since those first two films, but only titles like his misguided LAST AIRBENDER and the truly terrible THE HAPPENING are deserving of such low marks. I've seen a few real one star movies, and SPLIT isn't one of them. It's definitely worthy of higher marks. I can only assume those who didn't like it are trying to lower the average rather than rank it realistically somewhere closer to 4 or 5 stars (although I'd rank it higher).It's a lot of fun. James MacAvoy is great in a subgenre that is normally pretty insipid (ie dissociative identity disorder movies). He deliveres a great performance that really helps to carry this film, and Betty Buckley also gives a notably outstanding performance in her supporting role.Is it as good as THE SIXTH SENSE? No. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. I'd happily see it again.As for those reviewers who are upset that movies like this distort the public perceptions about mental illness, I can only assume they are too close to that subject to be truly objective.","

"Split","TheLittleSongbird","4 February 2017","As said in my recent review for 'The Visit', M Night Shyamalan is one inconsistent director, with films that have fallen on both extreme sides of the film spectrum. The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender', 'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.'Split' now replaces 'The Visit' as Shyamalan's best film since 'The Village. Neither were perfect films or were to me the returns to form often touted, both with many great things which made it more frustrating that they also had flaws big enough to stop them from living to full potential. Ranking 'Split' with the rest of the films, it's for me one of his better ones (while 'The Visit' is somewhere in the middle), not a patch on 'Unbreakable' and especially 'The Sixth Sense' but certainly better than all his previous films post-'The Village' (and that is saying volumes, due to that the least bad of his ""panned"" films 'Lady in the Water' was still poor).The best thing about 'Split' is the performance of James McAvoy, who has never been creepier on film and it is a side that is just startling to watch. He has a very difficult role here, with 20+ very contrasting personalities sometimes having to change without warning quite violently and absolutely nails it in a way that one wouldn't think would expect from him. Anya Taylor Joy is more than up to his level in an enigmatic turn that combines shock, spunk and pathos. As is Betty Buckley in a sympathetic role that she does a lot with.Production design, lighting and effects have a real eeriness that adds hugely to the atmosphere, while the cinematography is significantly better than it was in 'The Visit', having an audacious and atmospheric professionalism and not done with a technique that will alienate (and has alienated) many. The music is suitably eerie, and Shyamalan does direct more than competently in building on the scares and tension.Apart from an ever so slightly dull beginning, much of the film up to the last half an hour is genuinely scary and suspenseful, with many twisty suspenseful turns, a sense of fun, frightening chills and contortions enough to bend the mind, more than delivering on the horror and psychological thriller elements.However, the last half an hour does disappoint, with a revelation that while certainly not obvious (far from it, actually very much unexpected) is revealed prematurely still which does hurt the momentum and tension, horror and suspense is replaced by head-scratching confusion (in the execution that is because it did feel muddled and under-explained) and behaviours and decisions that will induce groans of frustration. Unfortunately that last personality was as far from realistic or properly scary as one could possibly get (not McAvoy's fault at all, actually he did give the needed creepiness, but what he was given which was goofy), coming over as pretty silly actually and that jarred.Writing could have been much better, with a better and less awkward flow, the dialogue could have been less clunky and forced as well as less sloppily melodramatic. The victims also were written very lazily, constantly making stupid and illogical decisions that makes one frustrated at them rather than rooting for them.On the whole, fairly split here. A lot of great merits but could have been better. Still one of Shyamalan's better films, just not enough to make me proclaim ""he's back!"" 6/10 Bethany Cox","

"Split","zardoz-13","6 February 2017","If tour-de-force performances alone constituted great cinema, then ""Sixth Sense"" writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"" would rate as one of the best. Instead, Shyamalan's twelfth movie boils down to a straightforward, low-budget, abduction thriller, with a cannibalistic serial killer. The difference is this serial killer is a colorful basket case, a character teeming with more identities than you can count on all fingers and toes. As the traumatized casualty of an abusive mom, woebegone protagonist Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy of ""Victor Frankenstein"") has forged a 'horde' of personalities to serve as a bulwark against the atrocity of real-life. Predictable, derivative, and sometimes preposterous, ""Split"" benefits largely from McAvoy's nuanced performance as well as Shyamalan's usual last-minute surprises. ""Split"" feels like an 'origins' film. Not only is the protagonist a villain, but he also remains at large. The heroine is one of his hostages. Naturally, McAvoy has a field day chewing the scenery as a wacko with 23 personalities who is gestating number twenty-four. Basically, this charming but deranged ding-a-ling abducts three pretty little things from a Philadelphia shopping mall and confines them for his own culinary delight in an underground facility from which escape is virtually impossible. Compared with other movies about split-personality psychos, ""Split"" features a wackadoodle serial killer who isn't presented as a maniac out of a Rob Zombie splatter film. McAvoy's chameleon-like capacity to shift from one identity to another in the wink of an eye is as fluid as if he were genuinely conflicted himself. Suffice to say, McAvoy is nothing short of brilliant as Kevin Wendell Crumb. Were it not for one of the three captives, ""Split"" would have probably focused entirely on Kevin and not been as dramatic. Casey Cook is one of the kidnapped girls, but she is nothing like the other girls. Unfortunately, we see only eight of the twenty-three fruitcakes that McAvoy portrays, but none is either demonic or original. Meanwhile, two of those four other characters lack sympathy because they brought this tragedy on themselves by ridiculing this psycho. What ""Split"" does better than anything else is create a strong, memorable villain, and McAvoy fleshes it out in a bravura performance. Shyamalan conjures up a modicum of suspense toward the end when the girls try desperately to escape. Sometimes, this above-average suspense proves aggravating because you realize how futile it is for these doomed characters to survive.Like Kevin, Casey Cook (Anya Taylor-Joy of ""The Witch"") has been forged in the crucible of child abuse, too. A heart attack killed her father (Sebastian Arcelus of ""Ted 2"") while she was attending elementary school. Sadly, her father's brother, Uncle John (Brad William Henke of ""Fury""), became Casey's guardian. Without divulging too much information, Casey and her stepfather have had an abusive relationship. Now, in high school, Casey prefers to keep to herself. Two of her snobbish classmates, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson of ""The Edge of Seventeen"") and Claire's African-American friend Marcia (Jessica of ""Honeytrap""), invite her to their birthday party more out of pressure rather than friendship. Indeed, they harbor cynical attitudes about Casey, but they fear the social media repercussions about what they might have faced had they not invited Casey. When her ride doesn't materialize, Casey agrees to accompany Claire and Marcia and listen to Claire's father (Brian Gildea) who loves to tell terrible jokes. As the saying goes, Hell is a road paved with good intentions, and Claire and Marcia have provided the asphalt that puts Casey in harm's way. Before they can pull out of the parking lot, a total stranger, Kevin Wendell Crumb, dispenses with Claire's dad and then carjacks them. Slipping on a face mask, he sprays something in their eyes that plunges them into oblivion. Of course, had they not been paralyzed with fear, these girls could have fled before Kevin incapacitated them. When they awaken, the girls find themselves locked up in a room with the same tight-lipped stranger staring at them. Eventually, they discover something is seriously amiss with their captor. Every time Crumb appears, he masquerades as an entirely different individual, sometimes even as a woman. What the three girls don't realize is that Kevin is a patient of a world-renowned psychotherapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley of ""Frantic""), who has terribly misjudged the threat that he poses to society. Repeatedly, Kevin warns her about 'the beast' and how this Messianic personality will shield all twenty-three personalities from scorn and ridicule. When 'the beast' shows up, ""Split"" turns into a warped Marvel Comics movie because this side of Kevin possesses supernatural characteristics.Basically, ""Split"" is a standard-issue serial killer saga. Neither the police nor the FBI interfere in ""Split,"" which differentiates it from movies like ""Manhunter."" Shyamalan confines the action primarily to several underground rooms and one in a luxurious apartment. Shyamalan fashions some mildly suspenseful scenes, especially when the girls try to break out in the end. When the time comes for him to depict death, Shyamalan doesn't indulge himself as Eli Roth of ""Hostel"" infamy might. Nevertheless, the action amounts to a predictable series of episodic encounters between McAvoy's various personalities and his victims. Aside from Kevin Wendell Crumb, Casey qualifies as the only other genuinely interesting character. The two snobbish girls might as well have been mannequins. They are expendable, and they behave like whiny victims in a movie where whiny victims die. Most of Shyamalan's surprises occur exactly when you expect them, though two deserve back-to-back ""WOWS!"" because they come both as a relief and surprise! The outcome of Casey's hostile clash with 'the Beast' salvages this otherwise predictable potboiler. Bruce Willis's cameo in the final scene as security guard David Dunn brings ""Split"" into the ""Unbreakable"" timeline. Moreover, two characters at a diner compare Crumb to Glass! Ultimately, Shyamalan wants moviegoers to see James McAvoy's conflicted serial killer in ""Split"" in the same light as Alfred Hitchcock's classic chiller ""Psycho"" with Anthony Perkins as the protagonist.","

"Split","Quinoa1984","27 January 2017","Split is a film that asks you to suspend your disbelief, and at first, even after the many films that this director has done where he goes way too far, I was with Split for about the first half of the way through, or maybe more. I knew logically this is not how DID works (Disassociative Identity Disorder), but hey, it's a movie, let's go with it. And to Shyamalan's credit, he casts the two major parts to the point where it's key and it works. And as a director, overall, and in large part thanks to the cinematographer behind It Follows, it's a film directed with real terror and suspense. It's low-budget, largely a 'bottle' film, and he uses his money with true style. It's paced well... where was I (now I feel like I got this disorder and will become two different critics here, gotta control...)Oh, yeah, James McAvoy, he's fantastic. He may not be playing 23 personalities in total, but the ones that Shyamalan focuses on are developed enough - among them is Barry (a gay fashion designer that McAvoy sort of plays like a young Pacino or something, in the physicality), Dennis (the one who may seem to be in 'control' and is extremely OCD about any dirt) and Hedwig (who is nine years old, and you can tell) - give McAvoy enough room to explore these personalities. There's times of awkward laughter at first, but this gives way to seeing that McAvoy is so committed to these characters, and is pulling them all of with intensity and charm and disbelief and a madness that is kind of similar to them all, that he's impossible to dislike.Another key player is Ana Taylor Joy, as she's the one of the three girls that we get to know the most (though with this we get into something of a, for me, forced motivation, but I'll get to that later), and she is on for all of these interactions with McAvoy. She's the one who can somehow speak to Hedwig sympathetically and connect with him, and when she is freaking out and trying to hold things inside, she does this perfectly. Between this and The VVitch she is really on a roll as a major actress for thrillers - she can play terrified, but being in control and being bad-ass works as well. And for a lot of the scenes the actress playing the psychiatrist, Betty Buckley, is believable, as far as she can take the lines to...Okay, here's where we get into the DID here with this movie in reality, it's with its writer AND then also its director. I don't mean the same person, I mean they are separate entities. Shyamalan the director is on top of his game here, with a formal rigor that hasn't clicked this week in well over a decade (it may even connect to Unbreakable, which... oh, more on that at the end of this). Shyamalan the *writer* is something else. He's still someone who thinks he's oh, so, so clever, and you know what? For that first half or so, he kind of is. At least, again, when it comes to the suspension-of-disbelief factor. He does a more than competent job of giving us a believable enough set-up with these girls being held captive, Barry putting up his false front when emailing but then denying anything is wrong to the doctor, and then how the personalities have their splits with the girls and how they are trying (unsuccessfully to escape)... but then Shyamalan the writer gets greedy. Or insane. Or both.The biggest problem here is that this man is CHEATING by the end of this, and in a way that is baffling. He can't have enough with having this somewhat preposterous thriller about a man juggling all these personalities that may lead up to ""The Beast"", the 24th personality. No, it needs to be deeper than that. It also needs to involve child molestation - not just with this man, but the Ana Taylor Joy character when she was younger - and that this, uh, maybe leads into having these super DID powers(!?) He's creating a whacked-out mythology where one needn't exist, and by the time the third act takes off, and you can mark it as soon as the Buckley character comes to Barry/Dennis/Hedwig/Patricia/Et-Al's basement dwelling, it fully goes into bananas territory.I know, I know, it's a thriller, I know I should keep buying into what this is selling... but I just couldn't. Most of all (oh, hell, you got this far in this review) it's the gall to turn this around to make this as part of a, uh, Shyamalan Cinematic Universe with a Bruce Willis Unbreakable cameo that brings me into the 'you're cheating!' territory. Perhaps this is simply this man's M.O. as far as crafting his material, that he can see ahead and know that this is what he has to do, and that everything ties together... or he wrote himself into a corner, realized he was writing sheer insanity as far as where McAvoy goes in this final third, and had to cover up. Either way, it might work for you... or it may feel like him f***ing with all of us. At any rate, all of the material with The Beast has the sensation of Shyamalan as mad mainstream provocateur, like 'hey, how far can I actually take this stuff, you've come this far right, eh, right? RIGHT?!' To his credit, this is a more enjoyable piece of madness than The Village, and its final third makes it something I want to revisit simply to show friends in a 'Look upon this wonder in awe' way like The Happening. I think among the Shyamalan *bad* movies, and this is bad make no mistake, it's directed like a pro and the actors are all on their game, and becomes the best of them.","

Night being one of my favorite directors/producers I just up and decided to give him one more chance with ""Split"" and I'm so glad I did. This was classic M. Night all the way from the twists and the unpredictable story-line to the scares and the edge of your seat thrills. This is just a great horror/thriller played out as a far fetched psychological thriller. It's well written and the plot is laid out perfectly to the end and If you like older M.

But mostly people did like this and it almost seems like he made a comeback. If you thought he vanished that is of course. The script is tight and the movie has a lot of memorable moments (most of them being weird), although one of the biggest can be seen in the trailer, which is unfortunate.There's also another scene where M.Night can be seen. His Hitchcock moment as some call it (I think he himself too). Letthis argument not spoil the fun you may be having with this one. The overall acting is good (apart from the one cameo I just mentioned, which is cringe-worthy) and the tension is there until the end.

"Split","parry_na","2 February 2017","Two smartphone distracted girls and their 'weird' friend are kidnapped by an unknown assailant who carries out the action without any emotion whatsoever.'Barry' is a model employee. He's been ill, but is better now. Doctor Fletcher (Betty Buckley) says this. We learn of 'Barry's' disorder because Fletcher is trying to widen awareness for his condition. The information about what is known as 'DID' is staggered throughout, at length, and her scenes are interspersed with 'Barry' and his other personalities presenting themselves to his three prisoners. One of these is an upper-class woman called 'Patricia', another is an irritant called 'Hedwig', another is a nuisance called 'Dennis' (who likes to watch girls dance naked). In reality, his name is Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), and he has 23 personalities.Despite claims that, for example, if one personality is a weight-lifter he possesses the strength of a weight-lifter whilst other shared personalities do not, McAvey doesn't have the physical presence to portray anyone that couldn't just be over-powered by the three girls – or even just one of them (with a more sustained battering than just hitting him once and then turning their back on him, something that happens more than once). Despite the theatrical rolling eyes, the lisp, the change of clothes, he simply isn't frightening. His endless talking about himself makes it clear that his characters are a lot more interesting to him than to the audience – or at least, this member of it. I can appreciate a committed performance, but sadly he leaves me cold.Perhaps to balance out Kevin's multiple characteristics, the three girls have only one personality between them. Being the allegedly 'weird' one of the trio, it is Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who had been so good in 2015's 'The Witch') to whom 'Dennis' is attracted, because of course weirdness is an elite exclusive club that joins every outsider together, provided you're pretty enough ('the broken are the more evolved,' apparently). Luckily for flesh fans, one of Kevin's personalities suffers from OCD, necessitating the young captives to remove much of their 'dirty' clothing. Another box ticked.There have been accusations that 'Split' is offensive to sufferers of mental health disorders. In an age where being offended is a competitive sport, presumably any piece of fiction involving death, for instance, is offensive to anyone who has ever suffered bereavement and therefore 'shouldn't be allowed'. This is a point of view that stifles creativity, fiction, drama and/or many levels of art. That is not the problem with 'Split' in my view. It is an idea that is ripe with potential but simply stretched out very thinly over almost two hours with very little incident. In fact, the kidnapping of three girls is the only incident. Endless scenes of talking about 'Barry's' condition isn't entertaining, frightening or effecting. It very quickly becomes dull and stays that way.Director M. Night Shyamalan had a great success with 'The Sixth Sense' in 1999, especially its twist ending. Subsequently, all his films have ended with a similar surprise, each one less effective than the last. If you make it to the end of this, there is a revelation that (SPOILERS) Kevin's affliction appears to be supernatural. 'The Beast' is physically bulkier than his other personalities, can hop from wall to wall and is impervious to bullets. This ends with a reference to Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' via a Bruce Willis cameo which pre-supposes you are on familiar terms with that film, which is presumptuous, as this is not billed as a sequel.","

"Split","trublu215","12 January 2017","M. Night Shyamalan's Split pits a ground of teenage girls against their captor (James McAvoy) and his plethora of multiple personalities with each personality ranging from harmless to deadly. First off, I want to say, I did enjoy the first hour or so of this film. It was creepy, tense, tasteless but fun. Then the final hour comes steam rolling everything in its wake including all the thought and caring that we've grown to have over the course of the previous hour. It is not one thing or another, it's a willingness to halt the film's growth as it's own and by the final minute of the film, everyone will know what I am talking about. As for spoilers, I'm not going to spoiling anything which makes my thoughts that much harder to gather. While I'm not a complete film snob, I do expect certain things going into an M. Night Shyamalan film. If you were talking to me before The Village, I'd say that I would expect a creepy atmospheric film. If you're asking me post-Village, I'd simply say ""Dear God, I hope it's good."" The Visit was somewhat back on track for him so I was excited to see this but instead I'm leaving this film actually giving up hope. The twist is so lazy and so out-of-left- field that it diminishes any sort of weight. It is merely a gimmick rather than a clever little twist, especially for a Shyamalan film. Honestly, it single handily ruined the film for me. It is a singular moment that completely drains Split of any real merit as a standalone film.Like I said, James McAvoy gives a chilling performance that sometimes goes over-the-top but still maintains a level of creepiness without it ever being overbearing. Anya Taylor-Joy gives a very good performance as well as Casey, who gives a better performance here than in last year's terrifying yet overrated The Witch. The rest of the cast plays out the typical female horror characters to a fault and actually fails to breathe new life in a very tiring role.Overall, Split is a film that could have cut out it's so-called ""twist"" and been a fun midnight movie, a solid 7/10. But instead M. Night Shyamalan delivers his laziest twist to date in hopes of continuing the trend that is a M. Night Shyamalan film. A term that used to mean something, now is played out to a gimmicky effect and we all know Shyamalan is so much better than that. And while I'm sure the ""twist"" will wet some hardcore fans' appetite, it made the film that much more trivialized.","

"Split","moviewizguy","18 January 2017","1. Obviously, the first thing that should be mentioned is James McAvoy's amazing performance. He is genuinely good and convincing as he weaves in and out of vastly different personalities, sometimes in the same scene.2. Anya Taylor-Joy is a joy to watch as well. Her character has quite a bit of depth than the trailer suggests.3. Rejoice for Betty Buckley! Those who thought she was awful in THE HAPPENING will find her lovely in this film.4. As for the other two girls in the film - Haley Lu Richardson (who was wonderful in THE EDGE OF SEVENTEEN) and Jessica Sula - are serviceable but not entirely memorable.5. Special shoutout to Izzie Coffey. Shyamalan always has a knack for finding talented young actors.6. My favorite personality? Hedwig. He is a delight every time he's on screen. Etcetera.7. Barry comes a close second. Seeing McAvoy play a homosexual character is as wonderful as it sounds.8. I would have liked to see more of Kevin himself.9. And in that line of thought, I would have liked to see more of the other personalities as well.10. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Not a surprise since Mike Gioulakis shot IT FOLLOWS.11. So is the score. This is Shyamalan's first parting from his go-to collaborator, James Newton Howard (unless you count Paul Cantelon's small contribution in THE VISIT). While a shame, West Dylan Thordson more than makes up for Newton Howard's absence, providing an atmospheric and surprisingly empathetic score in certain scenes.12. Most inventive opening/closing credits ever? I think so.**13. Don't let anyone spoil this movie for you. Just don't.**14. I've already seen the film twice within 5 days of each other. I liked it more the second time.15. But I still prefer THE VISIT. Some reasons:16. The climax is really underwhelming. It works thematically/symbolically, but the payoff falls short.17. On top of that, the third act itself could have been crazier.18. The structure gets repetitive.19. The runtime is a bit long as well.20. As a matter of fact, the film has many problems.21. But there are risks taken here, and SPLIT is admirable for that.22. In fact, the film goes to some truly dark territory, especially for its PG-13 rating.23. Overall thoughts? SPLIT is a really good January movie.24. But I don't doubt that audiences will be split on the film.","

"Split","kluseba","3 February 2017","Just like ""The Visit"" a year earlier, Shyamalan's new movie ""Split"" offers a great mixture of psychological suspense, horror elements and an emotional drama with a lot of depth. The great story line, the tense atmosphere and the stunning acting pardon for the lack of a real twist as we usually get from Shyamalan.The story is quickly told. A man diagnosed with twenty-three different personalities kidnaps three teenage girls and keeps them in an abandoned basement. The girls quickly realize that they can manipulate some of the split personalities while others are very hostile to them. It becomes obvious that the twenty-three personalities prepare for the emergence of a twenty-fourth personality called the beast that plans to feast on the teenagers' impure bodies. The three girls must find a strategy to escape before their lives will be in danger. At the same time, the psychologist of the man with the numerous personalities realizes that something seems to be wrong with her patient during their therapy sessions. Will the girls manage to escape and the psychologist find out the truth before it's too late?The movie develops a quite diversified pace right from the start. The teenagers get kidnapped within the first five minutes of the movie and have to face one of the more aggressive personalities right from the start. The movie then slows down and presents us seven of the twenty-three different personalities. The film also gives us background information thanks to therapy sessions with the perpetrator and his psychologist as well as flashbacks of one of the girls that will become more and more important throughout the movie. The last quarter of the film quickens up the pace and leads to a furious showdown and an interesting reference. If compared to Shyamalan's last movie, some questions are though left unanswered and indicate a potential sequel to this movie. The restricted space in the basement, the calm and precise camera work, the gloomy light effects and the sinister soundtrack progressively increase the uneasy atmosphere of the movie.James McAvoy has the challenging task to portray eight different personalities all at once and his acting performance alone elevates this movie to a very high level. He is credible in all of his roles and convinces as unpredictable patient that is both perpetrator and victim at the same time. This unprecedented acting performance should be honoured with a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role next year. The main actress incarnated by the talented Anya Taylor-Joy is almost as perfect as her character develops a fascinating chemistry with the perpetrator. Initially, she seems to be a shy outcast but turns out to be a clever and empathic young moment who will fight relentlessly for her survival. She's the tragic heroine of this movie and empathic viewers will definitely care about her fate. She would also deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role next year. Among the secondary characters, Betty Buckley convinces in her role as open-minded psychologist who is walking a thin line between tolerance and insistence to uncover her patient's gloomy secret. I think she would deserve a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress next year. Overall, the cast is really convincing and easily the best in the psychological horror genre since Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"".The only reason why this movie didn't get all ten points are a few minor lengths in the story telling during the first half of the film and the fact that the movie didn't come around with a stunning twist in the key of many of Shyamalan's previous works. Still, ""Split"" is an extraordinary psychological thriller with an intense plot, an uneasy atmosphere and absolutely outstanding acting. Genre fans might even have their best movie of the year right here. Even those who like to criticize Shyamalan should admit that ""Split"" is a success and one of the best movies in his career. This film should definitely be rewarded with awards and is one of the few Hollywood movies that actually deserves all the attention it gets.","

However, I stopped watching him after the Happening, (which was really quite a terrible movie. No comment on The Last Airbender). This is such a wonderful comeback. His ability to totally freak you out without being terrifying; to keep you fascinated, yet completely confused, it's all just so much fun! Not sure how his films can be so slow yet so gripping and FUN! This one is bang on. The cinematography is wonderful, the story is intense and gripping. Not to mention that James Macavoy is bang on (what a great performance, love Joaquin Phoenix, but not sure he would have been quite so awesomely intense as Macavoy was). I highly recommend this film to any thriller lovers and a must for any M.Night lovers (but I don't need to say that at this point now, do I). I agree it's not a horror film but it does very get under your skin. (If you found The Ring too much, don't watch this!) However, if you loved The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, this is a must see!!

"Split","moonspinner55","27 January 2017","A return to the tried and true: M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"", which he wrote and directed (both rather clinically), opens with a distinct ""Silence of the Lambs"" vibe before eventually evolving into a continuation of themes Shyamalan used for his ""Unbreakable"". Three teenage girls in Philadelphia are abducted from a parking lot by a man with dissociative identity disorder; he harbors dozens of personalities--male, female and child--but the final one to present itself is calling for an alliance of ""the horde"", and may represent something superhuman. While the opening scenes do have a familiar ring, they are well-executed by the filmmaker, who gives the audience what its probably hoping for; but Shyamalan, to his credit (although some genre buffs might not be so generous), is aiming for something loftier than imprisoned girls attempting to escape from a psychotic. The film offers a dissertation on DID via the captor's somewhat-unwitting psychiatrist, who--via Skype!--gives a clinical rundown of the mental disorder to her colleagues (including case studies). None of this information, however interesting, is utilized in the final stretch, as Shyamalan is out to baffle us with a plot-twist that is both confounding and amusing. While ""Split"" is creepy on occasion, it isn't effective as a scary thriller. Maybe Shyamalan feels he's above giving his audience a shock, a jolt, but sometimes a few good clichés are better than a round-table discussion. ** from ****","

"Split","room102","27 January 2017","I guess the fact that I actually wanted to watch an M. Night Shyamalan movie (haven't done that since THE HAPPENING (2008)) and actually sat through the entire movie (losing interest while watching it) is an achievement by itself. Still, it was everything I expected from a Shyamalan movie and from watching the trailer. James McAvoy is too talented for this silly movie, which had a big potential in terms of plot, but it was reduced to the regular Shyamalan garbage. It starts well, but gets worse and worse until it reaches the awful silly ending.BTW, although Anya Taylor-Joy is a main character, I think she has less lines of dialog than Arnie in the first TERMINATOR.As always, Shyamalan has to give himself a silly cameo. And the last scene... oh, god, the cringe.This film is only worth watching for James McAvoy.","

It turned out to be one of his worst. I give up on him. Everything since the Sixth Sense has been a let down.The story is awful - not clever just irritating and unpleasant. 3 teenagers get kidnapped by a man with split personalities. Of course you want to see what happens if the girls live or die but it wasn't scary just boring and predictable.It's good Betty Buckley had a big role as the psychiatrist. She is so talented she deserves a resurrection in her film career. Unfortunately the character she plays is rather dumb. James MacAvoy tries hard with the material - A for effort. But he is not Sally Field in Sybil.Unequivocally this movie is no good.","

Soon they learn that the man has DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) with several personalities. His psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) is aware of his personalities but does not suspect that he is the kidnapper of the three girls. Casey, who has been abused by her Uncle John (Brad William Henke) since she was a kid, tries to manipulate the weakest personalities to escape. But the problem is that the strong personality The Beast is quite unleashed and is coming. ""Split"" is another annoying and silly film by the mediocre and overrated M. Night Shyamalan. This director / writer made success with the rip-off of ""Haunted"" (1995) and now uses the concept of the masterpiece ""Identity"" (2003) to make ""Split"". James McAvoy's character is not scary but laughable and ridiculous. The psychologist is absolutely incompetent and only Casey Cooke is a promising character wasted by the terrible screenplay. The conclusion is maybe the worst part of this forgettable film. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Fragmentado"" (""Shattered"")","

"Split","Sober-Friend","25 April 2017","M. Night Shyamalan hit the big time with ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999. His follow up films have been not just been huge disappoints but truly some of the worse films I had to sit through. ""Unbreakable"" was just stupid and so was ""Signs"" and ""The Village"". I did not even bother to watch ""The Lady in the Water"" and other celluloid manure he created. So last night against my better judgment I saw ""Split"" which was just an exercise in patience. M. Night Shyamalan proves he likes to not only bore his audience but he also loves steel money from studios that still will back his films.In this film M. Night Shyamalan had an interesting gem of an idea about a crazy man who kidnaps 3 girls. The Three teenagers, Claire, Marcia, and outsider Casey, are kidnapped and held captive by ""Dennis"", one of 23 personalities present in the mind of Kevin Wendell Crumb, a victim of childhood abuse diagnosed with identity disorder. The film however fails to engage the audience. A few scenes work but they are out numbered by the scenes that don't. The film of course has a ""Minor"" twist at the end but its more like a winks to the audience for fans of one of the directors other films. A much better film that dealt with split personalities is ""Raising Cain"" and ""Sisters"". It least those films were done by craftsmen that knew how to engage an audience. He still has lots of fan who will hate this review. That's too bad that they will thumbs down this review when in fact they know this film is awful. They need to get a life","

"Split","dave-mcclain","20 January 2017","Dissociative Identity Disorder (known as DID, and previously called Multiple Personality Disorder) is a psychological disorder in which a single person displays multiple distinct personalities, often as a defense mechanism to help the original personality deal with some sort of emotional trauma, like that suffered as a result of child abuse. These personalities each have a distinct name and distinct personality traits. As you can imagine, this condition is shrouded in mystery, is especially difficult to diagnose and treat and can be very dangerous for the sufferer – and for those around him/her/them. Fascination with DID has been fodder for a number of movies over the years, most notably in 1976 when Sally Field played (and won an Emmy for) a made-for-TV version of the true story of a woman who had 16 different personalities. (""Sybil"" was remade, again for TV, in 2007, then starring Tammy Blanchard and Jessica Lange.) 2017 offers a fictional DID story in the form of the horror-thriller ""Split"" (PG-13, 1:57), written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan who also co-produces for the second time with Jason Blum and Marc Bienstock of Blumhouse Productions, which gave us horror franchises like ""Paranormal Activity"".James McAvoy is Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man with 23 different personalities inside his head, but who is still able to function in society. He lives on his own, has held a good job for ten years, and regularly sees his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). She finds it difficult to treat Kevin, but she cares a great deal about his mental health and she makes herself available to him 24/7. She also finds it difficult to gain professional acceptance for the things she is learning about DID by working with Kevin. And it can be especially difficult for Dr. Fletcher to know which of Kevin's personalities with whom she is speaking. For a while now, she's been dealing primarily with Kevin's artistic personality, known as Barry, but something has changed in her recent sessions with Kevin. She senses it, but isn't sure what it means.However, three young women are experiencing firsthand what has changed in Kevin. High school friends Claire and Marcia (Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula) are giving a ride to strange loner Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) when Kevin suddenly gets into their car, incapacitates the three of them and takes them to some sort of underground facility in which he lives and has built a room to hold the girls. Actually, it was Dennis, Kevin's most forceful personality, who abducted the three, but they don't understand what is going on, why they've been taken or what they should do about it. Disagreements over how to work together to escape and the emergence of Dennis' fellow ""alters"" keep them off balance, but when they do take action, their attempts to resist just make matters worse for them. With the obvious exception of their captive state, the girls are unharmed, but it becomes clear that something bad is about to happen.""Split"" is an outstanding return to form for Shyamalan and one of the best horror-thrillers in years. Looking at audience and critics' ratings reveals that there was a slow, but steady decline in the popularity of his films after he burst into the public consciousness with his Best Picture Oscar-nominated 1999 drama-mystery-thriller ""The Sixth Sense"". That decline bottomed out with 2010's ""The Last Airbender"", but rebounded slightly with 2013's ""After Earth"". The reception for his films improved further with his 2015 horror-thriller ""The Visit"", his first film with Blumhouse Productions, who gave Shyamalan more artistic freedom than he had enjoyed in many years. Although ""Split"" doesn't feature one of his trademark mind-bending twists, it's his best film in 10-15 years.Here, he has made a movie with an original concept, a compelling narrative and genuine tension which gradually builds. It helps that this is an especially well-acted horror film. McAvoy transforms himself (physically, emotionally and regarding audience perceptions of him), Buckley turns in her most powerful performance since the original ""Carrie"" in 1976 and Taylor-Joy follows up her under-appreciated work in 2016's ""The Witch"" and ""Morgan"" showing that she's one of the most talented young actresses of the mid-late 2010s. And, almost as much as this film showing that Shyamalan is very much back as a director, his fans will appreciate seeing two actors from his earlier films in the cast and one killer reference to one of those films in the closing credits. ""Split"" is not to be missed. ""A""","

"Split","bob the moo","22 September 2019","It was the recent release of Glass that made me decide to watch this film, despite its so-so reviews; I wanted to watch the former, and it didn't feel right to skip right to it. The film opens with a creepy setup, and gradually plays out the multiple personalities of the main characters, while at the same time increasing the tension through the peril of the young women trapped somewhere. In terms of stakes and tension, it mostly does it well, with an escalation as the film goes, but the film is not tight enough to be event driven, and at two hours there is lots of material which seemed intended to do something, but mostly doesn't deliver.It is an odd film in this way, because there is a lot here to work with, but too much of it is superficial. It plays very much like a first or second draft; so for example there are elements so undercooked that it feels like the type of material that would have been taken out later down the road to try to make more space for other elements, or just recognizing that it adds time but not value. Casey's flashbacks add almost nothing - not because they are a bad idea, but because they are not worked through enough; the film would have lost almost nothing by removing them. Likewise, the battle within the main character doesn't have a sense of struggle really; it could have been much more, and thus the conclusion could have been more impacting, but it doesn't have much in the way of weight or emotion behind it. Again, there was much more writing and refining to be done here.It is a shame, because the cast deserve more than they have to work with. McAvoy is great as he slips between characters totally convincingly; he throws himself into this and almost singlehandedly makes the film worth seeing. Taylor-Joy is almost as good because of how she plays her fear; while the film doesn't help the viewer connect to her 5-year old self, the actresses seems to have found it, and there is more in her performance than the film lets us see. Probably the blame should be laid at the feet of Shyamalan; he wrote and directed this, and it is very his type of weakness - he wants the concept and idea to be the thing, but the depth etc he is not often able to find. The film running long and having too much in it is probably down to him too - editor Ciarrocchi seems to have his career thanks to Shyamalan, so he is unlikely to be tough in the edit.Split squanders a lot - a couple of very good performances, and a generally interesting concept and through-line mostly. It lays out its plot in semi-cooked chunks and then serves them up like an early draft - some of it needed chucking, and the rest needed improving; but it doesn't do either.","

"Split","Coventry","10 January 2020","I completely gave up on M. Night Shyamalan between 2005 and 2015. Talking in film titles, that means between ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Visit"". I always thought his supposedly greatest accomplishments ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were vastly overrated (and even blatant rip-offs of obscure horror gems), but at least they were watchable. I severely disliked ""Signs"" and absolutely hated ""The Village"", so after that it was exit M. Night for me. From what I read on the internet, he only made rubbish and commercial flops in this 10-year-period anyway. ""Split"" seemed different. It has a more intriguing concept than all of Shyamalan's previous movies combined, and for the very first time, the plot genuinely appeals to fans of dark psycho-thrillers. Usually his stories are balancing on the verge of fantasy and melodrama, with a minor touch of morbidity.The first half of ""Split"" is really good! The script luckily doesn't waste too much time and almost immediately begins with the powerful and intense kidnapping sequence of three teenage girls - in broad daylight on a busy parking lot - by a sinister young man with an evil grimace on his face. The girls, two typically shallow beauties and one introvert girl with a troubled past, are taken to an unknown location and locked up in a sort of basement. What follows next are a good 40-45 minutes of terrific cinema during which the three girls, simultaneously with the audience, gradually learn that their kidnapper isn't just an ordinary maniac but a deeply disturbed schizophrenic with no less than 23 different personalities. The quiet girl, Casey, realizes their only chance for escape is by manipulating the weaker personalities, but there's also a 24th and ultimately evil alter ego brooding within Kevin.Lots of praise and respect for talented young actress Anya Taylor-Joy, and especially for James McAvoy as Barry, Kevin, Dennis, Hedwig, Patricia, etc. Okay, admittedly, it must be a dream come true for any actor to be offered the chance to play a character like this and demonstrate that you are capable of depicting a variety of roles, but still McAvoy puts a lot of passion and devotion in every single twisted personality! My personal favorite is definitely the posh, elderly lady with the dress and necklace. Best male-actor-playing-ugly-old-woman since Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", for sure! Sadly, M. Night's true personality also comes to the surface, and not even McAvoy can prevent ""Split"" from slowly turning into a dull and overly talkative B-thriller. Notably the conversations between whatever personality and his therapist are tedious and seem to last endlessly, but also Casey's cliched background story is quite redundant. Not sure what rating ""Split"" received, but the violence and murders all occur off screen, and that is a damn shame! I didn't like the ending (come to think of it, I never like the endings in Shyamalan's movies) but apparently it's the bridge towards a sequel/origin story ""Glass"".","

Once you forget about that and just go with the flow it's actually very entertaining.It has a deeper meaning and it gets dramatic at times but that gives it depth and takes you away from the supernatural of the script.

"Split","ferbs54","5 June 2018","Over the years, there have been any number of films that have dealt with lead characters who suffer with what the layman might term ""split personality."" Putting aside all the many iterations of the Jekyll & Hyde story, in 1957, audiences were given both ""Lizzie,"" in which Eleanor Parker played a woman with three distinct personalities, and, five months later, the more well-known ""The Three Faces of Eve,"" in which Joanne Woodward played a woman with the exact same predicament. In 1960, theatergoers were shocked out of their showers via their introduction to Tony Perkins' Norman Bates, a young man who was also his own mother, in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" The situation was played for laughs in 1963's ""The Nutty Professor,"" with Jerry Lewis portraying the hapless Prof. Julius Kelp AND his alter ego, the Dean Martin-like Buddy Love. But you would have to take all the preceding alter egos, and perhaps toss in later films such as 1992's ""Raising Cain"" (in which John Lithgow sported three personalities) and 2007's ""Sybil"" (in which the titular character, played by Tammy Blanchard, possessed no fewer than 16!), to exceed the number of disparate types to be found living inside one person, in M. Night Shyamalan's most recent offering, 2017's ""Split.""  The film introduces us to a most unusual character...or should I say, ""horde"" of characters (no wonder the news media later refers to this personage as ""The Horde""!). He is Kevin Wendell Crumb--brought to remarkable life by the Scottish actor James McAvoy--a Philadelphia native (as have been so many of the director/writer's previous lead characters) who suffers with the condition known as DID: dissociative identity disorder. As a matter of fact, his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), has identified no fewer than 23 (!) personalities residing inside his noggin, each waiting patiently in his or her ""chair"" for a chance to step forward ""into the light."" (And if this setup strikes some as being a bit improbable, I might add here that the real-life Eve evinced a full 22 personalities, and required a good 17 years of psychotherapy as a consequence!) Somehow, Crumb has managed to live a fairly low-key life in modern society, even managing to hold down a job as a dress designer, thanks to the talents of one of his many personae, Barry. But following a prank of a sexual nature perpetrated on him by a group of randy schoolgirls, Kevin snaps, and is soon seen kidnapping three young women in the parking lot of the King of Prussia Mall. Those three women--Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy)--are incarcerated in some kind of underground bunker, while their captor intimidates them as successive personalities of his step into the light. Thus, we get to see McAvoy essay a good half dozen of Kevin's 23 inner personae; for example, the 9-year-old Hedwig, the dressy Patricia, and the unflappably in-command Dennis. But Dr. Buckley grows increasingly concerned with her patient, when Dennis/Barry informs her that a 24th personality, which he terms ""The Beast,"" is soon to emerge. And since the good doctor knows that each of Kevin's personalities can effectively transform his body chemistry as it enters the light, there is every reason for concern...especially since this Beast is said to be extremely large, very fast, very powerful, able to climb walls (!) and, as it turns out, somewhat cannibalistic as regards dietary requirements.... ""Split"" was produced on a budget of a mere $9 million and proved to be a box office smash, bringing in around $280 million all told. And there was very good reason for this. The film is a remarkably suspenseful affair, and every attempt that our trio of young prisoners makes to escape from their cell is a nerve-racking one. The three young actresses on display here are all terrific, especially Taylor-Joy. Her Casey character is both beautiful and interesting, and the director shows us her history in flashbacks that allow us to see why she is so well suited to survive in this horrendous situation (her father had trained her in outdoor shooting and survival skills), and why she is the introverted young lady that she is today (a bit of sexual molestation on the part of a skeevy uncle would do that for anyone!). The film makes good use of its autumnal scenery--Philly and its surroundings have never looked more gorgeous--and Shyamalan's script is a clever one. But best of all is McAvoy, whose sextuple performance is practically Oscar worthy. Not since Alex Guinness in 1949's ""Kind Hearts and Coronets,"" in which the beloved British actor essayed no fewer than nine distinct roles, and perhaps Peter Sellers in 1964's ""Dr. Strangelove,"" in which the actor gave the world three entirely different and truly memorable characters, has a performer attempted such a feat, AND brought it off as successfully. And for those who are wondering if Shyamalan once again pulls the rug out from beneath his audience's expectations with one of his patented surprise endings, the answer is a decided ""yes""; an ending that sets the viewer up for a sequel that also ties into another of the director's previous films. I don't think I'm giving anything away here at this late date by saying that this sequel is to be entitled ""Glass,"" and that it will be coming out in January 2019. Personally, it is a film for which I cannot wait....","

"Split","Theo Robertson","29 January 2017","There's two ways to develop this ""psycho character kidnaps a trio of teenage girls"" type of plot . One is to make the girls and the audience squirm as they're subjected to all type of obscene practises in a torture porn type of tale . The other is to keep the horrors mainly psychological and understated and hope the actor playing the psycho isn't going to have too much fun in the role The good news is that SPLIT isn't torture porn . Even better news is while James McAvoy has fun in the role it's never enough to actually take you out of the movie . McAvoy is of course a Scottish actor from a working class background and it's usually a distraction watching ""one of us"" in a commercial Hollywood movie but here McAvoy delivers a pivotal role playing a character suffering from dissociative identity disorder . Okay it's obvious no one had an eye on the Oscars when this was released and McAvoy's character pieces are a bit episodic along with being intermittently camp but even so the film rests mainly on this performance !!!! TAKE NO CHANCES SUGGESTIVE SPOILER !!!!! M Night Shyamalan is a director whose string of flops over the last few years have made the average audience member totally forget that he was once being touted as the new Spielberg and the temptation to do a sequel to one of his earlier regarded works must have been huge . Instead he concentrates on the understated psychological horrors of the predator and his prey in a slightly above average thriller . That said there is a twist involving self reference right at the very end which makes this above average thriller even more slightly above average","

I liked Unbreakable, but Signs was garbage and nearly everything else he has done has been rubbish (the Village has some merit).Now this was interesting, no question. James M was stunning in his performance (similar to Filth, a brilliant film).However, I was waiting for the pay off at the end of the movie. I assumed that the girl was either all 3 girls or the girl was just one of the personalities, that might have been a clever ending, but in the end, nothing; it just ended. Huh? What was the point of the uncle story? It added nothing. I thought it actually might have something to do with the whole story, but no, totally meaningless.I gave it a 1, as it lead nowhere and was a waste of time. The acting of the 2 main characters was brilliant, IMO, so deserved a higher score, but the writer and director deserves a minus 10, which balances it out.Complete crap!","

"Split","imdb-45","31 March 2017","So the first reviews here were which rated the film are obviously those connected with the film. The torrent of bad reviews that follows are the honest ones. From the start I had a bad feeling about this movie because the intro was so awkward and the dialogue was so cheesy with poor acting.James Macavoy is a very talented and versatile actor. How he was suckered into doing the latest Shyalaman stinker can only be explained by his needing to pay back a favor or someone having a terrible video of James with a farm animal. This film is that bad. The only moments that are somewhat tolerable are when Macavoy is on the screen. He's got by far the most presence and talent and the rest of the cast looks even worse contrasting his performance with theirs.In short, Macavoy plays a mentally ill person with multiple personalities. He kidnaps 2 girls with the assistance of a third who is terrified to act against his wishes, even when she has the ability to just walk away in a public airport. I mentioned this because that is how the film opens. You must buy into the premise in order for the film to even start to work.As the film progresses, it becomes evident early on that Macavoy suffers from this multiple personality disorder and will act out each part. And Shyalaman throws in his usual bit of supernatural rubbish, how such afflictions are also gifts, the savant mentality. OK, great, got it. Begin an hour of torture porn and hints of what bad things might happen. Warning that things will get worse. Heighten tension. Disclose things that don't really add up. Heighten tension. Add more awkward, obviously orchestrated dialogue and directing.Will the girls escape the potentially horrible ending they fear might happen? When will the James Macavoy acting clinic open? Will his accent change? Take Macavoy out of the film and this is a direct to video stinker that no one will remember. Sets a whole new bar of low.","

After that i had to keep jumping forward in order to find a scene that wasn't drawn out or meaningless...Needless to say i never found that scene.Acting was below average and dialog wasn't much better.Very disappointed in M. Knight in this one..I don't know how someone with his kind of talent let this one slide by.Look forward to watching more of his work in the future.I have loved his work in the past and hope for his sake this doesn't set him back in creating his next project.Until than ill just watch his other films and skip over Split!","

"Split","darkreignn","24 January 2017","""Split"" is a movie that will, no doubt, divide audiences. Advertised as a suspense thriller, what we get instead is a more nuanced and subtle film that touches on many uncomfortable topics in its first two acts, and then becomes clinically insane during its final third, but in the end left me unsatisfied. First of all, how was my man James McAvoy? Really good. Each personality that he played felt distinct and completely different from the other. Some personalities were kind and sympathetic, while others were downright menacing and oozed filth. There were even scenes where (slight SPOILER) McAvoy was playing a personality pretending to be a different personality, and as a whole his performance was brilliant. I'll be buying this film on Blu-Ray for the sole purpose of watching his acting again, and also for Anya Taylor-Joy. Not only is she the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life (seriously Anya if you're reading this feel free to send me a private message because I am single) but she plays a character, Casey Cooke, that has a level of depth and characterization that is unheard in modern day thrillers. She isn't just a pretty face who makes the worst possible decisions known to man, as is the norm in horror movies. She is actually a fully fleshed out character who has a past that affects her present and the choices she makes. She makes decisions that only make sense when you go home and think about the things her character went through. Things she says or does may not make complete sense until you stop and think about her characterization, and I loved that about the film. In fact, even though I didn't enjoy this film very much, I really want to go and watch it again to pick up on all the little details about her character that I missed, and this just adds replay value to the film. Anyaoustly, sorry I mean honestly, she is truly mesmerizing and has a very hypnotic quality to her that adds to the surreal and fantasy-like tone of the film. Also, the opening credits of this film were masterful. They teased a schizophrenic pace, maybe something akin to ""Inland Empire,"" and even thought that isn't exactly what we got, the opening credits were enthralling nevertheless. But with all these praises, what didn't I like about the film?First off, it felt unnecessarily sexual at times. For example, (slight SPOILES in this here paragraph) one of McAvoy's personalities has extreme OCD and freaks out at the slightest hint of uncleanliness. So, when one of the girls that he kidnaps gets dust on her shirt, he makes her take it off and she spends the rest of the film in her bra. Similarly, another girl gets dust on her skirt, and if you can't guess what happens next, let me tell you: she is forced to strip off her skirt and for the majority of the movie she is seen in her underwear. Now I get it, I realize that this was meant to convey how much of a weirdo this personality is, but was it really necessary to have two females shown half naked in order to do this? The answer is no. It wasn't a necessity, and in my opinion it cheapened the experience. I didn't need to see two frightened girls forced to take their clothes off to know that this specific McAvoy personality was evil; I got that when he kidnapped the three girls in the beginning of the movie. It was just so uncomfortable (which was the goal, I know) and unnecessary, and it almost felt like, instead of wanting to contribute toward good characterization, M. Night just wanted an excuse to get these girls naked, and it overall took me out of the movie. Another thing I didn't like about this film is that nothing feels resolved at the end, and as a whole the film feels unsatisfying and unhappy. Now, I don't need every film to have a happy ending, but when you have a likable and sympathetic character like Casey, a girl who goes through what is probably some of the most traumatic experiences anyone could ever go through, at least let her have a victory at the end. (SPOILERS) Instead, what we get is an ending where it is implied that Casey, after living in Hell since her early childhood, goes home to even more unspeakable atrocities. It's ""sad"", as in go home, curl into a ball, and cry for hours ""sad."" And maybe you'll like this ending, and that's fine, but for me, I didn't expect, or want, to feel suicidal walking home from the movie theatre. I'm not being funny either. I seriously felt dead on the inside for hours. And speaking of nothing being resolved at the end of this film, the ending (mild SPOILERS) of this movie is a blatant cliffhanger for a sequel that will tie up all the loose ends and complete the story. Look, I get it, sequels are popular, but if you're going to make a movie where the audience doesn't know there is going to be a sequel to, you better at least make it have a strong and satisfying conclusion, but in my opinion ""Split"" has neither. And this is irritating. A movie shouldn't have to rely on a sequel to be enjoyable, especially if the audience doesn't know it's going to be the first (or second) movie in a franchise. The story feels wide open at the end of the movie, which is so disappointing, as the trailer seemed to promise a tightly crafted story. ""Split"" is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. The acting, the directing, the production value, and the music are all great, and at times are truly masterful. However, the relentlessly bleak ending and unfinished feel of the film kept me from enjoying it.","

"Split","achmoye","7 April 2017","I think Shyamalan has been abducted by a multiple dissociative disorder guy, because I don't think he could have directed this crap. How come i can cry on some deep emotional movies, and How come i can feel NOTHING for Split ? How did he make this way to make me not care about any of these characters ? How did he fail that much, in his communication with the spectator ? The main actor is amazing but it doesn't matter. This is out-of-pace during 2 hours. Irrelevant flashbacks, general lack of rhythm and pacing of the action and emotional scenes. Actually this movie doesn't split anything, everything is faded the same way into this garbage aesthetic nonsense, so we have no idea whether to be scared or moved, but thats not the worst. The representation of dissociative disorder is cliché, childish, silly and ridiculous. Does he even know what is he talking about ? Cholesterol, really ? That is bio-lo-gical. Come on. Let me tell you something. I have known someone with these kinds of sickness. And that movie is a true disrespect to this medical condition. It's pure fantasy. Look it up, idk. Most of time they are NOT aware of their other personalities.Oh, and the girls and overly sexualized for no reason. pre-teens, laying down, running with no bra, are you kidding me ? is there a narrative justification ? And hunted by a wild beast ? Hell. I'm done, Jesus. What happened since Signs, sixth sense ? Is that Hollywood business bs ? Seems so.","

I've watched with high expectations, I was expecting a good thriller, full of twists and thrilling scenes like Don't Breathe (2016), but Split revealed to be the biggest disappointment of this year.The script is weak and full of holes, for example: the psychologist could have survived if she screamed the name that she wrote on the paper, the 3 kidnapped girls could attack the raptor and escape. In my opinion, it's not even a clever film, it turns out to be a fantasy/supernatural movie, the characters are uninteresting and don't create a connection with the viewer.The abducted girls are in better conditions than the viewers of this film, fortunately they didn't paid to see this crap.Rate: 1.5/10","

"Split","Leofwine_draca","23 July 2017","SPLIT is the latest movie from director M. Night Shyamalan, a director who, shall we say, has been delivering some disappointing results over the last fifteen years or so. Films like THE HAPPENING and THE LAST AIRBENDER have diluted his stock in Hollywood and made him a laughing stock in some circles, so it's a relief to see that he's getting back on track with SPLIT.Not that this is a perfect film; I found it one that takes a little while to build up steam although once it gets going it really hits home. The story is about a killer with multiple personalities and the best thing about it is James McAvoy who does a great job with a very difficult role. The rest of the cast aren't so impressive, and the script at times feels more than a little pretentious, but overall this is low key and impressive, building to some startling moments, and a definite step in the right direction for a one-time Hollywood great.","

"Split","imdb2-5","31 March 2017","It looks like India backs its Indian American director hero and has stuffed the ballot boxes here with high votes.What's sad is that M. Night's scripts are getting worse, if that is possible. I'll sum up this stinker in a nutshell. Crazy person with multiple personality disorders kidnaps 3 women for reasons that are unclear other than his being crazy. Then over the course of time you're told about how there really can be multiple people inhabiting the same body. And tales of the supernatural. And really, really, really bad and stupid dialogue. Victims acting stupidly as is needed for these films to work. And then of course the story of ""the beast"" within. Is it a really bad personality? Is it something else? Stay tuned while the pretty young ladies begin to slowly take off their clothing, which is par for the course for these films. There is very little reason to like any of the characters, which you don't get to know anyway. And some of the ""explanations"" are completely inconsistent with any type of logic or reason in the way people act.The only way I can understand Macavoy doing this film is someone stroking his ego about the tour de force performance it would require. And he does his usual excellent, intense job in trying to bring this stinker of a film to life as he plays about 2 different personalities that come off as prepared monologues that appear in random parts of the film. And it gets weirder and stupider as time marches along. Don't say you weren't warned.","

"Split","criscal","21 July 2021","I think if I had paid attention to the director's name at the beginning of the movie, I would probably have skipped it. The director started huge with his break through movie ""The Sixth Sense"" and then every movie became more lackluster. The last movie I watched with knowing that he had directed it was ""The Village"".Anyway, McAvoy is doing a superb job at acting out the different personalities of the villain - even if the director didn't trust it so much and had him put on different clothes for each of the characters. The other characters like the girl played by Anya Taylor-Joy and the therapist are played very well and intensely as well.The major gripe I have is with the premises of the story. The multiple personality disorder had more appearances in movies and TV shows than in actual reality - which was one case only as far as I know. That is why it is so controversial. The movie takes this further and puts the premise that different personalities come with biological differences e.g. Diabetes.I guess they picked McAvoy because of his role in ""Filth"".Anyway, would definitely not see it again.","

"Split","aqueerfailure","6 April 2017","A very nice horror/thriller. This ones takes on a story about a man with DID who abducts three girls. From this points , the movie twists and turn to finally get to the terrifying finale. It has got all the psychological and thriller elements but the standout performance from James Mcvoy is the one you will be terrified of. He portrays 23 personalities in one person of which on screen 5 are among main characters and share the most of screen time. To talk about plot , it seems similar but quickly turns out to be another thriller with it's own nice script and towards the end , it's not what you will expect. The films starts on a slow pace but once the setting is done , it moves forward with right pace creating suspense and only to become more terrifying. Especially a scene towards end will make you terrified of James Mcvoy for real. The fact that he and Anna Taylor Joy gave such outstanding performances makes it one of the best films. Sure , this will be a classic in the future among this genre.","

"Split","trnjamesbond","16 February 2017","Just by watching the trailer for Split, we all know what this film is about. You guessed it, yes that's right, it's multiple personality disorder. Written and directed by the not so famous anymore M. Night Shyamalan, starring James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Hayley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula and Izzie Coffey. The film takes us on the journey of the latest craze, girls taken, and then locked in basements against their will. It's sort of a sado masochism type of film in a way, except it's captor(McAvoy) has many personalities running around, all the while still under supervision of a psychologist.Shyamalan goes through all the predictable steps to make us care about the victims and the villain, we get a surprise ending as to why we have to sit and watch this predictable rubbish, and it's end is just to make the studios buy into Shyamalan's work yet another time, it's all about money to further his venture's for another feature film.Watching the entire film, and after seeing it's final scene, I felt annoyed, and I wouldn't watch this film again. It's the same stunt he pulled with ""Sixth Sense"", this type of ""oh wow"" would of worked 25 years ago, but not now, society is just too smart for this type of silliness. This director is very cocky in my opinion, he's had a few good movies, but mostly duds, while riding on the coat tails of his so called inspiration Alfred Hitchcock. Copying director style is one thing, but making films with Hitchcock step for step direction is another, that's why Shyamalan to me is a sell out, he's doing it for the money, we all fell for that rhetoric with SIxth Sense and Signs, but those day's are over, and there is more younger director talent out there, and it isn't Shyamalan.","

"Split","Movie_Muse_Reviews","27 April 2017","Few filmmakers have faced the scrutiny M. Night Shyamalan has endured in the nearly 20 years since ""The Sixth Sense"" became a global phenomenon and launched his memorable name into the spotlight. With each progressive film, it seemed Shyamalan drew more and more ire for his twist-focused approach to horror and by the late 2000s, nearly all his projects were panned. With ""Split,"" he appears to be on the rebound.Shyamalan's upswing actually began with a nice reception for 2015's ""The Visit,"" a return to horror after a foray into sci fi/fantasy (to no avail). ""Split"" builds on that momentum as a psychological thriller that walks a fine line between expert cinematic tension and unabashed lunacy. The film contains both that which has, at times, garnered Shyamalan much praise, and also that which has been the source of much derision. Creating a horror thriller based on an actual psychological condition – Dissociative Identity Disorder – immediately positions ""Split"" in dicey territory. It could quickly come across as exploiting a serious issue for the sake of entertainment. Shyamalan works around this as best he can by naming DID and devoting exposition to it in the form of Betty Buckley's character Dr. Karen Fletcher, the foremost expert on DID and a therapist with a longstanding relationship with Kevin (James McAvoy), who has 23 distinct personalities. Part of the mystery is that Fletcher senses something is off, that Kevin is hiding something. She is part of the story, not just a way for us to understand it. From a social responsibility perspective, this is a better approach than the 2003 film ""Identity,"" which was more exploitative of DID.Of course Kevin is hiding something, as in the film's opening, he kidnaps three teenage girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy). Casey, the outsider of the three girls, draws on memories from her troubled past to try and understand her unusual captor.Everything hinges on believing McAvoy's performance and the script's ability to set him up to be believed. Both flirt with disaster, like at any moment we might laugh at the entire production, but we end up buying it. McAvoy really commits to Kevin's many personalities, which Shyamalan wisely limits to a handful. There's a logic and sense of purpose behind which ones show up at which times. McAvoy owns them to the point that we actually see them as different characters when they're on screen.Yet it's the mystery of Kevin's intent and what he might be capable of that keeps things tense throughout most of the film, a tension that shifts from mystery-driven to horror-driven in the final act. At this point, ""Split"" becomes a much stranger movie and we're surprised at just where and how far Shyamalan will go. In narrative and thematic respects, however, ""Split"" doesn't quite pay off for all that it builds up. Piece by piece we get to know a lot about Cassie, for example, and enter her psychology, but her role in the story doesn't contribute anything revelatory. She's merely a more traditional protagonist to root for, another troubled mind to understand. The biggest ""twist"" is actually tied to this weaker component, and it kind of flies in the face of everything else that's happening in the movie tonally. Not enough to derail it, but enough to remind you of Shyamalan's challenges as a writer.Even worse for the film's tone, a post-credits revelation that Shyamalan throws into the movie has a souring effect on its ending. It seems entirely unnecessary and makes Shyamalan come off as self- aggrandizing – but that's about all that can be said spoiler-free. Ultimately, here's a filmmaker who is figuring out how to deliver the best version of the films he wants to make and he's getting closer.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Split","arabnikita","8 February 2017","All the politics aside, what a disastrous movie. The idea for this movie was very interesting and if executed properly would have been a great movie but it failed so badly. First, the movie had 5 main characters and 4 victims and in 2 hours they couldn't manage to develop a meaningful back-story for anyone of them. I could honestly careless if at the end he would have killed all of them. Second, what is with all the excessive nudity and makeup, things like this is what makes thriller/horror movies bad and cheap. I mean the tearing of clothes, undressing and the final scene where she just gets into an ambulance and already has fresh makeup on... unbelievable.Third, another ridiculous and meaningless ending.. just get it over with and end everyone's torture.Finally, in America where every little pathetic thing involves child services, this 17 year old girl has gone her whole life being abused and didn't say anything... unbelievable.Props to James McAvoy for good acting but it still couldn't save this train wreck of a movie.","

"Split","secondtake","4 August 2017","Split (2016)An interesting movie with some ""dumb"" aspects, like many horror films. The good part is how we see the villain (with multiple personalities) is slowly revealed through videos and a therapist. It's unlikely, of course, but actor James McAvoy makes it vivid and fun. And believable in the movie.The three teenage girls are made to be mostly clichés (one of them much less so) and in case you are wondering, yes, they end up miserable and in their underwear by the end of the movie. This is a horrible shame because it cheapens the whole thing, and the complexity of the McAvoy's character makes it unnecessary. I'm also tired of movies where innocent females are imprisoned by crazy men, with all the ugly power trips and sexual fear involved.There are some slightly superhuman aspects that get revealed (I think writer/director Shyamalan probably thought this was ""really cool"" and if you wonder about him, go see some interviews on youtube). It's fun, of course, but to me not the brilliant inventive movie some others have said. If you know any of Shyamalan's other films, you might quickly characterize this one as a lesser one (like ""The Village"") and by that you'll know that there are some really fluid, beautiful aspects to the movie, and some conceptual flaws that get in the way. But still enjoyable entertainment, so weight it accordingly.","

"Split","sossevarvo","12 January 2017","Shyamalan's inconsistencies as a director are decidedly ignominious. He  spellbound us with The Sixth Sense, but soon after befuddled with lady  in the Water, provoked derisive jeers with The Happening, and merely  bored us with The Last Airbender and After Earth. The pared back horror  of The Visit signalled a renaissance for the auteur, with its genuinely  frightening aesthetic, and even a decent Shyamalan twist!   But, armed with what seems to be a more significant budget, and far  more loopy creative ambition, Split is Shyamalan's true calling card to  what hopefully is a far more fortuitous run of features. Using the  disorder of DID, and a true story (!), to create its bonkers premise,  McAvoy plays Kevin, a man who possesses 23 distinct personalities, some  of which are male and some of which are female, some of which are  young, and some of which are old, some of which are homosexual and some  of which are heterosexual, some of which have OCD or require insulin  for diabetes, and some of which are really rather volatile and  dangerous. The catch? The 24th is about to arrive, with all hell set to  break loose.   If this sounds like an actor's dream job, you're right. With the  opportunity to flex his acting muscles to the nth degree,  all-accent-changing, mannerism-altering McAvoy rises to the challenge  with a performance of breathtaking versatility. The film around him is  never quite as reliable as this towering performance, however. The plot  functions between an incredibly tense kidnapping/hostage situation and  a doctor who purports to be an expert of DID. While eventually serving  a narrative purpose, in the early scenes, Shyamalan's switching to this  doctor's narrative grinds the movie to something of a halt, leaving you  longing for the far more interesting story to develop and ultimately  resolve. That being said, the movie never bores for a second, thanks to  Shyamalan's distinctive style and an ominous score, as well as Anya  Taylor Joy, so impressive in The Witch, who proves she isn't a one  trick pony. In addition, like THe Visit, Split is, unexpectedly, quite  funny, in a way that never sacrifices tension, but rather serves to  enhance it by catching you off guard with scares when you're recovering  from a bizarre joke - it's a terrific tactic that serves the film well.  Most worthy of recommendation is the film's third act, which evolves  into something genuinely terrifying and ferociously tense, as twist  upon twist piles up to create a thrilling sense of chaos and dread.  Less convincing are Shyamalan's repeated attempts at motifs of beasts  and animals, which feel shoehorned in and unnecessary. Despite al this,  Split is a worthy work from Shyamalan that will deliver a jolt of high  octane thrills to your nerves, one which will certainly be needed in  the doldrums of the January dumping ground of films.","

"Split","starving_college_student","25 January 2019","The storytelling is cliche, the idea/view of multiple personalities is dated, there really is no progressing story, and the 'thrills' aren't really scary/thrilling. The script of Split feels like a first draft, missing a few basic elements. Like usually in this kind of serial-killer kind of thriller, it starts off with a grisly murder, which shows what the bad guy is capable of and what the protaganist wants to avoid. Here we have nothing, not knowing why Kevin even wants the girls. This fizzles a lot of tension/horror. From there no real plot develops (no one looking for the girls) and an unconnected sideplot with the therapist doesn't push things along (and the flashbacks of the lead girl really don't add anything to her character or story either). Split then tries to do the typical Shyamalan twist, but there was no story/red herring to make the twist surprising. Like in the Sixth Sense, the movie was setup as a story about helping a kid who sees ghosts, until the inevitable twist that showed what the movie was really about. Here, with out that element, all you have is a campy origin story for a super villain whose only purpose is to setup for another movie (the next Unbreakable). The only saving grace to this film, and only reason to see it, is McAvoy. His performances are rivetting. Each character is unique and very watchable. I'm not sure it's enough reason to watch this film, however.","

"Split","troy-daniel-bush","9 January 2021","Unpopular opinion, I think it's better than Signs. While I think Signs has plenty of redeeming qualities I think it has too many big problems going against it. (I've reviewed it already.) Don't get me wrong this movie has some big problems of its own, but we will get to those later.The movie is very well shot. Mike Gioulakis is a cinematographer to keep your eyes on, right up there with Roger Deakins. The shots were nicely framed and they had a slow, creeping movement to them and that really brought out the tension in the movie.The score also did a great job at bringing out the tension, as well as setting the tone. I especially love the song during the opening credits. And the opening credits themselves were pretty creepy.There were moments in this movie that were very disturbing. Disturbing to the point where you think, ""Most directors wouldn't show this."" Bravo, Shyamalan.There were a few subtleties in the movie. My favorite would have to be when Dr. Fletcher writes Kevin wendell Crumb on the piece of paper. Or when Casey hesitates to answer the police officer's question.Anya Taylor Joy did a really good job and her character had a good amount of depth. The decisions that she makes in the film make a lot of sense.Betty Buckley was pretty good. You could tell that she was doing the best she could with the dialogue she was given.And let's talk about the very best thing in this movie! Do I even have to say what it is? Let's just say that this movie would've crashed and burned if they had picked a less talented actor. He is truly one of the best actors in the world today. Even if he picks a bad movie he's still phenomenal.Now for what this movie did not do well:The other two main actresses were bad. I was happy when they got separated and put in two different rooms.There is quite a bit of dialogue that is not natural at all. It's not Last Airbender level terrible; you can tolerate it, but you can't help but be like ""No one talks like that."" And there are lines that were very unnecessary.There are a number of holes in the narrative. Like why didn't he separate the girls in the first place? Or why would he try to kidnap those girls in broad daylight? And why would he take them all at once instead of one at a time?I also have to wonder why Dennis didn't notice Casey in the car at first.So yeah, I do enjoy this movie and I find myself revisiting it every now and again. It's by no means as good as The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but it's certainly better than most of Night's filmography. (What happened, dude?) Something I should probably mention since it occurs to me that not a lot of people know this: Shyamalan wrote the script to this movie back when he was still making good movies. So anyone who said that he had returned to form with this movie, myself included, was very incorrect. Which explains why Glass was such an insufferable piece of crap.","

"Split","CIDMoosa","7 June 2018","12 years back at Sreekumar theatre Trivandrum , I was going berserk over Chiyaan Vikram's multiple personality magnum opus Anniyan - and all of a sudden James McAvoy has outweighed that very specific standard of enactment with his once in a life time role in Split. Manoj Nelliate Shyamalan, that Indian prodigy who made sixth sense and sunk into oblivion with a chain of duds subsequently has made a magnificent riposte! Split sees the prolongation of Shyamalan's assignation with the supernatural but also a long anticipated rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to rematerialize. The film deals majorly with a person sustaining 23 different personalities within himself of which a 24th one is about to surface. Resting heavily on the lead actor who has done a magnificent job, the screenplay sways between his distinctive dispositions, transitioning from an OCD patient to a psycho woman and to a 9 year old boy, amongst 18 other manifestations. 3 girls are abducted by one of these personas and made to wait for the appearance of the last one before they should try and escape him. Living up to his expectations, Shyamalan has created a proficiently hewed psychological thriller which is darkly amusing. Very much commended for an exhilarating watch..","

"Split","max1174","18 November 2016","A welcome return to form for the director and James McEvoy gives one of his finest performances. I am not sure how many actors could achieve what he has executed so well here and one wonders if the film could have worked at the highest level without him. In between some of his bigger studio choices he has chosen challenging or interesting roles no matter how the films turn out and his range and talent always keep surprising but he takes it to another level here. I won't reveal too much about the film as others will do that, except to say it was a great film to watch in the theater, full of suspense and in some ways quite touching and meaningful, even if you do or don't like the final twists you'll be drawn in to this story and on the edge of your seat in more of a suspense mode. I wasn't sure if the film would go beyond a typical kidnapping film in the first five minutes but I can assure you its completely different to any expectations you'll have despite the director putting some of his more traditional touches on the film towards the end of it which really work in this case. I've always liked his earlier films as they often look at human conditions or flaws with imagination and some of his films have fallen short but he sounds like he's become more open minded and enjoying his work returning to form so well here and all I can say is well done, he has great attention to detail and gives his all. This is a great film if you want an original suspense/thriller go and see it. I was sorry to see a review that put this film down, those reviews are off the mark this time round in my opinion I hope there is more to come from the M Night daring to be different again, his lower budget work is outstanding and easily brings out his best storytelling. James McEvoy you've smashed it here and given you're all it was worth the risk, keep taking them! Having attended the Q&A he comes across a decent humble man which I would think gives his performances such resonance and skill. Also a great performance from Anya Taylor Joy she's a talent as well. Go see the see the film, especially in the threatre on a big screen it will have you on the edge of your seat.","

Well, the promotion and the trailer seemed promising, and it turned out to be overrated, because the movie is so boring. Kinda disappointed with James's acting, i believed he did his best for the role, yet i didn't think i could feel all the personalities he represented. He was a great actor, I knew he could do so better than this movie.As for the movie itself, it was very typical and predictable. It wouldn't scare you psychologically (i think it's what psychological thriller means, right?""). Anyway, these different personalities knew each other. Except for the real personality, Kevin Wendell Crumb, didn't realize that he had a dissociative identity disorder (i thought he knew after his therapist told him?). Kevin only knew he had a passed out period time, when his other personalities took over. Unfortunately, Dennis, the vicious personality who kidnapped the girl knew that all could happen as your brain made it to be. So he created the 24th personality, called the Beast, and he could call out the Beast whenever he wanted. All i can say is, great idea is poorly executed. So just don't waste your time. This movie is not what they've told you.","

Gripping, dark and psychological meandering. The story line is not all out scary; is not supernatural really; but haunting with scattered anxiety. Three young women are kidnapped and held captive by a man suffering with his agonizing 23 different personalities that may even hint toward a 24th. These attractive girls must play their own mind games to find what personality will be of any help in their escape.James McAvoy is outstanding weaving the different personalities. And Anya Taylor-Joy is the stronger of the captives. Very disturbing thematic content with violent behavior. Also in the cast: Haley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula, Betty Buckley and a cameo by Shyamalan.Worth a repeat watch with some friends.","

"Split","adamjohns-42575","13 July 2022","Split (2016) -It is weird to have a slight crush on James McAvoy in this film, playing someone with 23 different people inside his head, but I do. There are very few occasions when you get to see them being an everyday person, but there is a slightly sexual component to things that makes him appealing, but maybe that's just me.The everyday people aren't the interesting personalities of course, so you don't see them much at all, except for a fantastic montage type part where some are shown in more detail via recorded video messages, which I think is a smart way to explore them.James was absolutely superb though and I cannot believe that the Oscars wouldn't even touch this film, because of it's subject matter and that Mr McAvoy didn't clean up all of the awards everywhere. It takes a lot to impress me, but this really was a phenomenal performance on his part.How did he do it? I mean there are times when they flip from one personality to the next almost instantaneously. That must have taken some rehearsing.And it's also very odd when you think just a year before that he also made 'Victor Frankenstein' (2015), which was dreadful.The story is very clever and interesting, especially when you consider that it is based on a real person. I can only imagine how hard it would be to live like Kevin (Person 1) does. I'm actually trying to avoid referring to myself as we, when I have conversations in my head, for fear of releasing another person hidden deep inside. The one I've already got is bad enough and my other person would end up being Patricia, I just know it!It's an intelligent story, well thought out and researched. Some say that it has had a detrimental or misrepresented effect on people that suffer with Dissociative Identity Disorder (D. I. D.) and the causes that support them, but I for one feel educated by it and fascinated by the possibilities of the human brain as a result.I can see that people with only pleasant multiple personalities may feel misrepresented, but that's not the point of this particular story. I'm sure a film about a more everyday case of D. I. D. To show the other side of the coin would be just as interesting if someone made it as a comparison.This film though, is a little bit crazy and horrifying in its subject matter and really intense, but somewhat compelling to watch even as someone who hates horror and psychological films.I could easily make comparisons to 'Whiplash' (2014), 'A Clockwork Orange' (1971), 'The Departed' (2006) and '12 Years A Slave' (2013) in the respect that those films are really not to my standard tastes, but so well executed that the things that upset me personally, because I'm a wimp, are not enough to score them low. They are what really good film making is all about and so is 'Split'.The whole production and James' characters are excellent and I couldn't help but appreciate that.""I have blue socks too!""897.55/1000.","

"Split","candelach","17 February 2017","This film and its ludicrous portrayal of Dissociative Identity Disorder sets back the progress we have made in the past years to end the stigmatization of mental illness. I am in no way of the belief that films should never be problematic but if you are going to go somewhere like this, there should be a reason for it. If you want to provoke, please do so but not just for the sake of profit. There was literally no need whatsoever for this film. The ""bad guys"" with the multiple personalities have all been covered in the 1960s-80s. Why go there now? Why take a backlash and put hundreds of people with this illness at risk for further discrimination?","

"Split","classicsoncall","17 January 2019","I'm probably like a lot of the viewers for M. Night Shyamalan's films, in that I felt his best efforts, ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", came early in his career and he's struggled to match the intensity and credibility of those pictures. ""Split"", I think, gets him back on the right track with a psychological thriller that contains elements of horror, not so much for what you see on screen, but what your imagination suggests might be terrifying. I thought James McAvoy did a commendable job in a role calling for a split personality with multiple characters. I also thought the picture cleverly included a back story for the character of Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), who was able to relate to the 'Hedwig' portion of Kevin Wendell's (McAvoy) psyche by virtue of being an abuse victim herself. The only thing I get frustrated about in stories like this is when the main protagonist is outnumbered, and the 'victims' can't or won't come to an understanding that they could take him out if they joined forces. Now maybe the 'Barry' facet of Wendell's alter-ego might have been too strong to overcome, but the 'Dennis' or 'Patricia' personalities might have succumbed to a three on one attack. Easy enough for me to say because I've never been in that position, and each of the kidnapped girls individually were too traumatized to take direct action initially. Then once they were separated, the 'gang up' option went away. The final scene of Bruce Willis reprising his character David Dunn from ""Unbreakable"" was a neat way to whet the appetite of Shyamalan fans who would never have expected a follow up to that earlier film, and I for one will be on hand to see if ""Glass"" restores some of the magic of that masterful film. My only other comment is reserved for Betty Buckley portraying the sympathetic psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher, who's painstaking patience in attempting to reconcile Wendell's twenty three personalities ultimately ended in tragedy. Wisely, the story didn't try to account for all of them, and in Dr. Fletcher's case, it appeared that eight was enough.","

"Split","Sammy_Sam_Sam","16 January 2017","I'm going to start this review by stating that this isn't a particularly original film - there are already quite a few out there which do the same thing, only far better. Only last week I watched 10 Cloverfield Lane, which is broadly similar, yet a far superior movie. The reason 10 Cloverfield works (the final 10-15 minutes aside) is that you always feel John Goodman's character could lose it at any moment. And from time-to-time, he does. That movie really had me on edge and the tension was almost unbearable at times. Unfortunately, 'Split' did not do this well. The runtime and pacing is probably one of the biggest issues, because a movie like this set over 117 minutes really needs to be handled by a master. I don't know much about this director, but he's no Kubrick. And although Kubrick could be self-indulgent (Eyes Wide Shut was a catastrophe), a film like The Shining runs for well over 2 hours, but the suspense and atmosphere carries it all the way. With Split, the film lulls and drags you really don't believe you're going to see this 'beast' they talk about till the very end, which is a big problem, because you're not on the edge of your seat. Perhaps sharper editing would help and personally I would've cut it down substantially, but that still wouldn't have made it a great movie.McAvoy gives a decent performance, but I'm not about to overstate it. I saw a film called 'The Love Butcher' the other day and the almost unknown actor in that film also played many characters quite successfully. Lots of actors are capable of this and I'm sure many will cite McAvoy's performance as being a key element of the film, but for me it doesn't save the movie. If you want campy fun of this sort, check out John Lithgow in Brian De Palma's Raising Cain! Other acting in the film is absolutely fine, although you don't get to see two of the girls all that much. This again is another problem, because this sort of film really works best when you can put yourself in the place of the victim(s). It doesn't really dare you to do that, as it moves from place to place, but doesn't focus on their plight.There's a huge plot hole something which one of the characters should have said near the end of the movie, but I won't elaborate, as I don't want to spoilt it. It's a glaring plot hole though! To conclude, it really does drag so much and I couldn't wait for it to end. It gets to the point where you know everything there is to know, but it won't stop. We're just treated to more 'performance' from McAvoy, but by this point, you won't care. I could recommend at least a dozen similar films without a second thought which are far better than this, so I honestly wouldn't waste your time. There were a few laughs along the way, but by the end of the film, you certainly won't be laughing. Overall, for me it's a 4/10.","

"Split","BA_Harrison","17 January 2019","M. Night Shyamalan's Split is essentially one long 'set-up' movie, introducing us to the many personalities of disassociative identity disorder patient Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), as well as teen-in peril Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), both of whom play a part in the director's forthcoming Unbreakable sequel Glass.As such, the film feels a little inconclusive, but still manages to be fully engrossing thanks to a standout performance from McAvoy, who brilliantly handles his character's many personalities, and a likeable turn from Taylor-Joy, who plays one of three teenage girls abducted by Crumb as food for his burgeoning twenty-fourth identity, the Beast.The film is a bit head-scratching at times, but Shyamalan pulls it all together nicely for a rousing finale, and tops it off with a surprising end credits scene guaranteed to leave fans of Unbreakable champing at the bit for the next instalment in what is becoming a delightfully unorthodox superhero series.","

"Split","hitchcockthelegend","2 February 2019","Split is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley, Haley Lu-Richardson and Jessica Sula. Music is by West Dylan Thordson and cinematography by Mike Gioulakis.Three girls are kidnapped by a man with a diagnosed 23 different personalities. They must try to escape before the apparent emergence of the 24th - known as The Beast...We now know that Split is the second instalment of a trilogy by Shyamalan that began with Unbreakable and is ending with Glass (released 2019). Always proving to be a most divisive director/writer/actor, Shyamalan has returned to the sort of noticeable form that had him earmarked in his early days as a director to follow - with the proviso that inevitably this is going to still infuriate some for its handling of the subjects at hand.The plot trajectory is simple enough, girls kidnapped by a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder, as the girls in fear try to escape, a number of his personalities put in an appearance. Which builds up to the finale, which explodes after following on from the suspense and dread atmospherics so beloved by the director. In the mix joining the mental health issue with our main protagonist is a good meaning doctor (naturally), and the spectre of child abuse rears its ugly head. So not a movie to be cheered up by then! While if looking for a detailed and attentive look at the mental health issues to hand you will be disappointed.However, there is a style to the picture in how it draws you into the predicament of the main players, boosted no end by McAvoy on irresistible form. Given licence to chew every scene, he delivers his various characters with great relish and no little amount of skill. Props to for Taylor-Joy, who as the lead kidnappee has deftly blended youthful innocence with resourceful strength (aided by Shyamalan's writing of course). Conversely, Shyamalan is guilty of just making a pic for entertainment purpose, which works as it's a very good creepy thriller with its black humour moments, but the mental health plot devices ensure his gimmicks will not be welcomed by all. 7/10","

"Split","ediesedgwick-46930","14 June 2017","firstly, i have to compare this movie to La La Land, because this is what is considered Oscar material and Oscar performances in 2017. If La La Land was an Oscar movie, this is effin' citizen kane. Loved the bruce willis cameo and that there is a cinematic universe somewhere between all those uneven films. This film delivers. It has an amazing performance and realistic characters in a surreal nearly sci-fi but engaging plot. There is no twist end. Not really. There is a bitter end this time. One that stays with you for a while after the movie ends. There is a desperation where there was once a ray of light in the ending. The film is occasionally funny and aware of it and is not easily categorized. It is a subtle commentary on many many things, violence, abuse, human nature, relationships, sexism, modern society, the potential of a human being, racism, the idiocy of the average people, our traumas, madness, the virtue of patience, existential angst etc It is true that it is a horror movie about a sick person, which may not be politically correct but is a very old and common trope in horror flicks. It is also true that this film turns the trope on its back, presenting us a charming psychopath. He does unspeakable things, but he is not evil, he is beyond morality and he has an ambivalent point of view. The movie doesn't take sides. Murder is not a taboo in this narration, it may be an act of God or some creature close to him. The characters that surround the protagonist are also flawed in many ways and not very likable (with a couple of exceptions). There are obvious (and delightful) references to Psycho and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. One thing is certain. This movie is not for people who always had it easy...","

"Split","ironhorse_iv","12 February 2017","After emerging in the 1990s and early 2000s as one of the top horror directors thanks to films like 1999's 'The Sixth Sense' and 2000's 'Unbreakable', it's no secret that M. Night Shyamalan's career began to experience an unfortunate downward spiral starting with 2002's 'Signs' leading up to the truly irredeemable 2008's 'The Happening'. Even when he try to film, other genre like 2010's 'The Last Airbender' & 2013's 'After Earth', he continue to fail to connect with his audience. However, in 2015, it all change as he return to form with 'The Visit'. That movie became a surprise hit with critics and horror fans. It even show the first signs of a possible comeback. With that reconnected with his audience, Shyamalan released his newest stylish psychological thriller 'Split' about three girls: Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor Joy) being kidnapped by a mysterious man (James McAvoy) whom been diagnosed 23 distinct personalities; as they must try to escape before the man's deadly 24 persona takes hold. Like 'The Visit', a few years earlier, 'Split' mostly received generally positive reviews from both audiences and critics. For me, personally, I thought it was one of his very best written film yet, even if two of the three victims are thinly-thought of. At least, the third, Casey, is given a semblance of multidimensionality via a series of flashbacks that plays a big part in the climax of the film. Anya Taylor Joy does a great job, showing us, the quiet and raw emotion that not many other actresses her age are capable of. We wanted to see her, survive against the mental disturb man. The movie did portray a very good, Hitchcockism 'Psycho' mysterious-like vibe with the mysterious villain, ranging from the OCD neat freak, to an innocent child-like being to a creepy motherly figure. Mad props goes to James McAvoy for making a haunting man with 23 personalities seem somewhat real, even if we only see 7th of them. Still, I like how each one of them, has its own strengths, physical traits and flaws. I also like how each one has with its own unique ways of managing Kevin's fears and protecting him from the world around him. It also amazing to see some of the personas impersonates others, during the explosion dumps scenes, such as the ones, he has, with psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Nearly every dialogue having some subtle mysterious purpose, foreshadowing to what is to come. While, some people still hate the movie for how it portrayed, dissociative identity disorder. In my opinion, the psychological aspects of dissociative identity disorder are presented accurately to how they appear in medical literature with diagnosis often being difficult, as there is considerable comorbidity with other mental disorders, and malingering often happens. While, it's true that most people suffering from 'DID', are more of a danger to themselves, than to other people. I do have to say, there are 'DID"" people like this, who trick and hide the pain from others. Even with cameo of Shyamalan, these scenes, along with Mike Gioulakis's cinematography with the sinister, windowless, underground lair, smoothly snaking with corridors, dingy doors and pipes, and harsh pools of light, adds to the suspense that already full of physical dangers to the girls, whom trying to escape through structural weaknesses or trying outsmart their deranged captor. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game of epic, psychological proportions, packed to the brim with a few surprises and more than a few unexpected twists and turns. One of them, like the supernatural powers might seem a little too out of this world, but it does come from real-world theories about the elastic limits of human possibility. While the supernatural subplot seem to come out of nowhere for the viewer that wasn't paying attention. There were some great subtle foreshadowing of that, within the movie. A good example is the scene where one of the persona has to take insulin shots. Who knows, if that was for the diabetes or to help with having extreme abilities like super strength like a shot of steroids!? Another, would be the sight of the mysterious man, mourning his father, disappearance at the train station. Could his father, be one of the victims of Eastrail 177 crash!? All of this, could be, possible, as the film concept for this flick was originally written for a different, previous movie of Shyamalan. So, don't be, too surprised of the twist, toward the end, at the diner. Overall: I will say that if you're a stickler for realism, you might want to save yourself the frustration. While not perfect, with the help of his actors and technical crew, Shyamalan has created a film that feels less like a standard horror kidnapping tale, and more like a legitimately moving story about self-discovery. This is a smart movie that will undoubtedly leave viewers thinking -- and discussing. If you have enjoyed any of M. Night's smart movie before, then there is a good chance you will enjoy this horror flick. Highly recommended.","

"Split","ericrnolan","8 April 2017","For much of its running length, I was considering writing a review for ""Split"" (2016) that rated it a perfect 10. (I am an unabashed fan of M. Night Shyamalan, no matter how reviled he is by other Internet commentators.) I love the way he frames his shots, I love his dialogue, I love his stories, and I love the strange way he can make a slowly paced film nevertheless absorbing.)And ""Split"" looked nearly perfect. James McAvoy handed in a tour- de-force performance as Kevin, a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID). (Yes, I am aware of the clinical controversies connected with whether the disorder even exists — I was a psychology student many, many years ago. I think we should suspend whatever disbelief we have for the purposes of enjoying the movie.) McAvoy plays his role to perfection. His ""Dennis"" persona is particularly frightening, and ""Barry,"" one of the ""good personalities"" he portrays, is surprisingly endearing and sympathetic.Playing off McAvoy wonderfully are Betty Buckley as his gentle psychiatrist and Anya Taylor-Joy as one of three teenaged girls kidnapped by his nastier personalities. The talented Taylor-Joy was also perfect in her role. (I last saw her 2015's ""The Witch"" and she was also in last year's ""Morgan;"" I'm gaining the impression that this promising young specializes in cerebral horror-thrillers.)I would rate ""Split"" an 8 out of 10. It suffers a bit, I think, from two missteps toward the end. One, this taut psychological thriller takes an ill-advised turn into dark fantasy. I thought it was amazingly good as a thriller grounded only in the real world — it was far less so with the later jarring story elements. (I do realize why Shyamalan made this creative decision, and you will too, after watching it and then reading up on it.) But I still think that this would have been a perfect film if the majority of it focused on McAvoy's personalities either aiding or misleading his psychiatrist, with Taylor-Joy's fate hanging in the balance.Two, this film seemed to suffer from the too-many-endings syndrome that people often associate with Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. We seem to have one denouement that works quite well, then a second that should have been re-shot and re-scripted. And then there's another plot strand finally addressed  but it is played so subtly that I'm not even sure I got it. And this isn't even counting the significance of the movie's final line, which works as a fantastic framing device.About that line  if you're a Shyamalan fan, then you simply must watch the film until it's very end, as the camera pans through the coffee shop. You'll love it.","

What the movie shows is not a individual's mental illness, but what human mind is or can be capable of. The power hidden as explained in the iceberg theory, the not wandered territory of human potential, in turn manifesting into good and bad. Great actors and great delivery.

"Split","acinemafan","27 April 2017","Sadly, the big weakness of this movie is James McAvoy. He's a good actor, but this movie tested -- and went beyond his skills. He looks like he's performing in ""Split"" -- even looking like he's in an acting class, projecting different personalities. It may be an odd comparison at first glance, but his many scenes can be compared to Brando in ""Apocalypse Now,"" with the focus directly on him and how he emotes. And McAvoy just comes up short. For me, he just didn't hold my interest.And then there's the loose end of the one heroine. Very odd back story pertaining to her, that has no closure. Quite dissatisfying. Now, one may argue that her story is realistic, but that realism is incongruent with the main story. It's a side story that just doesn't fit.Disappointed.With all that being said, if you find McAvoy fun/intriguing to watch, you may love the movie. It relies almost completely on his performance.!!BIG SPOILER!! As the story played out, and knowing that twists are Shyamalan are his signature move, I thought we'd see that the villain was a certain character's son from a previous Shyamalan film.

Kevin (James McAvoy) So warns one of a couple dozen personalities played by a game and convincing McAvoy, whose 23 Dissociative-Identity-Disorder (DID) central characters people the messy Split. Director/writer M. Night Shyamalan has crafted an abduction thriller cum multiple personality disorder with his signature twisted ending, but overall not near the greatness of The Sixth Sense, Signs, or even the more recent The Visit.Three teens are abducted by Kevin et al., whose promise that a ""Beast"" is coming to devour them does spook the bejesus out of them. The more canny of the three, Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy from the surprisingly effective The Witch), is the heroine destined to grapple with that Beast and the personalities that wander around this bunker-like world (Remember the locale of 10 Cloverfield Lane?) The director directs way too many close-ups of her for my taste, and the usual horror tropes like jump scares aren't sufficient to mask a fragmented plot that mirrors the split personality disorders. Outside forces like the kindly shrink, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), are actually peripheral to the power of Dennis and his army of identities.Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill used a split personality motif to explain bad behavior; Hitchcock, a big influence on De Palma and Shyamalan, used most of Split's bag of tricks, especially in Psycho, long before Shyamalan knew what personality was; United States of Tara showcased for TV the DID state to some notable success. Split will not meet the ""classic"" criteria they have achieved.Because payoff for Shyamalan has always been the twist ending, he doesn't so much disappoint as confuse, with unfortunate explanations that sap the challenges a smart thriller should offer.""I've never seen a case like this before. Twenty three identities live in Kevin's body."" Dr. Fletcher","

"Split","Giacomo_De_Bello","29 January 2017","When three girls are kidnapped by a man (James McAvoy) with 24 different personalities they have work out which of those personalities will help them escape and which of those personalities will will try to stop them. Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), a teen with a troubled past, seems to be the only one who might just actually be able to understand and communicate with the madman.With a premise so wild and fascinating it is hard not to be hooked when you go into the theater. Coming out I can't help but call myself disappointed in a film that has as much potential as wasted one, thrown away in a structure that can't keep focus of what it's doing.Even with that, there is still quite something to be appreciated here. Firstly, it is hard not to be wowed by Shyamalan's mastery in technique. He clearly demonstrates being comfortable in the medium and plays with the audience in several different ways. From the little touches in insert shots to the big, big set-piece shots he always adds something special and uncanny to them. Be it twenty three different toothbrushes or a single closing shot on a lock, his images have something to really sink in and love about them and he is a master in the use of focus to build tension or character conflict.Then McAvoy as always is in solid acting territory and gives an intense performance, you can see the work he put into this oozing from the screen. The way he switches from a personality to the other is brilliant, you see a change in his face and posture and it makes it incredibly special. Moreover the work he puts in physically pays off, it reads on screen powerfully and makes the difference for the whole film. Surprising is how well Anya Taylor Joy manages to keep up with him delivering an equally functional performance.Where the film really looses its charm for me is in its script. Unfortunately it is highly unfocused and does not know where to go or what to do with the compelling premise, indicative of this is the final twist which I barely managed to grasp.There is no order in how the story evolves, we give the main character an extensive backstory in flashbacks and that leads nowhere, there is a mystery with the relationship between Kevin and his psychiatrist and that leads to nothing too, then there is the main conflict in the kidnapping story that leads us nowhere once again, with possibly the worst resolution of all of the above. And then, at the center of this, is the character of McAvoy, who is as fascinating on paper as he is chaotic on screen.There is no silver lining with this character, there is no pay off, no purpose to his story, he is simply a gimmick. Consider too the fact that of the supposed 23 personalities we only see seven or eight on screen which makes for a hugely underwhelming experience. Moreover, when you consider the fact that of the ones we see there are only a couple that get any development you understand what a bloated journey the view is carried through.Which is exactly the way I would define the film, a ride that doesn't really have any idea where it is going, but has its moments of inspiration during the trip.","

Night Shyamalan had gotten, I must admit that I was looking forward to getting to watch it and was hoping that this would indeed be a step up from the usual messy movies that he directs.And while ""Split"" starts out great enough, it quickly becomes apparent that this is just yet another story befuddled by his directorial skills. Sure, the movie had some great moments, but the storyline was just too predictable, and when the main character started to climb on the wall and ceiling I was just about ready to turn off the movie and find something else to watch.It should be said that this movie is watchable and enjoyable only because of the interesting and diverse performance that James McAvoy puts on as he portrays multiple personalities trapped within the same body.""Split"" is about as predictable as they come, and you got it figured out not way too far into the movie, and the storyline was suffering from that face, as if being relatively weak in storyline wasn't enough.All in all, James McAvoy carries this movie and makes it worth watching. However, ""Split"" is not an oustanding movie from director M. Night Shyamalan. The movie does have fans, that much is clear from the high rating. However, personally, I found it to be just a mediocre movie, and I wasn't impressed with it aside from James McAvoy.","

"Split","taylorhammons","28 January 2017","I don't know why I continue to expect greatness from this director. The Sixth Sense was phenomenal. Unbreakable and Signs were good. But after that, Shyamalan has let us down time and time again. The Visit was at least marginally better than anything we'd seen from him in years, so I came into Split expecting a comparable level of decency- something to further cement my theory that Shyamalan was making a comeback. Instead, I was met with a disjointed story that tried to draw unnecessary parallels between its heroes and villains. The two other girls seem important but turn out to be useless and dispensable. While McAvoy portrayed a convincing crazy person, his performance could not make up for the bad screen writing, nonsensical plot, and awful character development. To top it off, the ending made no sense and seemed it was supposed to be reminiscent of The Village. And, while the ending of The Village was stupid, the buildup was well timed and it was possible to see it coming. Split seemed to have failed in the one and only area where the Village succeeded- well timed plot twist. By the time Split got around to revealing the plot twist, we had stopped caring. It wasn't scary. It wasn't entertaining. It just didn't make sense.","

"Split","pyrocitor","5 July 2017","It's tempting to read the title of director M. Night Shyamalan's latest thriller as a cruelly reflexive play on the schism of his infamous filmmaking career: part I (the Early Days, where he was heralded as one of the industry's most visionary living directors), and part II (a slew of exponential misfires so inexplicably ill-advised no one, most likely including Shyamalan himself, quite knew what was Happening). Sadly, although Split does recall Shyamalan's early glory days (literally - to an almost inexcusably tacky fashion), there are mere hints of promise and potential here, skulking like phantoms amongst a film too mired in silliness and indecisive murk to leave too much of a mark. This isn't to say Split is a total write-off - there are trashy thrills to be had, and pitted against the bulk of Shyamalan's last decade of work, it's practically Citizen Kane. Still, it bears the melancholy mark of a fallen maverick who hasn't so much reclaimed his mojo as located the postal code it relocated to. If anything, Shyamalan is wise to play it safe, steering clear of sci-fi, fantasy, and airbenders with a taut tale of abduction and frayed psychology that almost amorously borrows from Hitchcock's Psycho. Still, in spite of this textbook familiarity, Shyamalan still(!) somehow manages a work as loopy and hard to navigate as any of his more labyrinthine psychodramas. On the surface, he's conjured a setting rife for a satisfyingly campy b-thriller a-la Sam Raimi, replete with jittery, claustrophobic camera-work, an appropriately creaky, ominous soundtrack by West Dylan Thordson, and contrived enough reasons to strip his captive coeds to make Sharknado roll its eyes. And, for the sequences when Split commits to pure, primal 'what's around that corner' breathlessness, like a slightly sillier but equally chilling bunker buddy of last year's 10 Cloverfield Lane, it is effective as hell, and pure popcorn fun. But, rather than committing to the amiable wink and nod, Shyamalan clouds his film with an uneasily out-of-place streak of (yawn) seriousness. To say the least, it sits uneasily with a wagon-load of aped genre tropes - a grainy aesthetic that hearkens back to the Doom era of action horror, hazy mental health fretting, Madonna/whore obsessions, clumsy flashbacks to our tortured protagonist's tortured childhood torturedly; even a healthy helping of cringe-worthy self- harm hero-worshipping? - that would've felt stale in a straight-to-DVD late night special from the early 2000s. The film's lugubrious editing doesn't help, making McAvoy's mysterious madman feel as sluggish as he is indecipherable. And if that wasn't enough, Shyamalan sifts in a shroud of self-important faux-mythology (wide-eyed characters whisper mental health bunk as if reciting sacred texts, conflating mental health disorders with superpowers in a way that is, amazingly, both cloyingly infantilizing and alienating as hell) that would be borderline offensive if it wasn't such silly claptrap. Then, for those masochistic viewers still desperately trying to wrangle the film into being worth it, try our arch-foe(s)' motivation on for size: McAvoy's multiple personalities (or at least some of them ) kidnap high school girls something- something confused sexuality something-something abused as a child blah blah worshipping superpowered Satanic death cult to punish them for not having suffered enough? Hel-LO-O! They're in high school! Methinks it's you who doesn't know the meaning of the word suffer, Mr. 'Beast.' Go back to pining over a rose. Maybe sing about it. And the invariable Shyamalan 'twist?' Only that nothing, not even standalone passion projects made by former art-house darlings, is safe from the encroaching, wearing mega-blockbuster trend towards interconnected cinematic 'universes.' Yes - our entire movie outing here exists for the sake of shoehorning in an almost staggeringly self-indulgent finale linking the film to Shyamalan's Unbreakable - a modest hit from 17 years ago(!) that a minimal percentage of viewers might remember offhand sans google - just so he can chase the superhero bandwagon like Tobey Maguire pitifully wheezing after his departing bus in Spider-Man? Nah. No thank you indeed. Good day to you, sir. The film's main selling, of course, is showcasing James McAvoy's range, with the kind of role actors fight tooth and nail to show off with. Thankfully, he's fairly excellent, and transitions so seamlessly between flamboyant personalities (including some pretending to be others... oooh!) with subtle shifts of face and posture. It's almost a shame that he has to contort to the dopey 'superpower' conceits of Shyamalan's script, as he's easily fascinating and scary enough on his own without crawling on the ceiling like a bargain basement Underworld counterfeit. Apart from the central novelty of McAvoy, Anya Taylor- Joy gives an impressively enigmatic, haunted performance as our leading teen, plagued by plenty of inner demons pre-abduction (though, again, she's better off emoting on her own right, rather than having her performance hand- held by irksome, unnecessary PTSD flashbacks). Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula are both solidly credible, in spite of the 'panting cheerleader' stereotypes they're saddled with, while Betty Buckley works her darnedest to ground her breathy exposition-dolling plot devise of a therapist with wry sharpness and astute charisma. The thing is, you want to like Split. You can practically smell the sweat on Shyamalan trying to rekindle his rep, and scorning poor McAvoy, practically bleeding energy onto the screen, feels like kicking a (psychopathic) puppy. And hey - if you're in the market for a silly, braindead little thriller full of nerves and amiable nonsense, Split will pass the time with a couple of jumps, shivers, and chuckles, both intentional and not. But as a purported comeback from the mind behind The Sixth Sense, and with another Unbreakable sequel that next to nobody will be waiting eagerly for still in the pipeline? Let's just say that none of us, least of all Night, are now strangers to the Beast's suffering litmus test of worthiness. -6.5/10","

Night Shyamalan's alleged return to glory isn't very glorious at all. It certainly is creepy but not in an entertaining way. When the last 30 seconds is the best part of the movie and it's only that way because it references a far better Shyamalan movie than the movie you just endured is a failure. Setting up a future shared Shyamalan universe is intriguing but it relegates this movie to nothing but an extended DVD extra setting up a supervillain for a better movie to come. Massive bonus points for McAvoy's performance. The split personality characters he embodies really are the only reason to endure this movie. It's acting class on a Masters level. Everything else is sadistic, cruel and as entertaining as watching animals suffer.","

"Split","Michael_Elliott","2 February 2017","Split (2017) *** (out of 4) James McAvoy plays a man with twenty-three different personalities who kidnaps three young girls and holds them hostage in an unknown location.Normally I offer up more more of a plot description but the less you know about this film the better you'll enjoy it. M. Night Shyamalan's SPLIT is certainly a very interesting movie that clearly seems to have been inspired by the various Brian De Palma thrillers that he directed throughout his career. I had a couple major issues with the film but there's still no doubt that the director-writer is back on top of his game in this well-made and at times tense thriller.What I enjoyed most about the film should come as no surprise. James McAvoy really gets to shine in this film as you'd expect since he plays so many different characters. I'm not going to spoil all of the personalities but it was really amazing getting to see a talented actor play a chess match and come up with the various different personalities and bringing little touches to each of them. There are a few scenes where the actor is forced to go from one character to another in the matter of seconds and he perfectly nails it. There's no question that he brings a wide range of emotions as there are times where you feel bad for him and other times where he's downright creepy to say the least. All of the supporting cast are good but Ana Taylor Joy deserves a special mention.The screenplay most takes place inside this unknown location where we see the three girls being stalked by one personality after another. The film exits the location a couple times including introducing us to the man's doctor who is trying to control the personalities as well as some flashback scenes dealing with the main girl's childhood. It's here where I think the film makes it's biggest mistake. I don't mind anything that's in the actual film but it ends up running at a 118-minutes and I thought this was a bit too long and slow. I think everything in the film could have worked much better with a faster pace and perhaps a tighter editing job.With that said, there's no question that SPLIT holds your attention throughout and yes, there's that ending, which I certainly won't spoil here but I found it to be excellent. It's great that Shyamalan is back and doing such fine work and I really can't wait to see what he does next.","

"Split","Fluke_Skywalker","8 January 2018","Plot; Three teenage girls are kidnapped by a man with Dissociative identity disorder whose various personalities perform an increasingly macabre play for his literally captive audience. The arc M. Night Shyamalan's career is an interesting one. Though not technically his first film, for all intents and purposes The Sixth Sense is the beginning of his career. For better or worse, that film's infamous twist branded him as the ""twist guy"". Follow-up Unbreakable was less successful both critically and commercially (likely due audiences expecting one thing and getting something else entirely), but has since grown in stature and may rank as his most beloved. Signs had Newsweek declaring him the next Spielberg and it seemed nothing could stop the Shyamalan express. Then came The Village. Though a hit, it was less so than his previous efforts, and the twist left fans divided. From there it was a bit of a downward spiral. Lady in the Water left people scratching their heads, and The Happening had them laughing in a bad way. No longer able to do M. Night Shyamalan films, he took for hire gigs like The Last Airbender and After Earth. They weren't catastrophic financial flops, but neither film was well received (though I actually liked After Earth). But then Shyamalan made The Visit, which did modestly well (though exceptionally well when juxtaposed against its tiny budget) and met with equally modest critical response (though exceptional when juxtaposed against his previous efforts this decade).That brings us to Split. A hit with critics and audiences, it seemed to signal Shyamalan getting his mojo back. This wasn't a for hire gig, but a return to the kinds of films he'd built his reputation on. The latter is certainly true. Whatever else it is, Split is pure Shyamalan. The first two acts are very solid, with Shyamalan slowly winding the string tighter and tighter as his principle cast do excellent work; particularly James McAvoy. Playing a man with 23 personalities (though only about a quarter of those are shown), he creates distinct characters. Sometimes transforming right before your eyes. It's impressive stuff, and worthy of Oscar consideration. Things fall apart a bit in the third act, as Shyamalan doubles down on the more fantastical aspects of the story with diminishing returns. A last second reveal does change how we view these events, and in this new context the last act works considerably better. Whether or not Split would've worked better as a standalone piece without the more fantastical elements than it does now merged with another of Shyamalan's works is up to the viewer. For me, I kinda side with the former, but I must admit that I'm intrigued to see where things go from here in the announced sequel.","

We are much smarter than that and the same old tropes that we see in characters are just annoying. Even down to young girls running around with no bras. So old. We can give it a couple of pts for the last seen just on principle. But as a film I am not in the court that says M. Night is back.

McAvoy charms the audience with his brilliant (at times comedic) portray of the Hedwig personality, and does a good job making other personalities like Dennis, Ms Patricia and the beast frightening and creepy in their own ways. McAvoy does a good job separating the personalities from one another, making each seem like individual characters.The other performances in this movie are also good, Anya Taylor-Joy played her character fairly well, especially during the more dramatic scenes, and i hope to see more dramatic work from her in the future. The other two girls did decent jobs but nothing really special about their performances. Betty Buckley's character was fairly well done as well.Although this is a fairly well made film, i did have a few errors with pacing, the flashback scenes felt very shoehorned in and confusing at first. Shyamalan's camera-work and writing also seemed to be a bit messy at times, mainly during the first act of the movie, but was fine for the majority of the movie.However, although this isn't a perfect film, it's definitely worth a watch, and it's a good sign for Mr Shyamalan's career. Fans of his earlier work will hopefully appreciate this film like i did, especially the obligatory plot twist. :)","

Then we work through some suspense and finally make it to the ending and........THAT is where the big disappointment hits us.

"Split","animupizza","28 January 2017","Tired old trope of using a person with a mental illness as a plot for a scary movie. Unoriginal, and ableist.Mental illness, especially misunderstood illnesses like dissociative identity disorder, are incredibly stigmatized in our society. They're often seen as scary, and the people suffering from them are often labeled as dangerous, making it difficult for them to receive help and support. Movies like ""Split"" further this stigma. There is very little media representation for people with DID, many people don't know much of anything about the illness, so when movies present it as something that makes people dangerous, others have no reason not to take this as a fact. In reality, people with DID are not abusers, but people who themselves have been abused. DID is an illness that develops after long term exposure to trauma occurring before the person turned nine years old. It develops because the trauma is too much for the young person's brain to handle, so their personality ""splits"" off into different parts, so that they don't have to. Movies show these alters as violent, but really, people with DID are usually only a danger to themselves. Showcasing them as the kind of people who would kidnap and abuse teenage girls is a gross inaccuracy, that again, wouldn't matter so much if it wasn't basically the only media representation of this illness.Because of the belief that these people are violent and dangerous, not only is it difficult for them to find support, but societal biases are often internalized. Mentally ill people are not violent abusers. But the stigma furthered by these movies contributes to the belief that they are. Mentally ill people need support, they need to be normalized, they do not need any more horror movies that use them as the scary abuser. I hope that in the future we can move past movies like this, and towards acceptance. Mentally ill people deserve better.","

I the movie really began to go hit downhill with the main character changes from someone with mental illness to a strong powerful almost supernatural creature is intended on destroying the lives of people. The movie almost makes it seem like it's better for them to die. This is extremely problematic considering the movie initially talks about having a real-life mental illness. Also the way to dissociated personality disorder is shown is inaccurate and extremely weird. The movie is very inconsistent sometimes it makes you try and feel sympathy for the main character and other times it depicts him as an unstable monster.

'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakble', 'Signs' and 'The Village' are all some of my favourite films to this day. Films like 'Lady in the Water', 'The Last Airbender' and 'After Earth' on the polar opposite end of the scale are completely unbearable to watch and deserve no praise at all. It has been a bizarre career to date containing the highest of highs, and the lowest of lows. 2015's 'The Visit' however was a hint that he may be righting himself again and now 'Split' has absolutely confirmed it. Shyamalan is back baby!I was completely hooked by 'Split' from the moment I first saw the trailer. What a brilliant concept that lends itself to so many possibilities and so much potential. James McAvoy in the lead role must not have been able to believe his luck when he was offered the part. A character with 24 different personalities - an actor's dream. I thought he was quite brilliant in the role too. He completely sold me on every personality he performed and brought a tremendous level of intensity to the role. The only problem with the film I could possible perceive is a slight lack in advancement of the story. Things can feel a little stationary at times with an almost two hour run time. Other than that though this is near perfect film making. All of Shyamalan's class as a film maker is on show. The opening scene is brilliant, the flashbacks are masterful and the final scene of the film will leave you shivering (if you're anything like me). The brilliance of that final scene is unlike anything I've seen in a very long time. Shyamalan is back and that is brilliant news for film lovers around the world.","

"Split","parleon-thedon","21 January 2017","M. Night Shyamalan is a director trying to find his way back into the consciousness of the movie-going audience.Split which is written and directed by Shyamalan seems like a movie that is trying to win you over without doing very much.The actors in this movie are great. Anya Taylor-Joy, Jessica Sula, and Haley Lu Richardson are all exceptional actors who delivered fine performances here.James McAvoy is the star of this show and his performance is the make or break of this movie's soul. How can an actor handle and portray so many characters simultaneously? Every character that McAvoy portrays here is brilliant. I can say that McAvoy pretty much steals the entire show with his performances.Split likes to play on situations. What would you do if someone attacked you? The movie illustrates that you have no idea what you would do if a life or death situation arose. I found myself yelling at the screen during certain moments because of the idiotic decisions I thought the three main characters were making. However, no matter how idiotic I thought their decisions were, I know that everybody's different, and nobody would handle every situation the exact same way.Split plays out like a puzzle builder; You constantly get small pieces of the puzzle as the movie progresses, but you don't get a clear image as to what you're looking at yet. The movie feels obligatory once all of the pieces are in place.The music and the directing here is great.Overall, I enjoyed this movie for the most part, but it felt obligatory once everything was said and done. I know what this movie ties into and I won't spoil it, but the final scene truly establishes the rest of the movie. However, that little piece of information doesn't excuse this movie's obligatory nature. I'm stuck in the middle with M. Night Shyamalan's Split and I truly believe that he can do better than this.Final Grade: C","

"Split","vze2363v","8 April 2017","I'm going to leave a couple of blank lines just in case you didn't see the SPOILER warning...but apparently it doesn't work. First, I'm going to say I don't particularly like horror movies, so if you're a big horror fan, you MAY love this movie. I hate any movie where women act stupid, helpless, slow...you get the idea. Poverty makes a woman intolerant and if you are a strong woman, this movie is going to seem like someone is slowly scratching their nails across a chalkboard. By the end of the movie I was hoping the beast would kill the victim!The story line is simple. Stupid girl doesn't pay any attention to her surroundings, stupid girl let's guy drug her and her two friends with aerosol, guy shoves 3 stupid girls in a locked room and keeps them there while he goes through his alternate personalities. There are plenty of chances for girls to escape, run away, but then they get all ""oooo, I'm a girl, I can't use my brain, I have to be helpless"" and they get locked in different rooms. In the end, multi-personality guy changes into a mutant and kills his shrink and two of the girls. When he gets to the last girl we painfully watch as she just acts idiotic, drops shotgun shells all over, has a chance to kill the beast by shooting him multiple times at his C1 vertebrae, but does she do it? NOOOOO, she just lets him get away. Now there's a mutant killer running around free. At that point I was hoping a large piece of the ceiling would kill her and put US out of our misery. Instead she continues to act stupid, mousy, like she owes the guy because he didn't kill her. In the end, there's a special cameo that tie's into another M. Night Shyamalan movie. I will never go to another horror movie again.I know people will say, but it was all about a mental health issue and it was supposed to be complex, etc. My friend wanted to share the joy of the X-Men movies with me as I'd never seen them, so I'd watched all of them in chronological order (including Logan). I also watch Legion on TV, so I'm over the whole multi-personality thing. Again, if you like horror, maybe you'll like this. If you HATE watching women acting stupid and helpless, stay away from this film. You'll be doing yourself a favor. Buyer beware!","

I came on here to read some of the reviews as I remember when I added this film to my watchist it had a high IMDb rating. What could others possibly have seen in this film that I didn't? Well, not much apparently when you work your way through the obviously fake reviews with some being so brazen as to repeat the exact same review a previous fake profile had already submitted. The site is rampant with them! The same must be the case with the Metacritic scores where certain reviewers are obviously being paid off. How sad, really. The director also produced the film and I see it has grossed millions already. It's a great money making tactic.. you have money so you can put it into making a bad film, then invest more money in buying Metacritic scores and fake IMDb profiles to boost its ratings and create a hype around the film, ensuring enough people will see your film in order for you to turn a hefty profit. This experience has soured IMDb for me. It's a great source for creating your own lists and exploring films, but take the IMDb ratings, reviews and even the Metacritic scores with a grain of salt.","

"Split","EvilAxe","3 May 2017","With time being our most precious commodity, I try to carefully select the movies I do watch, as I don't have a ton of time to watch them. But the hype around this movie, and of course the (mind boggling) 7.4 IMDb rating tempted me enough to give it a chance. I sat down excited with my favorite snacks - hoping to be in for what some called 'one of the best horror movies this year so far'.Wow.... really? Horror? This is NOT horror. It's a suspense thriller / drama at best. This movie couldn't even scare a 12 year old. And THIS is supposed to be the ""return of M Night Shyamalan""? What? I absolutely loved Signs, and The Sixth Sense is amazing too. But his movies since have gone down hill. The Visit was very lackluster and pretty disappointing too. But not as disappointing as this stinker. At least with The Visit - there was no claims or hype saying this was his 'return to form' so I didn't expect a lot. But Split? This is more like a terribly executed amateur film students idea of a ""thriller"". The first 20-30 minutes, the movie has your interest a little bit as you wonder about the kinds of twists and surprises you are about to treated to. Maybe the guy is a ghost? Maybe there are actually more than one main protagonist? Maybe the girls are in an alternate reality? Maybe there is an actual, physical, hairy (as they describe him) monster that we will soon get to see? Oh man...that would be cool.. These are things I was eagerly thinking as I was watching, hoping I would be right, and that if so - these plot twists could turn this how I would have written if it I was behind it.But nope. As time goes on, you realize, there is NOTHING exciting happening. Just some incredibly boring dialogues, a character study of multiple personality disorder, some dumb girls trying to escape, and several conversations between a shrink and her patient. *Yawn* The ending? I was half asleep at that point but it was extremely underwhelming and disappointing. So the 'beast' just looks like the dude, just with some veins popping out, and he can climb walls? Wow, amazing. Not.Save your time and do not listen to the positive reviewers. I think they were paid by Universal Studios to bring up the overall score here.","

"Split","cherold","20 October 2017","Split is possibly the most creepy and suspenseful movie of director Shymalan's career. This dark film follows three girls kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities, brilliantly played by James McAvoy, whose transitions from one personality to another are seamless and who maintains a disturbed, threatening quality through all of them.The movie was, however, slightly wrecked for me because I was trying to guess the ""twist"" that some critics claim the movie has. Here's the thing to know: no one would be saying this movie had a twist if it wasn't directed by someone famous for his twists.A twist is when you are lead to believe something and then your perspective is shifted. It's something Twilight Zone did a lot.Split certainly has plot turns, some of them interesting, some rather unconvincing, but none all that surprising. This is a movie about suspense and character, not brilliant plotting. If you spend the movie, as I did, trying to figure out how Shyamalan is going to flip everything on its head, it will take you out of the movie and lead nowhere. But if you just appreciate the beautifully constructed shots and the flow of action, you'll be impressed.There is something very surprising in the last second of the movie, but it's not a plot twist because it doesn't come out of the story. Most people will have to google the ending to understand what it means.This twist distraction is not Shyamalan's fault, but that of critics determined to talk about the director in twist terms regardless of the movie. I just wanted to let people know that, as a public service, so that they can enjoy the movie without false expectations. Because it's well worth watching.","

"Split","KrabbyPatties","28 January 2017","Have never wrote a review before on IMDb but logged in just to comment on how inexplicably bad this is. First of all, how is this crap film getting 9/10s and 8/10s? I am genuinely asking because I cannot comprehend how anyone who has seen this film would rate it in that manner. I got duped by all the favorable reviews praising M.Night's new thriller and walked into the cinema with great hopes, shining, bountiful hopes, despite the utter tragedies of the films he had directed before. It seemed like a great concept, DID + James McAvoy? I was so ready for this. Now a big portion of why this didn't work out was because of the script. It had all the hallmarks of amateurish writing. Gaping plot holes, corny and cheesy dialogue, scenes that made you want to scream at the characters for making extremely poor decisions etc. One of my biggest gripes were that the 3 main personalities they crafted for James McAvoy seemed to be very stereotypical. You had the uptight, OCD, neat-freak Dennis, the tranquil Patricia, constantly wearing a shawl to convince us of her innate zen-ness and finally, Hedwig, a 9 year-old with a crippling case of the lisp, yadda yadda ya, he has his precocious moments as most children do, nothing very interesting. Hedwig was also oft used as a plot device to inject humour into the film, I did not think they meshed well with the overall tone of the movie, scenes where he popped up were enjoyable but at the same time felt more like a tick off the checklist, the attempts to introduce levity throughout the film did not flow well and felt contrived. I would say McAvoy did a great job with the material he was given but bad writing is after all, bad writing. The stilted dialogue didn't help things at all. The 3 teenaged girls did not fare well on the acting front as well. I have watched Anya Taylor-Joy in The Witch and she did pretty good there so it was somewhat puzzling to see her performance in this movie, granted it was better than the other 2 but it was still rather lacking. I would've thought being captured by a deranged madman would have been much more frightening than how it was portrayed in the film.Going into the third act of the film, the psychiatrist made some extraordinarily bad decisions, including investing too much into a patient, visiting a patient with 23 personalities, some rather dubious in character, in the middle of the night. By herself. Without informing anyone else. Really? Fast forward into the film and she's been drugged by Dennis. The first thing she does upon awakening is to write down the full name of Kevin, which we know is the one thing that is capable of pulling him into the light and giving him the power of his own body. She, however does not utter the name when the Beast is attacking her, does not even bother to say it as she tries to stab him unsuccessfully over a long drawn out moment. Yes, the Beast was squeezing her torso/mid body but she could still have said something (the way he constricted her body did not make it seem that she was unable to speak), knowing this was the only fail-proof way to get Kevin to return. Another gripe was the supernatural element of the film. The way they introduced the Beast felt so terribly banal and cliché. Veins bulging out of his body, ripping his shirt off, fleeing across urban landscapes in the dark, climbing and scaling buildings. It was like a watered down hulk? Hulk-lite? It wouldn't have felt out of place in a cheesy superhero flick at all. Except that it attempted to be a serious psychological thriller which makes me want to scream why, over and over again at the screen.And don't even get me started on the ending. (from the point that they discovered the girl) It went from a 5/10 to a 3/10. Some people enjoyed the Unbreakable reference, I found it exceedingly stupid, a cheap easter egg gimmick they threw in at the end of the film to give fans something to salivate over. Overall, I thought it had an interesting premise and extremely bad execution. Stop giving M.Night future projects. Stop indulging him in the same kind of shitshow he's been making for years. And for Christ's sake, if he's going to be making movies, please hire an actual capable writer to write the damn script and dialogue.TL; DR: Pros- McAvoy's performance, cinematography Cons- Everything else","

"Split","OttoVonB","30 May 2017","From prodigy to punchline, M. Night Shyamalan has had fascinating highs and lows as a filmmaker. The man once hailed as the heir to Hitchcock or Spielberg was soon compared to Ed Wood and Uwe Boll... I always found this a bit unfair, due to the tasteful notes sprinkled throughout even his most inept films. But he's finally crossed a line.Celebrated as a return to form for the creator of the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, Split follows damaged teen Casey (Anja Taylor-Joy) and 2 cliché bitchy teenager friends, who get abducted by Kevin (James McAvoy). The catch being that his disturbed cranium houses 21 conflicting personalities, with the promise of a very sinister 22nd on the way. Intriguing concept. What might the twist be?There are - contrary to what you might have heard - two twists in Split. The first is that it mostly does exactly what it tells you it's going to do. And boy is there a lot of telling rather than showing in this overdrawn yarn! The beats are telegraphed in advance and the jumps predictable. The second twist plays squarely in the current trend of exploiting viewer nostalgia: in what might be his most forgettable film, Shyamalan dares to shove in a horribly contrived parallel to his greatest work. If Split is meant as a parallel sequel to that other film, then it shares none of the stylistic identity, which makes the forced kinship feel unnatural. Speaking of style, the filmmaker has also sadly broken with his earlier aesthetic in most of the ways you could imagine. The visual elegance and fluency of his first 3-4 films is gone - as, sadly, is longstanding collaborator James Newton Howard. After plumbing the depths of found footage in his previous film, Shyamalan delivers a film that is often bland and sometimes downright ugly to watch. Any positive commentary on this film has to do with its cast, so let's give them their due: McAvoy has a ball with his various personalities. It's never subtle stuff, but he throws himself at it and hops effortlessly between all 21 personalities in Kevin's head. Taylor-Joy, a revelation in The Witch, is, once again, luminous, transcending a half-baked part and giving these dreary proceedings what little believability they have. Her partners in confinement barely register, and, hamstrung as she is with terrible expository dialogue, poor Betty Buckly as the caring psychiatrist manages to deliver the worst performance in a M. Night Shyamalan film - yes, even one that features the customary terrible director cameo!By now the irony of this review's title - and of the situation itself - should be obvious. Shyamalan would have you believe he's come full circle, back to the glory days of his debut. The truth is much sadder: pushed to the limit and with nothing left in him, yesterday's wunderkind is left scraping the bottom of the barrel for echoes of past glories. In that sense, he is sadly representative of an entire industry with a crisis of creativity.","

"Split","cschultz-2","23 January 2017","Fairly early in the filmmaking career of M. Night Shyamalan, the Philadelphia-based writer and director suffered a terrible professional misfortune—three consecutive films he wrote, produced, and directed became enormous critical and commercial successes.The Sixth Sense in 1999, Unbreakable in 2000, and Signs in 2002—and to a lesser extent The Village in 2004—were mostly lauded by critics for their innovation and imagination, and were embraced an adopted by audiences, many of whom returned for repeat viewings. The Sixth Sense additionally spawned a catchphrase—""I see dead people""—still quoted as among the most familiar in motion picture history.After those remarkable feats of box office legerdemain, critics began mentioning Shyamalan's name in the same exulted breath as Steven Spielberg—and worse, Alfred Hitchcock. Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan often included an unexpected, surprise twist in the plot at the end of his pictures, and also usually either played a small role or made a quick cameo appearance in his pictures. Unfortunately for Shyamalan, after reaching such a rarefied cinematic stratosphere there was precisely one way to go. And from Lady in the Water in 2006 through the almost unwatchable After Earth in 2013, and 2015's The Visit, the filmmaker has been mostly descending into a maelstrom of pedestrian filmmaking.But Shyamalan is trying to reverse his recent misfortunes: In his new picture, Split, released Friday by Universal Pictures, three teenage girls are kidnapped together by a man who reveals himself to be a disturbed individual indeed. The girls' abductor transports the girls to an undisclosed location and tosses them into what appears to be a damp medieval dungeon with cots and a spotless and well-appointed full bathroom.Quickly revealed is that the kidnapper suffers from dissociative identity disorder, multiple personalities. And while each of the man's twenty-three separate personalities seem vaguely aware of each other, only one or two appear to be in charge. Those couple of personalities are prepared to give profane birth to an entirely new manifestation, one which promises unspeakably bad news for the three involuntary guests.Split itself swiftly develops multiple personalities in the form of separate plots: It turns out the kidnapper, played by Scottish actor James McAvoy, has been in the psychiatric care of a renowned and well-heeled psychiatrist played by Betty Buckley, almost unrecognizable from her days as the mom on television's Eight is Enough.The good doc has apparently been earning a pretty penny from papers and lectures about her star patient's multiple maladies. And while the patient has of late appeared fairly benign, the psychiatrist—unknowing of the kidnapping—senses something unsettling enough to begin sniffing around to learn what's cooking.Meanwhile, back in the dungeon, the three kidnapped girls continue to plot, mostly unsuccessfully, to escape their confinement. And eventually it's learned that one of the three girls—the quiet, unpopular high school outcast Casey—has been raised in the footsteps of her loving outdoors-man father, and knows a thing or two about hunting, stalking, and killing prey.Mostly, Split is McAvoy's show, a real tour de force for the actor. It's sometimes forgotten that prior to the actor's recent steady gig as the young Professor Charles Xavier in the popular Marvel Comics X-Men series of pictures—three appearances and counting—as well as in plainly execrable garbage like 2015's Victor Frankenstein, McAvoy was once considered to be a talent of some promise, with performances in such acclaimed pictures as 2006's The Last King of Scotland in 2006 and Atonement in 2007.Possibly the challenge of playing and individual with twenty-three distinct and different personalities was McAvoy's means of groping his way back to his original promise. Unfortunately, the actor seems to perform each individual manifestation with a knowing little smirk, an implied wink at the audience, which keeps the viewer constantly aware that this is a performance, a stunt, and is not believable or credible so much as it is mildly impressive as an acting school exercise.The flip side of McAvoy's multiple characters is Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey, the kidnapped girl whose survivalist background—and whose own troubled childhood—might provide a key to escaping her confinement. Recently appearing in 2015's controversial and disturbing The Witch, Taylor-Joy contributes a performance which is competent but not particularly evocative—the audience is anxious for the character's situation more than for the character herself. Taylor-Joy with her wide-eyed, emotionless stare seems to be in a hypnotic trance most of the way through the picture's 117 minutes.There's nothing really wrong with Split—the picture delivers enough suspense, chills, jumps, starts and surprises to justify the cost of admission, although it's also sometimes tough to comprehend how the picture escaped the MPAA's clutches with a PG-13 rating when the menace and the subject matter alone should've earned at least an R. One genuinely unsettling early scene in which the kidnapper terrorizes his hostages even strays briefly into NC-17 territory.But thrills aside, the biggest casualty of Split is M. Night Shyamalan's reputation as an innovative filmmaker. Three plots running simultaneously is at least one plot too many. Subtract the survivalist plot and Split becomes a Classics Illustrated version of The Silence of the Lambs, a movie Split references endlessly anyway. Take away the psychiatrist's sleuthing and Split becomes last year's Don't Breathe, Ten Cloverfield Lane, or any of a number of the dozen or so other ubiquitous horror opuses which seem to open almost weekly Mostly, Split references Shyamalan's earlier successes—almost literally, thanks to a significant cameo and line of dialogue at the very end of the picture.But Thomas Wolfe could've told Shyamalan—you can't go home again. Instead, Split suffers from the very mediocrity the director seems to want to emulate from lesser films but exceed in quality and surpass in effectiveness, a feat Hitchcock accomplished in 1960 with Psycho. Possibly Split would've been more successful in its ambition had it been guided by the steady hand of a Steven Spielberg or an Alfred Hitchcock.","

I just finished watching it and feel like it's the type of film that will stay with me for many days afterwards. That final scene had me yelling out loud in excitement!It is the most ""M. Night Shyamalan"" film in years, so I can definitely see why people are describing this as a return to form. The complex spattering of themes throughout and bigger-life-picture vibe was certainly there too. Killer script and writing which is refreshing at a time when too many movies are becoming mundane or lazy.It also worked as good as any other thriller/horror out there. I wouldn't even know what genre to put this in - I don't think M. Night Shyamalan films belong in any concrete genre. I felt claustrophobic and uneasy watching this the whole time. In that sense, I didn't find it easy watching. But I couldn't look away.Much of the reason I couldn't look away was due to James McAvoy's career best performance.

"Split","AudioFileZ","28 January 2017","Watching Split can be a frustrating experience if you wish too hard for the movie to go like it starts. With the abduction of three teenage girls by a genuinely creepy assailant Split gets off to a sinister start. Right away it becomes a James McAvoy acting class as we learn this isn't anything as one would expect. McAvoy has about two dozen personalities which his therapist believes she's getting both an education and a handle on. This is where some restraint might have kept a different thriller chugging along steadily building a more credible story. Of course this is M. Night Shamalayan so the paranormal has to be injected right along side the attempt at realism. It was brilliant in his Sixth Sense only seeming to weigh down what had so much potential here. It is not, however, a train wreck as it remains watchable slowly revealing the pathos of both the McAvoy character and Casey who is the odd-duck of the three girls. The hard-to-swallow part is how the McAvoy character continues to function being so out of control while manipulating his, we're led to believe, esteemed therapist, plus he's living below the NYC zoo in a secret madman's liar. A wall climbing scene totally jerks what little believably is left by the ending. Yes, with Shamalayan I know I should expect this, even though it comes off rather silly. Frustration is how good it started versus how it failed to use that start's potential fully. Plenty of folks are going to be ""split"" on this film.","

"Split","aharmas","4 February 2017","""Split"" gives us quite a gift, an audacious and original film that will leave you wondering what you have seen, and it even has a theme: ""you can be whatever you wish..."" The question is whether you'll agree with that assessment. James McAvoy knew he couldn't pass on the opportunity to play a part (well, 23 parts within the same character). We get to meet Dennis and the rest of the gang when the stronger, but not necessarily best of the bunch have been plotting a take over. In order to fully succeed, we discover they need three sacrificial lambs.With a tight grip on the camera and his screenplay, we begin our journey into several types of hell: Dennis' own, the three imprisoned victims', the psychologist's slow realization that something is now more unstable than before, which could only mean trouble, and to add a bit of misdirection? a backstory for one of the trapped girls which might be more relevant than some people will be able to understand. ""Split"" is a film that you probably need to see a couple of times to fully comprehend. It's sort of like having a great meal, and then enjoying some of the best leftovers from that same meal, and the centerpiece is McAvoy, in a dazzling turn than leaves most of the recent entries in the dust, with the possible exception of Denzel, who like Oliver, Scott, Day Lewis are basically untouchable. McAvoy has joined their ranks, and he has done it with a performance that seems a greatest hits of any actor's career. In fact, he wears very little make up, and one of his most intriguing personas is a woman, but he is fully convincing in a creepy way, wearing a sweater, a long skirt, and not a hint of make up on his face. He retains his male voice, and yet, we believe we are facing a feminine entity. He is fully able to bring out every single element which is the trademark of each personality. The rhythm in the little boy's innocence, hesitation, and fear. His Barry is truly a joy to watch and Dennis is chilling. He manipulates voices, intonations, subtle nuances which fully transition from one to another. In addition to that, we have his incredible command of his physicality. His walking changes, and then we have his eyes and his mouth, doing some of the most impressive I have seen in hundreds of films. Day Lewis was glorious in ""Lincoln"" fully channeling the spirit of the President. I'm not sure where the 23 personalities came from. It's like he brought with him his family, friends, and most of the community he grew up with, and then there's the beast.The movie's preview seemed to have given us too much. We thought we knew how the whole story would unravel, pointing to a stock ending. Instead, we are traveling through a structure that shows much growth in the direction of the man behind ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", and ""The Happening"". The film is always suspenseful, suffocating at times with the tension originating from the various set ups. We expect bloodshed, mayhem, and what we get is worse because the fear of something worse is hanging over the girls' fate, and we are now caught in their hell, not knowing where the next twist is.The conclusion might seem problematic to some because it brings together every little bit in the background. It fully explains the triggers for both of the main characters, and if we have been paying attention, we'll understand why Casey's fate turns out to be so unexpected. Is there room for more to come? Just like De Palma, we have that twist at the end because after all there's strength in unity, and we never know what we are fully capable of doing if we set our minds to it.","

"Split","rabbitmoon","18 January 2017","The best thing by far about Split is the performance by McAvoy. He has great fun switching personas, and the fun is infectious. Because of this, its best seen as a black comedy because you'll be smirking and giggling quite a bit at the little nuances. But without that performance, the film is pretty lame. The subplot of the girl captives trying to escape is nothing new, especially in an era of 10 Cloverfield Lane, Room, Green Room, Saw films etc. The therapy sections are extremely clichéd and dull, the old woman therapist badly underwritten. These scenes could have been so much more interesting. By the end, Shyamalan's immaturity as a filmmaker once again rears its ugly head, both trying to shoe-horn in some heavy themes (sexual abuse, self-harming) without any sensitivity or real emotional awareness, and also swerving the film firmly into absurd comic book territory. By this point its clear he didn't have a firm idea of the story he wanted to tell or why, just another gimmick that made itself up as it went, meandering all over the place. Basically, don't expect anything ""great"". Set your sights for a 2- star Netflix kinda film, then be pleasantly surprised by how fun and watchable it is (in a forgettable way).","

"Split","JakeRfilmfreak","16 February 2024","Split is a 2016 psychological horror thriller about a man with dissociative identity disorder who holds three teenage girls captive for sacrificial purposes.Although not a direct sequel to M. Night Shyamalans Unbreakable, it takes place in the same universe and once again deals with the concept of superhuman abilities. This is an excellent film all the way through, with some absolutely amazing performances. James McAvoy is incredible with his portrayal of Kevin Wendell Crumb and all of his personalities locking you in to where you can't take your eyes off the screen. The story is creepy, compelling, and completely creative. It's filled with suspenseful moments that tickle the hairs on the back of your neck, and a fantastic ending that will leave you walking away in anticipation for what's next to come.This is one of my favorite M. Night films, and if you haven't seen it before, It's an absolute must see.","

"Split","CountJonnie","26 March 2017","Shyamalan built his reputation on two, maybe three movies. His trademark is his originality and twists, and his many failed attempts to recreate them.Split is about a man with various personalities. McAvoy succeeds into playing various interesting persons, but that is the only good part of this movie. The girls who get kidnapped, their acting is atrocious. Seeing them try, you can only blame it on the script and the directing. Same goes for the therapist, who makes certain decisions that will only make you cringe.As the movie struggles to stand, it builds up to some semi- supernatural ending, which is so stretched out, that all credibility is lost and even McAvoy can't tie all lose strings anymore. Shyamalan does succeed into creating a nice atmosphere, but fails in the simple basics: an understandable plot, believable characters and coherent conversations. All three are missing.The best thing you can say about this movie is that it isn't as bad as The Happening, or Lady in the Water. But it is far worse than the rest. The biggest twists are the reviews that pretend that this is a decent movie.","

"Split","serpent_coil","3 February 2017","So Split is the latest movie from M. Night Shyamalan. Not having seen any of his movies since The Village nor being that familiar with the actors I didn't really have any expectations about this movie. Anyway, Split is a classic kidnapping-thriller. Three girls are kidnapped by an unknown assailant with multiple personalities and spends the movie trying to escape. Along the way they uncover disturbing truths about their kidnapper. In a parallel story the kidnappers psychiatrist suspects something and starts investigating on her own. Hardly groundbreaking stuff, then again there are plenty of fantastic movies with unoriginal structures. I was quite drawn in by the first half of the movie. The gradual reveal of the plot works fairly well. Sure, the dialogue was fairly wooden and there was little to no background on the main characters. The flashbacks that was supposed to breathe some life into the main character didn't really add much to the story or give much nuance to the character so much as being a pretty cheap plot device to tie the cheap ending together. For all it's flaws the first two thirds of the movie worked for me. The gradual reveal of the main antagonists personalities and motivation along with some decent acting from James McAvoy makes for just enough suspense to keep the viewer hooked. Like so many other movies the end is where it all falls apart. There is a special place in hell for writers who incorporate supernatural elements where there is absolutely no need for them. This movie would probably have worked much better as a semi-realistic thriller. The foreshadowing of supernatural elements are vigorously shoved in the viewers face during the whole film but I didn't really suspect they would be so over the top. Subtlety doesn't so much get thrown out the window as shot in the chest with a shotgun. Not to mention the protagonists escape that is heavy handedly tied to the forced flashbacks that plague the film and makes the end both over the top and anti-climactic at the same time. Honorable mention goes to the cheap tie in to Unbreakable in the movies dying seconds that seems lifted from a superhero movie rather than a sort of serious thriller. A seriously bad ending destroys what could have been a decent film.","

"Split","jasonpauljones-64690","9 September 2022","The first thing I must mention is you will either like Split or hate it. I hated it. There is no in between here and just as its title prophetically suggests, it will divide audiences straight down the guts. MacAvoy's boring display of being able to adequately and already assumably act in different guises, feels like nothing more than watching an audition in a Hollywood theatre. I liked Joy-Taylor in Last Night in Soho but this is not the movie for her talents, being wasted as a submissive scared little girl instead of in a strong-willed attitude role. Shyamalan is the man responsible for the negatives in Split, as he is in every shite movie he has made, being awarded the prize of the most overrated movie maker in the world. In a woeful attempt to coalesce stigmas in society, Shyamalan presents immature and horrifically misguided ideals, which he obviously and obscenely wants viewers to believe and follow unconditionally. Split is dubbed as a Horror but for the first 90 minutes it absolutely is not. Two scenes were ok, the first being in the opening sequences, where the three girls are abducted in their car, and then 87 minutes later when MacAvoy's character(s) crushes the very annoying and thankfully eventually dead psychologist. The pay off is the end of the movie, as in The End, closing credits welcomed like a cold brewsky on a hot summer's day.","

"Split","kermitkid","30 March 2020","I've had skepticism with M. Night Shamalayan lately. His films have been kind of hit-and-miss these past few years. I think if he does more of what he did with this movie, he can be back on top in a few years. This movie is crazy intense! It was actually a lot darker than I thought it would be. There are some extremely mature and dark themes and subject matter and it almost goes into rated R territory at points. However, it is these themes and subject matter that make these characters who they are, and explains why they act the way they do. James McAvoy's performance is particularly impressive. This film proves that he can play anyone a director needs him to play. There's moments where he's funny there's moments where he's chilling, and there's moments where his performance makes you hold your breath worried he'll harm you. The three young actresses in the film provide stellar performances as well. There's such range of emotion with them. You sympathize with them, you fear for them, you feel what they feel. Genuine, tearful performances, that actually look tearful and not like acting are hard to come by, and they pulled it off very well. Like I said, this film is very heavy. It's a hard PG-13. I don't want to advocate for this film due to the dark, heavy themes and subject matter so I don't want to say that it was a good movie. At times, it is very hard to watch. But judging it purely from a filmmaking standpoint of ""Was it well made? Was it well written? Was it well acted? Was it well directed?"" etc. the answer is yes. If you're a fan of M Night's earlier work, this hearkens back to that. It's still too early at this point to say if he's redeemed himself from the garbage that was ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth"", but if he can keep doing what he did with this film, he just might.

"Split","samuelding85","17 December 2016","After exploring the lives of the boy who sees ghosts and the man who survived several man-made accidents, director M Night Shyamalan creates a thriller based on a person suffering from Disoriented Identity Disorder (DID). SPLIT was born under this idea, which aims to gives the audience a good understanding about DID, but ends up leaving the theater feeling confused. Three teenage girls – Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Claire (Haley Lu-Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) were abducted by Kevin (James McAvoy) at a car park. Locked in an unknown underground cellar, the three girls discovered that they were greeted by Kevin in different forms under different names: Kevin dressed up and acts like a straight man, a woman, a child and a gay guy. The girls soon discovers that Kevin is suffering from DID, which he lives with 23 personalities. Meanwhile, Dr Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley) is seeing Barry (one of the personalities under Kevin), a young artist who claims that he is suffering from some personality disorder. While Dr Fletcher is trying to prove that a person suffering from DID have the ability to change their physiology, the three girls are using his various personalities to rescue themselves, before Kevin's 24th personality comes after them. As the title suggests, SPLIT was interpreted as someone with DID is living with split personalities. Though it was understood that McAvoy's Kevin was living with 23 personalities, only 8 personalities were seen in the entire film. With 8 personalities on display, this is not only challenging to McAvoy in terms of interpreting the respective personalities, it is also challenging for the audience to digest and understand the reason behind the distorted personalities. Audience were treated to McAvoy's interpretation on the different personalities he is living in, and how his respective personalities interact with his victims. However, this has starts to bore the audience, which some will find it time consuming and lack of interest, since everyone has more or less expected what will happens next. The first five minutes of the movie gets straight to the point directly, showing how the girls were abducted without any reasons. While audience were expecting to see how the girls are finding their ways to escape from their abductors, Shyamalan works differently compared to other movies which talks about how victims find their way to escape from their abductors. Audience were given an exploration on the lives of Kevin through his counseling appointment with Dr Fletcher, which was intervene with Casey's childhood experiences. The only link that brought Casey's childhood into the movie was towards the last ten minutes, showing how is she escaping from Kevin's 24th personality. With the overall presentation not shown in sequence, it is easy to make the audience feeling confused and distorted. McAvoy's portrayal of Kevin lives under different names through his different personalities. While it was mentioned in the synopsis that Kevin is suffering from DID and lives with 23 personalities, only 8 different types of personalities were showcased in the film. From playing a straight man, a lonely man, a woman, a child to a beast, McAvoy's performance was the only reason that kept the story from going on. Anya Taylor-Joy's performance of Casey is more of a compliment to the story. Her wit not only helps her to understand Kevin, but also serves as a way of saving herself in the times of danger. Somehow, the intervention of Casey's childhood trauma fails to compliment the story well, which overall it drags the duration of the film. To sum up, SPLIT has a hard time to identify its identity, which the movie is rather confusing. While McAvoy's performance saves the day and Taylor-Joy gets more screen time, this is another movie which Shyamalan is having a hard time to connect with his audience and fans.","

She's the weird outcast. She wasn't supposed to be in the car. McAvoy's hesitation with using Chloroform on her. There were only two beds. His female personality whispering about the ""two girls"". I could go on and on. She wasn't the target.They just continue giving the movie away so blatantly, that it's almost maddening as a viewer. There are four different instances before the beast appears where the personalities literally say ""you are pure, nothing bad has ever happened in your life, I have a special night planned for you"", while they are unraveling Casey's rape story.I mean, 30 minutes into the movie after the first clip with the Uncle, I was screaming at the screen saying ""Casey! Just tell McAvoy that you were raped and he will let you go!"".And then all the way to the very freaking end even after he is screaming about his hatred for ""pure"" people who have never had a tough life, she STILL can't grasp that all she has to do is reveal her rape. We have to sit there while M. Night unveils the scars on her body, as if it's the next coming of the ""Bruce Willis was dead the whole time?!"" reveal. Darn you, M. Night.

"Split","nathannicolarobertscouk","26 January 2017","As with any general split, it starts off small and controlled and eventually frays at the edges, with its problems and flaws growing increasingly difficult to ignore. A victim of a terrific central premise, it demonstrates signs of delivering the potential and promise teased in the first act alone - but it eventually becomes too unfocused and complex for the sake of doing so. If we stuck with the idea of Casey attempting to talk to each of the identities, uncovering their flaws and exploiting their weaknesses, it would perhaps be a far superior horror-thriller, one fuelled by a smartness and sophistication; instead, it's rather run of the mill, ludicrous and frustrating popcorn flick that botches its climax with an uncomfortable development and shoehorned twist. It becomes a little laughable and that is the one place you never want to strand your horror film. Shyamalan The Director does decent things here but Shyamalan The Screenwriter lets him down - it's almost as if he is suffering from his own split.FULL REVIEW - goo.gl/SemOkh","

Nope....And then to the ""Beast"". Really???!!!!

"Split","joecar5555","1 August 2017","Splits first 45 minutes are the best part of this movie with an intriguing look into the split personalities of Kevin, played by the excellent James McAvoy. It's within the small details of characterisation that astounds to still prove McAvoy as one of the best actors of this generation. His talent in being able to intertwine characters together is magnificent. Kevin and his 23 personalities respond well to Dr. Fletcher (Casey Cooke) who provides a great supporting role. This can not be stated about the Girls, they almost feel like a gimmick at times to keep your heart pounding. The movies aim in scaring is also unsatisfactory, hardly ever making the audience jump out of their skin. The overall story arc also slows terribly down in the last 30 minutes with some fundamental errors in storytelling almost dragging on too long. The dialogue in scenes, partially with the girls also seems a little trashy, I don't feel like Shyamalan captured these roles as well as Kevin and Dr. Fletcher. The score throughout the film keeps tensions a high but costume design feels a little rough around the edges. With constant swapping of personalities comes new costumes but at times characters don't adhere to what they are wearing which can occasionally become messy. Set design is also OK especially compared with the other recent Sci-fi, underground basement movie, 10 Cloverfield Lane. Overall, it is one of Shymalans finest films but still has many underlining problems especially with pacing and dialogue. 6/10","

Compelled to abduct three teenage girls led by the willful, observant Casey, Kevin reaches a war for survival among all of those contained within him, as well as everyone around him, as the walls between his personalities shatter apart.Split is the epitome of the term 'the final scene makes the whole film', because while Split is the directors best movie in fifteen years, some of the scenes in the film are almost fantasy, and appear not to make any sense, but this is why Shyalaman is such a wonderful storyteller when he really put his mind to it.McAvoy is completely wonderful as the troubled Kevin, and his performances are so good, you really believe that he is playing more than one different character, is it Shyalaman's sinister version of The Klumps? Of course not, but McAvoy morphs into the different personalities using nothing more than body language and voice changing, and it never once verges on the absurd.Camera-work is beautiful, with lots of close ups as if the film is almost analysing the audience watching the film.The kidnap part of the film is perfunctory stuff, and thank goodness the three girls get separated, because at one point, it almost verges on those awful teen horror remakes that polluted cinema screens in the noughties.Child abuse is a big part of the narrative, flashbacks hint at something more sinister, but it shows that the ones who get hurt, and are different because of major life changes, makes the person stronger, you hit rock bottom, there is no other way than up.Major Spoilers.............The twist of the film isn't something you'd guess, but it's a sequel of sorts, and it gave me goosebumps, and explained the fantasy element of the film.A wonderful film, and a return to form from the director","

"Split","mitchell5954","27 January 2019","Split is deemed as M. Night Shyamalan's big comeback as a filmmaker, and I'm inclined to agree. To say Shyamalan has had a hit or miss career would be an understatement. His first three films, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, were all quality movies, but afterward the man entered into a fifteen long year slump starting with The Village up to The Visit. So, when Split came out we were all pleasantly surprised to find out it was actually good. Yes, Split is a good movie. Is it Shyamalan's best? In my opinion, no. Unbreakable is still his best work. Sixth Sense is also better, though I enjoyed this movie a bit more. However, this is still a solid movie; certainly the best the man has put out in over a decade and a half.The plot is pretty simple. You have three girls leaving a party but get abducted by James McAvoy's character(s), The Horde, a man with twenty-three personalities occupying his mind. Now these three must try to survive and escape their tormentor. Meanwhile James McAvoy's doctor is notices that The Horde is acting peculiar, and is attempting to determine what's happening.What carries split, and makes it as good as it is James McAvoy's character(s). Seeing this man playing all these different personalities so brilliantly is great to watch. His performance should have at least easily nominated him for an Oscar, which never happened. The film has an eerie look and atmosphere to it' something Shyamalan has always excelled at even in his bad movies. The score isn't one of Shyamalan's best, but it complements the film pretty well.Once we get to the third act it becomes a thrilling survival horror film, which is when the film is at its best, in my opinion. Usually, the third act is when most Shyamalan movies fall apart, but here it's the best part of the movie.I do have some issues with Split, however. It does feel slow in spots. Some of it does feel like padding. The film is just under two hours, when it could've been just an hour and a half. Also, while James McAvoy is a lot of fun, I didn't care much for the three main girls. The main heroine is okay, but the other two girls are nothing characters. The scenes between McAvoy and his doctor were far more interesting to watch, or when the doctor is trying to explain The Horde's condition to the other scientists.Overall, Split is a good film, and was a good comeback for Shyamalan. I hope he can keep the momentum going, though Glass has been pretty divisive so things appear shaky once again for him.","

Split not even at the same level with Fight Club or even Identity.the things that disturbs me the most is how 'the writer' seems to enjoy half naked teens. one girl needs to take off her shirt, one girl needs to take off her skirt. and you would think they would go a little bit respect with female lead, but nope. save the best for last. she finally took her shirt off so they can save her character (rolling eyes). it is just so stupid and only shows how Hollywood movie and their writers exploit teen sexuality in a very smooth way and nobody seems to realize how sicks these writers are. i mean, it doesn't even contribute to the story line, or any character development (who ? dennis ? what a clever way to explain sexually mental disorder patient, huh). i mean, they could make the girls keep their clothes, and the movie will still be understood like it is. i don't mind with a little bit nudity when it contributes to the story (like in 3096 Days, as disturbing as it is, the girl nudity really give viewers better understanding of the kidnapper and the girl relationship). it's kinda suck for mc avoy, since this must be a very interesting character to be played. and as far as his acting goes, i don't have much complain. but got to be honest, his performance shone away by how bad the story is.","

McAvoy has the showy acting and he delivers. Anya Taylor-Joy does most of her work with her stone-face and those eyes. There is a nice sequence with a coat-hanger. I wonder if there is more tension to be had. M. Night keeps most of the violence off camera. I would definitely change the number 23 to something more manageable.

Night Shyamalan's new horror flick, about a man with DID (dissociative identity disorder) who kidnaps three young women and terrorizes them. Shyamalan wrote and directed the movie (on a budget of just $10 million) and it stars James McAvoy, Anya Taylor- Joy (who also co-starred in 'THE WITCH' and 'MORGAN'), Betty Buckley, Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been a huge hit at the Box Office. I enjoyed it as well.Three teenage girls are kidnapped, in broad daylight, while leaving a birthday party. Their captor is a man named Kevin (McAvoy), who also has 23 different personalities. Kevin locks the girls in a room, beneath a zoo, and continues to terrorize them; while demonstrating several different personalities. At the same time a psychologist, named Dr. Karen Fletcher (Buckley), tries to help Kevin. The doctor learns that Kevin is more than just a danger to himself, while the girls desperately try to escape him.Shyamalan used to be one of my favorite directors. I haven't been too impressed with his recent films, like many others, but this is definitely a well made movie. McAvoy is great in the lead, and I'm sure he had a lot of fun with the role. The film is both suspenseful and involving. There's also a great twist at the end, especially for fans of Shyamalan, and I can't wait to see what the filmmaker does next. It's not quite as good as his classic earlier work, but it is definitely an effectively well made thriller.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://youtu.be/RO7ghqXHCCY","

The quasi rape scene at the beginning leads to the Dr. saying the killer has a thing for women dancing naked, but this is never really needed in the story. This psycho-sexual fantasy he has is never revealed to be his original traumatic event, his motive to his actions, or even mentioned after the first half of the movie. Other than being used to scare the pee out of younger women (immoral pun) who fear sexual assault in our overly-sexually western society, this aspect to the killers psyche is irrelevant to the plot of the story. Second 1/2- This part of the film was great. Finding the uncomfortable line between reality and fantasy, MNS explores the possibility of superhuman capabilities that can be manifested through the mind when pushed to it's extreme limitations. Watching the movie, viewers find themselves wondering (alongside some of the characters) if there will be a supernatural manifestation. Very entertaining!Final Thought: Skip the first half, and just know that three girls get abducted by a man with DID and the psychologist that sees the abductor is suspicious that the personality she is meeting with is not the identity being portrayed. Pay close attention to the second. It's good.","

"Split","zkonedog","24 February 2017","The resume of filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan reads like a roller coaster: Peak (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs), Decline (Village, Lady In The Water), complete bottoming out (Happening, Devil, Last Airbender, After Earth), and recent resurgence (Visit). ""Split"" fits right in with that narrative, as it turns out to be Shyamalan's best movie this decade.For a basic plot summary, ""Split"" sees three teenagers Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Marcia (Jessica Sula), and Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) abducted by a mysterious man (James McAvoy) who seems to be harboring multiple personalities. As the girls struggle to find a way to stay alive and escape, the man's therapist (Betty Buckley) starts smelling something fishy, while flashbacks show that Casey may have some similar demons in common with this mystery kidnapper.""Split"" is more of a psychological thriller than, say, ""The Visit"", and I think that really suits Shyamalan's filmmaking style. He's great at creating an atmosphere of tension and setting up some really creepy scenarios. There is even a sliver of ""real science"" permeating the film that at least tries to ground it in reality a bit. What it all adds up to is a film that is equal parts creepy and fun.That being said, ""Split"" doesn't always make sense or amount to the scale it seems to be built upon. In other words, the setup is significantly better than the climax. Even the traditional ""twist ending"" from Shyamalan, though present here, is of a completely different variety than his usual shenanigans (probably a good thing, though, in all honestly). Like I said, though, ""Split"" is just so much fun to watch as it's rolling along that its shortcomings are usually overshadowed.The acting in ""Split"" also goes into the ""plus"" column. McAvoy is truly a treat (a performance worthy of anything that will be featured at the Oscars), while Taylor-Joy continues to establish herself (after ""The Witch"") as an up-and-coming star.Overall, ""Split"" is the kind of film that epitomizes what Shyamalan is all about. It isn't his peak, but it does showcase his taut, spooky, madcap style of movie-making. It may not hold up to intense scrutiny, but it was one of the most enjoyable, exciting film experiences I've had of late.","

"Split","bob-the-movie-man","28 January 2017","M. Night Shyamalan fizzed into movie consciousness in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense"" which – having rewatched it again recently – still has the power to unnerve and impress even after knowing the famous 'twist'. Since that film and his next, ""Unbreakable"" in 2000, Shyamalan has 'done a bit of an Orson Welles' by never really living up to that early promise. Here with ""Split"" he returns to better form with a psychological thriller that is heavy on the psycho.James McAvoy plays Kevin and Dennis, and Patricia, and Hedwig, and Barry, and Orwell, and Jade, and if the running time permitted another 17 characters. But this is no ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"": McAvoy plays all these varied personalities in the same body. For Kevin suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder, a rare condition where his different schisms not only affect his speech and attitude but also his whole physique. One personality for example is diabetic and needs insulin: all his others are fine.Under the care of MPD specialist Dr Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley, ""Carrie""), Kevin seems to be making good progress. But all is not as it seems. Dennis, one of the more evil of Kevin's personalities, has kidnapped three teens – Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) – and is holding them captive in his home.While Claire and Marcia are good friends, Casey is the wild-card in the pack: a moody and aloof teen that doesn't fit in with the crowd. We see the abduction unfold largely through her intelligent and analytical eyes, with her experiences causing flashbacks to hunting trips in the woods as a five-year-old child with her father and uncle.This is McAvoy's film, with his different personalities being very well observed and the scenes where he switches from one to the other being particularly impressive as piece of acting. Of the youngsters, Anya Taylor-Joy is the most impressive, with the denouement of her particular sub-plot being my favourite part of the film.Shyamalan, who also wrote the script, is treading a well worn cinematic path here (since often the MPD element is the surprise twist, to list any films here inevitably risks major spoilers). But this is a film that seems to have generated a lot of interest, particularly with a younger audience (I have seldom been quizzed more with the ""Ooh, have you seen this yet"" question). As a result this may be a modest sleeper hit.Where I think the movie missteps is in its casting of the three cute and scantily dressed teens as the abductees. From the plot of the film that emerges this appears to be unnecessary and exploitative, especially since they are made to progressively dis-robe as the film progresses. The film would actually have been made more interesting if a family unit, or at least a mixed variety of individuals, had been taken.Unfortunately Shyamalan also over-gilds the lily for the finale by going from medical improbability into outright science fiction: and dilutes what was up to that point a stylish thriller. As a result it's a decent popcorn film, and worth seeing for McAvoy's clever performance, but its not going to go down in my book as a classic.Watch out by the way for a nice final cameo scene: a clever reference to past glories.(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook).","

"Split","billcr12","29 March 2017","James McAvoy is the only reason to watch Split. He is a man with 23 separate and distinct personalities. Three high school girls are abducted from a parking lot in a Pennsylvania town. Kevin(McAvoy) has placed them in a room and appears as a different person with each encounter, including one as a little boy. He also is a regular patient of a college professor, Dr. Fletcher(Betty Buckley), who not only treats him as a client, but uses him in lectures as an example of an extreme multiple personality disorder. The three victims are downright silly and the doctor clueless as to just how dangerous her pet project is to society. His means of financial support are never explained and how he is able to survive and live in some abandoned building with no one seeing him come and go is absurd. M. Night Shyamalan has left too many gaping plot holes here. He uses a flashback involving one of the girls as a small child in the woods with her father and uncle hunting deer. It makes no sense as to the rest of the story. McAvoy is riveting as he transitions from one personality to the next with both voice and body mannerisms that are uncanny. I was impressed with him previously in another movie from Scotland in 2013 which is fairly unknown, Filth. He is hilarious as a corrupt policeman and it is a better film then Split.","

The synopsis really captivated me and I believe the potential of the movie was vast however, Split did not perform up to my expectations. The movie lacks substance and builds towards a supernatural ending of gore and violence.I like how the theme of abused is being highlighted, yet the movie does very little to build upon it.

"Split","AndreVeasey","15 February 2018","I will start off by saying this film was in no way perfect. There were some instances where I wondered what will this all lead to. Many people I hear who dislike the film is because of the personalities being violent. To be honest, the only personalities that are shown to be somewhat violent is Dennis and The Beast. Dennis doesn't do anything violent either. As seen in this film the personalities were actually funny, kind, and artistic however there were events that lead to some personalities believing it what's known as The Beast. The acting by James McAvoy was excellent. The plot was probably the only thing that was a little confusing. This is a great thriller film with some flaws but its entertaining in which I believe the director did good. I'm not anticipating his next film as I am others but I'm interested in seeing his next film.","

"Split","collegedude-37028","27 January 2017","Have you ever been captivated by a trailer and for months looked forward to the advertised film but then when you finally get to see it you are left underwhelmed and disappointed? Unfortunately, that's how I felt about Split, the newest ""thriller"" from director M. Night Shyamalan.I put the word thriller in quotes because I felt that it wasn't a thriller at all, but rather a drama with tense moments.Split tells two stories rather than just one and I think that's what hurt the film the most. The first story we have is Kevin, played by the brilliant James McAvoy, who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder. Kevin suffered a trauma in his past and his brain formed 23 different identities in order to protect itself and a new one is emerging on top of those. Out of the 24 total, we are only shown 8. The 8 that we do see are remarkably well-done and at times rather creepy. The other story we have is Casey, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, who is kidnapped along with her two friends Claire and Marcia and held in captivity by Kevin. We are shown plenty, if not too much, of Casey's past but very little of Kevin's. There's only one minor flashback that gives us a cryptic look at Kevin's childhood but we are given at least five flashbacks of Casey's life. Just to be clear, I'm glad we were shown what Casey's trauma was but I think it could have been approached better. We really didn't need scene after scene to show us that she was a victim. It would have been nice to see more of Kevin's backstory so that we could get a sense of why he is the way he is.James McAvoy's performance was outstanding. It's hard enough to train yourself to embody one character for a role but to embody 8 is something not many can do. If there is a sequel, which I'm sure there will be, I look forward to seeing some of the other identities. Anya also gave an outstanding performance, perfectly displaying what it's like to carry a burden that you feel you can't share with anyone else, not even your closest friends.In conclusion, I feel that the film could have been done better. It was decent, but it wasn't shocking or terrifying like the trailer claims. I will say that the ending is surprising; not a plot twist that so many have claimed it to be, but rather withheld information that has come to light in an intriguing way. I give Split 2 out of 4.","

"Split","LuxuriousWoman","13 March 2017","This was an interesting concept, but writing ruined it. You have a guide with mental illness that caused him to have 23 different personalities. An interesting thing is that people with multiple personalities were able to change their body chemistry. Only one of the personalities needed to take shots, and the strength varied with each personality.The three girls are captured and put in his dungeon like thing. They are constantly trying to think of ways to escape, while the guy is worried about keeping them there and going to his therapy sessions. His therapist is fascinated with how they can change their body chemistry and she wants to keep an eye on him.It sounds so interesting! Then, where did it all go wrong?The characters. The girls are dumb and make many mistakes. They should have teamed up to jump him, but they never think of that. They find a secret way out, only for him to capture the girl that got out and separate her and boarding up the exit. The black girl, or mixed, hit him with a chair and tried to escape only to be captured and separated. Now they are all split up and can't plan together because they didn't work together.The main girl, Kasey/Casey/whatever, ended up tricking his 9 year old personality and called the front desk. She told the guy that she was kidnapped with her friends and the guy though it was a prank. Really? Who would prank someone like that? Also, shouldn't you check just in case it isn't a prank?The main Kasey girl finds a screw and gets out one room that way, but she's in another room that's locked. Kevin's (the main guy) therapist notices something is up and meets up with him. She meets up and excuses herself to use the restroom. She checks a room and sees a kidnapped girl there. Instead of calling the police, she stares in shock and it's enough for Keven to knock her out and put her on the couch. What a failure! The blond one gets inspiration and looks around the room for something to get them out. Shouldn't y'all have done that before? Anyway, the black girl finds a hanger and tries to unlock it from the outside instead of picking the lock. Why? Anyway, Kasey is trying to contact the outside world with his computer, but the internet doesn't work. She watches videos of his different personalities for no reason what so ever. She eventually gets something heavy and starts trying to break the door down. Wouldn't it be better to look for keys or something to pick the lock? Kevin, the main guy, is on a train when he activates the 24th personality, the beast. The beast is super fast and super strong and spells trouble. We go back to the girls and the black girl got the actual lock to the other side and she seems successful, but the beast is already back! The old lady gets back up, but her glasses are gone and she can't see. The best breaks her bones and goes to look for the other girls. Kasey gets the idea to remove the hat and we see the keys are there. Are you kidding me?! She unlocks the door and sees that the lady has been killed and her friends have been eaten. She says the guys full name, and he reverts back for a second, and she finds out that he has a shotgun. Her and the beast face off until the beast realizes that, like him, she has been abused as a child. He leaves her alone and the people rescue her. She gets picked up the the people and we see the guy she called, a black guy, make a face like, ""Oh crap! My bad!"" Yeah idiot, you got three people killed! I hope you're happy with yourself. The girl is to be picked up by her abusive uncle and it ends.This was the most infuriating movie. The black guy could have sent help as soon as he got the call, but he didn't. Now three people died and all he could do was make a ""Oh crap! My bad!"" face. The therapist should have called the police as soon as she saw the girl, but she just stood there. The keys where under the hat the whole time, and Kasey could have saved like 30 minutes by getting the keys. Heck, she could have saved the therapist and her friends by breaking them out 30 minutes early and getting help.","

"Split","MrDHWong","12 April 2017","Split is a psychological thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and starring James McAvoy. While not a complete redemption for Shyamalan's filmmaking credit, it is certainly a step in the right direction.After attending a birthday party, three girls named Casey, Marcia, and Claire are kidnapped by a mysterious man identifying himself as ""Dennis"" (James McAvoy) and are held in a prison-like basement. While trying to escape, the girls discover that ""Dennis"" is actually one of 23 distinct personalities belonging to the man in question, and is conspiring with a fellow personality to aid in the release of a frightening 24th, known only as ""The Beast"".Suspenseful and often chilling, Split feels like a much needed return to form for the once disgraced writer/director. Shyamalan successfully channels the Hitchcockian method of storytelling that was present in his early films. As one would expect, there is a twist ending but unlike Shyamalan's recent duds, this one actually works quite well. James McAvoy gives a frightening, deranged performance as a man suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and he never overacts or hams up the unhinged nature of his character. Shyamalan still has a long way to go before he fully redeems himself of his recent terrible films but if Split is anything to go with, he's definitely on the right track.I rate it 7.5/10","

Anya Taylor Joy is also great here, I believe one day we'll see an Oscar in her future. Betty Buckley(Carrie, Eight is Enough) is great has the doctor trying to help McAvoy. You may think it's a movie about a man with a personality disorder, but it becomes so much more than that. If you like a movie that will keep you on edge, then check Split out.If you are a fan of Shyamalans earlier work, then stay around towards the end, cause he puts one of his earlier films in the same universe with this film, which makes me excited for a sequel.","

Notice I use 'Knight'as I soon expect the Queen of England to be knighting this fellow with some accolades for his contribution film and motion picture innovation.The opening credits are compelling enough to make one think that there is some hope for film's success; as a lot of work was put into the credits, perhaps more so than the body of the film itself. My hopes were soon dashed after the movie feebly got underway after the bold credit telling us who the director was of this fine piece of nonsense.I found myself (more or less tortured) thinking that the movie should get better and that I for once could write something nice to say about this movie and director. Maybe the guy could learn from his past work and improve with his latest artistic foray. But unfortunately that wasn't the case. As this so called movie has finally taught me never to view another Sham-o-lame movie. Oh we, could all say give the guy a break, he's just trying to be artsy- fartsy what have you.

I'm surprised that IMDb number is at 7.4 of 10. Wow... Stunning revelation to the capacity of integrity of movie enthusiasts.Yep, they had to bring in Bruce Willis in at the end for some box office draw like some insurance in case the movie severely bombed, which surprisingly it didn't as the box office business indicates $137 million netted from an estimated $9 million production budget. It just means that we'll see some future crap from this guy.I understand that devout fans of M.

"Split","Vivekmaru45","12 April 2017","I am giving the film a rating of 3 because I have seen two good films by M. Night Shyamalan mainly The Sixth Sense 1999 and Unbreakable 2000. You should add these two films in your movie collection.This film starts off with the abduction of three teenage girls Claire, Marcia, and Casey by an unknown young man(James McAvoy). This man later on, exhibits symptoms of multiple personality disorder towards the young girls. They in turn are scared out of their wits and devise futile attempts at escape, all of which are thwarted. The central character of this film is Wendell Crumb(James McAvoy) who exhibits 23 distinct personalities. There is also a hidden 24th personality which is in fact a demonic entity called ""The Beast"". Wendell has kidnapped these three girls in order that they be sacrificed to The Beast.Though the plot of the film sounds interesting the execution of the film is not. I am a keen horror fan but this film failed to hold my attention. I have seen many good horror films in my life and I can safely say that this film is not among them. You can compare Sixth Sense and Unbreakable which have coherent plots. Mind well that Shyamalan has directed many other films - but I have singled out these two as being his best works. I also want to add the Shyamalan is not in the same league as horror writers Stephen King and Clive Barker.I know that James McAvoy is a thoroughly professional actor, but he has succeeded at making a mockery of all the characters he has portrayed in this film. Just compare the acting of Sir Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence Of The Lambs(1991) and Edward Norton as Aaron in Primal Fear(1996). Other good performances by Mark Harmon as Ted Bundy The Deliberate Stranger (1986), Michael Rooker in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986), Brian Dennehy as John Wayne Gacy in To Catch a Killer (1992) and Billy Bob Thornton as Karl in Sling Blade (1996).

"Split","jeannefrancoise","12 March 2017","Okay so this movie is directed by Shyamalan, the director of some popular horror movies. He is specialized to make audience freaking out. Well in his new movie, Split, Shyamalan tries to combine the sci-fi horror and psychology issue. It is said that the main character here, Kevin, has 23 distinct personalities, from the kindest one, the woman, the sincere child, and so on. But there will be 24th personality about to produce. At first, audience already knew that Kevin is the main character because since beginning he leads the plot. What makes this movie good is that the effects and the places, so dark, so underground, and so ""horror"" with the fringe musics that you could imagine. For me, the plot is quite predictable, but the great acting of James McAvoy will keep your mouth shut up and you will close your eyes in some dramatic scenes that will give you a nightmare if the 24th personality is real in the real life. So that, I appreciate this movie as the new method to explain a psychopath, not just because he/she has bad childhood, but also to see the relation between human and their mind, how they make everything happen beyond logic and how they react it to other people. This horror is not just a horror, but a sci fi also. You watch it first and you will agree with me. Good job, McAvoy!!","

Now, I have 24 reasons to rave about his talent on this platform, too. He became wanted as my future cast member, that's for sure. His facial expressions and his eyes have no limits. His voices and gestures are literally giving you the chills. In the best possible ways, naturally.I wasn't a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work until Split came out. He caught my attention with Unbreakable but I was waiting for something more of my kind to appear. His way of telling stories is like an outsider. He is a witness. But with Split and Glass, he has entered the arena of the wicked. He's playing on our field now.This is a 10 star film, no doubt. From every angle it is a masterpiece. Epic soundtrack by West Thordson! I've been listening to it ever since when I need inspiration to write out one of the dark feathers.Have to mention Anya Taylor-Joy's acting debue in my world, too.

Seriously three people with the kind of stuff lying around could have overcome this guy but Casey never seems to even try.
You wonder if ""Sixth Sense"" was somebody else's idea because nothing after that by Shyamalan has lived up to that. ""The Village"" was also mentioned by Indian writer as a local story Shyamalan had picked up.","

"Split","sanctumlcie","26 April 2017","I give this a three, and that is being generous, because of the acting, and the acting alone. The whole story is a pointless mess, the story is thinner than Kate Moss and is utterly boring from start to finish, not to mention outright predictable. Probably what is the worst thing though, is that they use mental illness as a plot point to scare people, these people are not monsters and are not to be looked at like freaks, it is a severe condition which this film simply sticks the finger to. I've just about had enough of these modern 'thrillers' where the hell are the modern terminators, the blade runners, aliens, Indiana Jones? Hollywood has been sapped of any soul it once had and the whole industry is now just a cash cow, utter disgrace of a movie and wouldn't waste my money watching it! Utter rubbish.","

"Split","david-meldrum","11 July 2022","Everyone says McAvoy is excellent in this, and everybody is right - he really is on top form here, effortlessly carrying the film. If the film would be as exciting or gripping with a less convincing central performance is a moot point; but Shyamalan is certainly in better control of his ideas than he is in his weaker films. We've really got to start doing better, however, than using mental health problems as horror movie shorthand. This film does at least try to do something a little more complex in that regard, but it's still not enough to move beyond 'ill people as scary boogeyman'. It all does just about hang together in a final act that threatens the wrong sort of chaos but never quite delivers it.","

Let me make it short, James McAvoy's best role yet....He knocked it out of the park, you'll know what i mean when you see the movie. Casting is great, especially the performances of Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke & Betty Buckley as Dr. Karen Fletcher are remarkable....West Dylan Thordson score gets extra marks...Great Psychological Horror-Thriller with a powerhouse performance by James McAvoy under the brilliant direction by M. Night Shyamalan, Ofcourse with a twist-ending...Can't wait to see Glass BTW.","

"Split","lmcressia","18 September 2017","The movie wasn't bad, per se. If it was just a movie directed by Average Joe and if the bad guy wasn't superhuman it would probably have been a fine movie. This movie is highly regarded, and I know at least part of my less glowing viewpoint is my expectations.1. M. Night Shyamalan. For some reason I keep expecting amazing things from him. Partially because of The Sixth Sense, and partially because I like the topics he writes about. The Sixth Sense was amazing. I enjoyed Unbreakable a lot more than I probably should have, because of its theme. I think it probably is not nearly as good as I believe it to be. Signs. A very popular film, which made no sense. I read an interview where Shyamalan belittles the reporter for not reading between the lines with Signs, and for taking it at face value. Well, ""M"", if you had written it better perhaps people wouldn't be confused about what was going on. I have not watched it again since reading the article, so it may improve my opinion of the movie -- it would almost have to. The Village. This movie was awful. dreadful. unwatchable. Please, do not watch this movie. 2. Twists. I expect twists from all his movies. This may not be fair, although apparently they all have twists, they are just often so obscure no one notices them. Apparently Signs had a twist. I will have to watch again to see if it really is. The Village had a twist, although I knew what it was after a mere 4 minutes, which made the rest of the movie hard to watch. I kept hoping I would be wrong and something interesting would be going on. But that was not the case. Split may have had two twists. 1. The main character is a ""cutter"". That's not much of a twist, and the word on the street is that wasn't the main twist. The main twist was the last scene setting up an Unbreakable/Split sequel. Twist. That's not actually a twist... that's just a thing that happened. The movies was entertaining and suspenseful. The characters were interesting. But ""The Horde's"" metamorphosis is a little much to handle. And most everyone being killed was a little more sad than it needed to be. Perhaps I misunderstood what was going on, for which I expecting a condescending note from Shyamalan, but did they send the main character back to an abusive relationship with her uncle at the end? Did that really happen? Did she go from one monster to another? That is a hideous ending. Did I get that right? I hope not, but that what it seemed like.","

"Split","Prismark10","8 April 2017","M Night Shyamalan's Split starts with three teenage girls being kidnapped by Kevin (James McAvoy) who traps them in a dungeon of some kind. The girls do plot to escape but get caught, they discover that Kevin has multiple personalities although only a few tend to emerge more regularly. However Kevin seems to be on the verge of the creation of a more beastlier manifestation.One of the kidnapped girl's Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) seems to be more competent with her survivalist instincts due to how she was bought up which we find out in flashbacks. Meanwhile Kevin has been in the care of a renowned psychiatrist who seems to be concerned about him and investigates further.Shyamalan hints at a universe shown in his previous film Unbreakable, where a person could elevate to a different level of being. He is helped by a stellar performance by McAvoy who does struggle to show all 23 personalities.In its heart though it is still 'girls that are kidnapped and held in a dungeon film' and frankly they tend to be two a penny in any given month. Despite the split personality gimmick the film was not that innovative or interesting and derivative of films like Silence of the Lambs.","

 original so I was very skeptical when I saw this movie has 7.5 ..and I 
 was right !!! .... this movie could have ended in 5 minutes. 3 girls 
 facing an average size unarmed guy with mental illness but they decided 
 to do nothing ... not even a punch or a kick but only crying. The room 
 they were locked in had many things which could have been used as a 
 weapon ... i.e the shower curtain rod, the sink, or even their shoes 
 which one of them used to dig a hole in the ceiling, but of course 
 not... also none of them thought of hiding behind the door and attack 
 him from behind when he opens it. Indian movies usually are long and I 
 guess Mr.Shyamalan could not forget his origins, so he tried his best 
 to extend his 5 mins story to almost 2 hours movie. Save your time and 
 money and go stare at an empty wall which will be more exciting than

It kind of felt like a Freshman in a high school drama class wrote this movie and it was it first attempt at a movie. There wasn't any great twist or surprise that you find yourself waiting on the entire movie. Everything was as it appeared and that made for a lot of disappointment. The last 20 seconds of the movie did give me hope that if there's a sequel, it will be much better. As for this one.. if you see it on a late night cable station or Netflix, it is mildly entertaining but don't pay money for this at the theater. You'll likely be sorry you did.","

"Split","Troy_Campbell","1 February 2017","The double whammy of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable saw filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan ascend to the throne as the master of twists. Yet after delivering a string of debacles (The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth) his title was lost, seemingly forever. Thanks to a career shakeup—involving collaboration with super successful low-budget producer Jason Blumhouse (Paranormal Activity, The Purge)—Shyamalan has announced his return to form with this creepy psychological thriller. Creating an atmosphere of dread via constant tension building and a genuinely unpredictable narrative, Shyamalan is back to his old tricks of misdirection, rug-pulling and Kafka-esque storytelling. Opening with the kidnapping of three teenage girls in an utterly unnerving sequence, the tale unravels to explore the complicated lives of both abductee Casey (Anna Taylor Joy) and split-personality abductor Kevin (James McAvoy). Or is it Barry? Or Patricia? Chewing the scenery with aplomb, McAvoy delights in a role that allows him to segue between an obsessive compulsive weirdo, a frightfully stern mother-figure, a whimsical (and hilarious) 9 year old, and, in the final act, something else entirely. There are undoubtedly flaws—an underwhelming and frustratingly ambiguous climax for example—in addition to a few nonsensical genre tropes, but the film's tempo and energy diminishes the negative effects of these missteps. Possibly a transcendent movie short of regaining his old position amongst Hollywood royalty, Split is nevertheless an exciting and gratifying thriller that continues the Shyamalanaissance.","

"Split","lee_eisenberg","30 April 2017","M. Night Shyamalan made a splash in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense"", but aside from ""Unbreakable"", most of his movies since then haven't been anything to brag about (""The Happening"" would've been perfect for ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""). ""Split"" turns out to be a pretty interesting movie, as James McAvoy's character - suffering from dissociative personality disorder - holds three teenage girls hostage and they meet his multiple personalities.I'm not a psychologist, so I can neither confirm nor refute the movie's depiction of the main character. But I did like what the psychologist (Betty Buckley, who played the gym teacher in the original ""Carrie"") said. I wonder if this will interest more people in the topic. Whether or not it does, I still find this to be Shyamalan's most interesting movie of the past decade. And there just might be a little surprise at the end.","

"Split","harry_tk_yung","22 January 2017","A psychopath (term used in a very general and imprecise sense) kidnapping a bunch of girls is a not a novel plot. Morgan Freeman's ""Kiss the girls"" (1997) is one that comes to mind right away. But while in that movie there is only one kidnapper, here in ""Split"", there are 23, as if you still haven't heard, occupying the same body. But obviously, we will not be shown all of them. In addition to the original personality that had suffered certain childhood tremor, we see a woman, a 9-year old child, an assertive schemer, an artistic homosexual and ""the beast"", among others.Ever since ""Sixth sense"" (1999) Night M. Night Shyamalan has made numerous attempts but has not been able to repeat that feat. ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" all had something to offer in the department of finale twist, although a far cry from ""Sixth sense"". ""Lady in the water"" is a let-down. Personally, I like ""The happening"" although I am quite aware that this view is not generally shared. ""The Last Airbender"" appeared to be his final abandonment of his signature genre and hence a total disappointment. I am therefore delighted to see that there is a certain degree of his return to form in ""Split"", in masterful handling of thrill and suspense, even if not in devising clever twists.""Split"" is not a convoluted contrivance. The narrative is orderly, told essentially through omniscient narration granted the audience via the POV of a number of characters.The motive for the kidnapping is not entirely clear. Two have been offered. On a simpler plain, one of the 23 personalities enjoys watching sexy girls dancing. On a subtler plain, everything is under the ultimate control of ""the beast"" who wants to collect innocent girls who have never seen any vicissitudes for some ominous, dark purposes. The three kidnapped is just a start.After Anthony Perkins, James McAvoy is arguably among the best actors in this generation to play this multi-split-personality protagonist. This he has demonstrated convincingly, switching seamlessly from one personality to another right under the unforgiving scrutiny of the close-up camera. Anya Taylor-Joy, in what is closest to the lead female role here, shows her worth acting opposite McAvoy. Playing the kidnapped girl who had a childhood tremor just as bad as the protagonist's, Taylor-Joy captures the audience's imagination in a scene with a devious attempt to trick the 9-year-old personality into helping them escape. Also excellent is Betty Buckley as the protagonist's doctor who is, among other things, a sort of surrogate VO explaining the details of his case. ""Split"" to-date has earned an average 7.7 score from IMDb users, as well as generally favourable critic reviews.","

And I am glad I didn't read anything about the movie, or watched trailers or read reviews. So, my opinion is purely mine.I have to say that the movie totally got me by surprise. I was expecting something shallow and interesting, but instead, the story is much more complicated and deep, and could be seen again (which I plan to do with my husband). I think what touched me the most was the ending, when the Beast spoke to the girl in the prison cell, before he left her untouched.That moment really touched me because of my own difficult past, and I can relate to both characters. At times, when you think you are too broken, you need a bit of comfort that you are not a complete castaway from society, because certain things happened in your past, which were not in your control.I believe there will be people to relate to the characters just like I did, and will understand what I mean.A really powerful movie, at least for me!

"Split","arsenico71","17 May 2017","...which goes on about this movie. I liked it greatly. The suspense starts within a few minutes from the beginning, and never releases its grip until the final demise. The mean actor is absolutely great in his performance, playing 8 different personalities was not an easy task, and he did accomplish it with awesome skill. The setting of the story is totally creepy and perfectly fit for the character and the tale that is told, the soundtrack is carefully chosen to masterfully accompany the gloomy, sick atmosphere, and what about the story itself? It has a few minor flaws, but it works more than fine, and reading other reviews I notice that many didn't get important details. Casey's flashbacks, which many have deemed useless to the story, are instead a key element in the lunatic's final attitude towards her, and his seemingly unrealistic transformation (the most impressive one, I'm not going to say more in order not to spoil anything) is justified many times in the course of the movie by the description of how different personalities in one single person can have each their own physical peculiarities (such as illnesses etc.) which the others have not. Sure, the transformation itself a bit exaggerated, but the sense remains the same. And anyway, hey, it's a movie! You're expected to apply a certain amount of suspension of disbelief. Otherwise, just watch documentaries.As in just any horror/thriller movie, there's a few ""I-have-to-act- stupid-in-order-to-keep-the-movie-going"" moments, but those are to be expected, and don't take anything away from the enjoyment anyway.All in all, this is a very good movie in my opinion. If you like thick suspense and psychological twists, just watch it and you will enjoy it.","

Night Shyamalan just remember when his movies were top notch (You know before his head got too swollen with the village) In order to be real excited about the overall plot, an overall concept that's catered to Shyamalan's universe.But even without his well known twist, Split was a stunning movie that relied on the power of McAvoy's great acting.

"Split","matthewssilverhammer","26 January 2017","Few directors inspire more intense reactions than Shyamalan. Starting out on the highest-of-highs (Sixth Sense) before steadily falling to the lowest-of-lows (Happening), his career wasn't so much a roller coaster as a log-flume-drop with seemingly no end. So while 2014's Visit was a nice rise back to quality, Split is a true return. A bold, original vision that hearkens his earlier work; a fascinating mixture of drama, horror and psychological world-building. Following the recent trend of ""kidnapped-and-trapped-with-a-crazy-man"" (10 Cloverfield Lane, Room), a trio of teenage girls are captured by a disturbed man (McAvoy) with 23 different split personalities. It's clear Shyamalan did extensive research, as the attention to and mentions of real-life disorder case studies is impressive. McAvoy's giant performance had every chance to be obnoxiously overacted, yet his commitment and intrigue ultimately wins each scene. His moments with his psycho-therapist are intuitive and curious, with an underpinning of unknown menace, as it all leads to an emotionally difficult message about handling and living with trauma. On top of all this, Split's ending surprise, a trademark of Shyamalan's, may be his best and most satisfying since The Sixth Sense. Still, even with all the good in Shyamalan's, he still has his hang-ups, many of which are on display here. For all the powerful horror visuals, ominously toned pacing, and humor that wonderfully walks the line between funny and disturbing, his direction makes the performances feel fairly unnatural, and his dialogue is sometimes oddly stilted and explicitly expositional. Despite the messiness and weak script moments, Split is an enveloping psychological thriller whose yarn is dutifully weaved with darkness and intrigue.","

That ended when he made The Happening and then even worse, The Last Airbender. I thought The Visit was a nice reminder that he could bring forth an entertainingly thrilling film. I was hoping Split would give me the satisfaction of being comparable to M Nights' glory days but I am sad to say I am disappointed.The film is about three teenage girls who are unexpectedly kidnapped in a parking lot by a mentally ill man with dissociative identity disorder. He has 23 different personalities and a 24th called the beast which seems to be the most threatening of them all. The hype for this one seemed to be real and I heard many raving about it but I didn't have fun during this film.I know many won't agree with some of my criticisms but I wish I could have liked this more.First of all the film should have been shorter. There were areas of the film that dragged. M Night was trying to build tense moments , a lot of which I felt fell short and were worn out. I have a background in psychology and know of dissociative identity disorder but am certain that a lot of the elements of it were fantastical. Too many personalities and that final form stuff just doesn't gel well and borders on silly. Not to mention the shift between characters feels incoherent at times. Saying all that I have to say that James McAvoy is absolutely superb in this. Like so alluringly good. I'm glad an actor of his caliber was able to showcase his range and ability although I wish the film was written better.The transpiring of some of the events were so stupid. There are a few plot holes but I couldn't ever really sit back and enjoy the film. The three actresses did a decent job, Anya Taylor-Joy will certainly become a big name but I have a hard time getting over the implausibility and the buildup to the final act. I don't want to say anything that will spoil it for other viewers but the ending is pretty cool and a nice callback to a time where M Night was on top of his craft.6/10","

McAvoy shows the world what acting is like, by breathing a unique personality into each and every one of them his character possesses. From the inflection of his voice, to the accent, right down to the body language, you recognize each personality with ease. The most fierce of his personalities is known as the beast, and the beast enjoys killing. Central to the story is the three young women that are captured and held hostage awaiting the beast to come and destroy them.This movie is very much a thinking man's movie, with a superhero/villain subplot.

With an epidemic of cutting by teenagers in our society, this remark was to say the least, troubling. As a therapist, I was appalled by Betty Buckley's character visiting her client at his home and then making the statement that ""her patients were her family"". If you're going to portray a therapist in a movie, that profession's code of conduct needs to be represented correctly.

"Split","kikoydaba3","26 August 2019","Impressive performances from James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy carry Split in a thrilling film about a psychopathic killer and childhood trauma.Split revolves around two main characters, Kevin and Casey, who suffer from childhood trauma which the film explores. Kevin developed his multiple personalities to cope from abuse by his mother and loss of father. He abducts three young women which includes Marcia and Claire. The film gradually reveals that the multiple personalities are distinct and fight for each others turn on ""the light"". The narrative is further driven by a yet not shown 24th personality, named the Beast, who commanded the other personalities to abduct the women as his food. Casey being abducted is designed for her to grow from the trauma caused by the sexual abuse by her uncle which is revealed through flashback scenes. Another subplot is Dr. Fletcher's, played by Betty Buckley, attempt to heal Kevin.The arc or Dr. Fletcher trying to heal Kevin bogged down the pacing which should have been strictly focused on Kevin and Casey. Scenes with an adult Casey and her uncle implying continued abuse should have been presented, not just on her childhood experiences. A clear resolution to both Kevin and Casey is not fully grasped because their trauma is different. Kevin is shown to be abused, but is not shown specifically how. For Casey, her ending should have been a proper breakup with her uncle signifying character growth. The camera work is impressive in some shots but not all. Angles are good but not the lighting which takes away some of the claustrophobic feel of the film.Nevertheless, McAvoy and Taylor-Joy are spectacular and carry the film on acting alone. McAvoy's personality switching is fluid and shows his ability to be a chameleon. Taylor-Joy is able to portray a layered performance simultaneously dealing with sexual abuse and the possibility of reoccurring in another form.7/10","

"Split","virindra","29 January 2017","Besides of his ridiculous middle name I am a huge fan of Mr. Night Shyamalan's (Manoj's) movies. Especially Unbreakable was awesome. I had to see this collaboration between Shyamalan and McAvoy in the cinemas.I heard so many negative sounds about this movie. They were not really about the movie, but about Mr. Night. I don't understand. In their eyes Manoj can't do anything right anymore. So their judgment is already made based on the director. That does not make any sense. Manoj said in an interview that some people don't like his signature by being a small part of his own movies as an actor. That is what I do like about him. Why would the suit fit Stan Lee and not Manoj? Manoj makes me proud to be an Indian and writer of a thriller novel as well.Split is a very thrilling movie. I was on the edge of my seat all the time. I did not want to miss a second of the movie. The end scene was amazing. The acting of McAvoy is phenomenal. The script is not predictable. This is a worthy movie in the resume of Manoj. I wish him all the luck to surpass the greatness of this movie. The woman I went to see this movie with said; ""This is more than a movie, this is art."" I totally agree.","

"Split","lesleyharris30","24 February 2017","Split is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a very tense, thrilling film as we follow three girls who have been kidnapped by a man with a serious case of schizophrenia. It kept me at the edge of my seat throughout as we follow these girls struggling to escape and being forced to deal with his many different personalities.The only thing about the movie that did bother me a little was false advertising. It was marketed that this man had 23 personalities and that he was unleashing his 24th. However, we only ever meet eight of them, so it is simply a disappointment for the audience who were expecting three times more than that. I understand that Shyamalan has plans to bring this character back, but it still should not have been advertised as such. Although, I must say, you do not walk out feeling underwhelmed by the amount of characters James McAvoy transforms in to throughout. He is phenomenal in this role, delivering each character with clear, specific detail. He blew my mind in every part, playing a convincing nine year old boy, woman and even an animal. There was nothing pantomime about his performances, he lets out a presence that truly becomes these characters, no acting, simply being. It is a very intense ride, one of M. Night Shyamalan's best work in years. Edge of your seat suspense and ridiculously well acted, Split is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good thriller. Three girls must try and escape the clutches of a deranged man who has multiple personalities. Best Performance: James McAvoy","

"Split","duckyisabelle","22 January 2017","I have to admit the concept behind this film hooked me but everything went downhill once it started playing in the cinema. From the horrendous, laughable acting by the three female victims (I often found it hard to believe the three of them were supposed to be terrified prisoners with their perfect makeup and unrealistic screaming scenes) to the obligatory 'plot twist' at the end, I felt like walking out of the theater multiple times during the movie. The only scenes which redeemed the movie were the interesting exchanges between 'Kevin' and the psychologist (props to the both of them for their decent performances) and I couldn't help cringing each time one of the girls made an appearance. It was sad the three of them had as much screen time as they had.Also, DID is a serious issue and yet, Kevin's dialogue was often cringe-worthy, prompting hysterical laughter from people in the cinema. It made it hard for me to think of this movie seriously. Even when Kevin finally transformed into the Beast and began crawling on walls, I was so numb from all the cringe-worthy dialogue and weak plot that I was no longer shocked at this entirely unrealistic 'plot twist'. Perhpas, James McAvoy should have just stuck to playing Charles Xavier if he wanted to be a superhero that badly.","

"Split","Rayve777","22 August 2023","Split is a really great movie, such a breath of fresh air from the sea of inconsistent, infuriating mediocrity that has plagued Shyamalan since Signs. While everyone's acting is quite great throughout, James McAvoy easily steals the show, being able to effortlesslessly making them all feel believable in the same performance.The cinematography is excellent as well, portraying the claustrophobia that the 3 captive girls feel as well as revealing information to the audience about DID sufferer Kevin in clever ways.The theme of how trauma is passed down from childhood abuse and how it affects our behavior as adults I feel will be no doubt controversial to anyone watching Split, but I believe that Shyamalan handles this very sensitive topic with care and tact. Both Kevin and Casey, one of his captives, suffered from intense childhood abuse which shaped some antisocial behavior in them later on in life, but what separates them from each other is that Casey tries to help the other captives survive and escape. Kevin (or rather Kevin's other personalities), however, embraces the philosophy of ""The Beast"", who believes that those who have not suffered like he has are ""impure"" and must be purged from the world.Split proves that Shyamalan can easily still make films that are both thought-provoking and high quality, and it's for films like these that I still root for him and want to see him succeed.","

Anya Taylor Joy shows why she is all the rage right now.There's also lots of great supporting performances and basic filmmaking.However, these can't save the movie from its ludicrous plot. I spent a lot of time saying really? Are you serious? Shyamalan does what he does in most of his recent films - tries to make a nuanced project but then tries to dumb it down for the masses. Simply put, you can't have it both ways. The result is poor exposition and over explanation. He needs to trust his audience, not condescend to them.","

"Split","deloudelouvain","25 April 2017","I really enjoyed watching this movie. James McAvoy does a brilliant job playing the different personalities he has. The main character suffers from Disociated Identity Disorder and has twenty three different personalities. You only get to see about eight different personalities but they are all great to watch and add the necessary suspense for this movie. Some personalities are harmless and others are dangerous, and that's what makes it interesting to watch because the girls that have been kidnapped try to figure out who they could trust to get out of their imprisonment. Anya Taylor-Joy does also a great job playing one of the kidnapped girls, while she had herself suffered of traumatic events in her life. Some reviewers will tell you that people that suffer from D.I.D. are not violent or whatever but it doesn't matter because they just don't get the point that this is a movie. It's not real folks, so get over it that not everything is accurate in a movie. I thought the movie was better then a lot of other movies in the same genre so it deserves a higher rating.","

"Split","lavatch","18 May 2017","The films of M. Night Shyamalan typically exploit the supernatural in order to develop a suspenseful story with well-rounded characters. Unfortunately, ""Split"" relies primarily on pop psychology to explore a troubled man's multiple personalities in what is called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). The wildly speculative case study in the film includes one personality type that should be placed in a cage and out of harm of any bystanders.The bystanders who come in the way of Kevin Wendell Crumb, who has a habit of ending his sentences with the expression ""etcetera.,"" are three young women who are improbably kidnapped and held hostage by Kevin, etc. The one character who is more interesting that all of the characters rolled into Kevin, etc. is the young loner Casey Cooke. As developed in lurid detail through flashbacks, little Casey was an abused child who has learned to cope with her pedophile tormentor, Uncle John. Her survival skills will be put to the test by Kevin, etc.A kindly psychiatrist (well performed by stage actress Betty Buckley) badly underestimates the capabilities of her patient. She deludes herself into believing that she has some control over the wide-ranging behavior of Kevin, etc. Her fatal mistake is to pay a visit to his home. The alert viewer will surely recognize that her fate is sealed when she arrives at his odd living quarters, which turn out to be the sub-basement of the Philadelphia zoo.SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: M. Night Shyamalan's original ending for the film appears as an outtake in the DVD version of ""Split."" Curiously, the director changed the ending because he felt the original version was too dark. The deleted scene was to have Kevin seated atop a building decrying how unfortunate it was that most people go about their lives in an un-split manner, as opposed his subjective realities of multiple personalities. But in a film that is so unpleasant from the outset, it was difficult to see how changing the final scene could possibly have made the film any less depressing than it already was.","

"Split","wackywhovian11","21 May 2017","Boring piece of crap. You'd think a film with a main character who has 23 personalities would be interesting...well it wasn't. Now I saw this film from Redbox for like a dollar so that's the best way to watch it.Another disappointment from M Night. Why does Hollywood keep giving this dude money to make movies? I swear and the film made what 137million at the Box Office? OMG their idiots why didn't they wait until Redbox save a buck.Anyway I thought this film was just lame and a waste of time. The acting wasn't very good. James McAvoy was okay I guess but if he should have developed the characters of the 23 personalities which we only saw 8 on screen a bit more instead of just changing his voice.Oh the main actress what was the point of her flashbacks in the film? They didn't mean anything or bring anything to the story. Oh the girls were idiots. They had so many opportunities to escapes on so many occasions but didn't use em because their DUMB. Being a girl I didn't feel bad for the girls. Okay if you watched the trailer this isn't a spoiler you see the two girls in the back texting on their phone not paying attention and the main girl in the front seat looking like a zombie not paying attention and the dude gets in the cars and they don't notice him until he puts on his mask. Umm if a dude is in your car in a mask you might want to scream or do something but they just say ""Excuse me I think you have the wrong car."" Umm ya think? Oh and the girl in the front seat she watches him spray the other girls in the face. Umm you could have ran away while he was doing that...idiot.Basically this film is junk. I'm always fooled by M Night's film The Visit, The Happening and The Visit just to name a few. Signs and Sixth Sense are ONLY best movie. I've stopped going to his films in theaters because I'm always disappointed except with Signs or Sixth Sense now those are great. And the whole Unbreakable thing who cares. I saw that film it was cool but to tie that film to this garbage was not needed.Should you watch this film. I guess if you really want to. But trust me when I say it was boring and a piece of crap. It's only a dollar and some change at Redbox so if you really really really want to see it, rent it. But you've been warn that it's not good at all.","

I love and hate his films. This film goes In the love section though.The positivesThis film sends an Important message about suffering. This film In some ways relates to me. The main character of ""Casey"" Is relatable due to past experiences In my life and It's great how this film sends a message on how suffering Is how someone becomes a real human being. It's a great message to send through such a great concept. The dialogue of the film Is great. No line feels weird and out of place and In some ways It's quotable. The performances of this film Is amazing. ""James McAvoy"" gives not only a career best performance but also one of the best movie performances I've ever seen. Trying to play different characters Is hard and ""McAvoy"" knocks It out of the park. ""Anya Taylor-Joy"" Is amazing as always. The other actresses I've never heard of till this also won me over too.

There's many long takes and great cinematography throughout the film which makes the film amazing to look at.The negativesThe only flaw I have Is the final scene. It Is a twist as always and I did not expect It. But It felt really forced. There was never really a need to continue this story as It ends on a satisfying note, but the twist just felt like tiring sequel bait.ConclusionApart from It's final scene, ""Split"" Is fantastic. It's amazing premise and writing, the message It sends, career best performances, a consistent creepy tone and amazing camerawork make this one of ""Shyamalan"" best movies.I'm going to give ""Split"" a:9/10.","

"Split","chrichtonsworld","31 January 2017","The second film in a short while where M. Night Shyamalan successfully has managed to scare the living hell out of us. The previous being The Visit of course.Now I know that there have been quite a few thrillers that make use of the Dissociative identity disorder or multiple personality disorder (MPD) and that at this point there is very little that can be done to truly surprise you. But by god M. Night has succeeded in a way that will put you on the edge of your seat multiple times. Not all the time mind you since the film dials down a few notches a couple of times. And this could make it seem the film drags here and there. In hindsight though it was M. Night teaching us what a master of horror he truly can be since he plays around with the tension to keep your interest peaked. Trust me on this that even when some of the plot developments may appear predictable it goes into different directions entirely. Especially at the very end of the film since it gives us a twist that is so meta that it will make your head spin. Very daring and incredibly effective. It is like he is saying, I told you that I am still very much on top of my game. But aside from this, the film in itself is incredible brilliant. James McAvoy was having a blast and he shows us what an amazing actor he is by switching up personalities like it's nothing. Still I do have to remark that Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke made a good impression as well. I did not even recognize her as she also was in The Witch.Split is one of those movies that does a lot of things really good and has you singing praise right after. But of course there will always be people hating on this film just because Shyamalan is involved. He does tend to make films that require you to suspend disbelief and have somewhat of an imagination. Doesn't always mean you have to like or agree with his vision because I am pretty aware he can make terrible films as well. Still Split is certainly is one of his better ones and deserves to be watched by many. So go forth ladies and gentlemen and enjoy yourselves. I certainly did!","

This film plays more like a 5th grader with film school ambitions who sent a script to Mr Shyamalan and it just got made. It's unoriginal, on the nose, and worst of all, boring. I realize there is a whole new audience of people out there and we can not keep raging on about old films, but when we have the Hannibal films and the magnificent series both with the character Francis Dolarhyde, a pretty recent The room and the immortal performance of Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman in American psycho, this just seems as a waste of time. Go watch previously named titles, hell, go watch Seven, and you'll be much better off. 2016 was a disaster of a year regarding films, this is no exception.","

"Split","jasontheterrible","18 January 2017","One needs to be a fan of James McAvoy to fully enjoy this film which I am not. I also rarely watch films so absorbed with one primary actor or ""character(s)"" but this one did win me over. First of all the film score matched up well with the scenes adding the right evocation or emotion. It got better and better as the tension increased. The acting of McAvoy is engrossing, there is no doubt about it. The first half can be at times very grating as drama because the characters keep making wrong decisions. This usually puts me off of a film but it got me back during the last 30 minutes. The story and symbolism is reminiscent of ""Manhunter"" by Michael Mann which was re-made as ""Red Dragon."" Only this one by Shyamalan added quite an interesting new element which is actually supported by much literature. Some will think it borders on the esoteric but the lines are fuzzy. As far as the naysayers who invalidate MPD or DID there is very convincing data that the physical changes are immediate and not faked having been observed in many young children. The transformations are as real as spontaneous remission.My only criticism is the moral ambiguity. In the end losses come because of the superior and experienced, nuanced analysis of the sickness instead of immediate and hostile action. The losers were right about what should have been done from the very beginning.","

"Split","moviexclusive","19 January 2017","If you've seen the trailer, you'll know the surprisingly clear premise of Split - the latest film from M. Night Shyamalan. A mysterious man kidnaps three girls and traps them in an unknown location. As they struggle to escape, it would seem that he has accomplices - except it turns out, ""they"" are him. It's all him.James McAvoy is Kevin, the kidnapper who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). We start the film when he is controlled by the stern and OCD-inflicted ""Dennis"", kidnapping Casey (Anya Taylor- Joy), Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) for a mysterious reason, with his companion personalities, ""Ms Patricia"" and ""Hedwig"". Together, they are considered ""the Horde""; three of twenty-three personalities taking turns to be ""in the light"" inside Kevin. This only turns more disturbing, as words like ""The Beast"" and ""sacred food"" are whispered by the trio, and the girls, naturally panic-stricken, work towards finding their way out of their jail.It would seem that thirteen is a lucky number for Shyamalan. The 2015 The Visit was his return to form after a string of embarrassing work. He's always been a good explorer, asking what-ifs that turn subject matter on their heads, ending them with his signature plot twists. After realising this became his Achilles Heel, he has reinvented himself with a refreshed formula, and Split would reinforce that he is succeeding.With his latest film, he comes at you three ways - the obvious plot of the girls being abducted by a trio of cultish personas that wants to somehow use them to release ""the beast"". The second is Casey's story, that runs parallel in the form of flashbacks, slowly unfurling the reason behind this youth's unusual behaviour. This explains not only her aloof and uncooperative nature, but also her worldly and calculated maneuvers, relative to the other two girls who are more impulsive.It is the last that rattles the most, and it lies in the hands of both slayer and savior - the beast's doctrine that ""those who have not suffered are impure"" and Kevin's therapist, Dr. Fletcher (Betty Buckley), who theorised that those suffering from DID are not lesser human beings with damaged minds, but evolved greater beings, with sometimes supernatural traits. Weaving these three arcs seamlessly into Split is a testament to Shyamalan's persistent skill.McAvoy is a notable actor, with enough fluidity to make for a fascinating Kevin. As ""Dennis"", he is sombre and uptight, crunching brows and fidgeting with object placements. ""Ms. Patricia"" comes along and he turns poised and deliberate, with arched eyebrows and tightened lips, holding back her delicious secrets. ""Hedwig"" is the attention-seeking nine-year-old, who we slowly find out has managed to steal ""the light"" from ""Barry"" - the usual benign controller of Kevin.McAvoy does an admirable job, shifting nuances between the personas. But maybe his recent appearances as the bald Charles Xavier has grown too ingrained, and Kevin's transformations, though laudable, are not as defined as they should be. And though interesting to watch, and sometimes terrifying to decipher (as to who's in charge), the mental patient he plays does feel cliché and a bit of a caricature. Maybe Joaquin Phoenix (Shyamalan's original choice) would have fared better? Unfortunately, we'll never know.Though the early scenes of escape were tense and exciting, the ones with Dr. Fletcher made for some of the most engaging watch. Although therapists are roles that tend to be relegated to help with exposition, Fletcher serves to be an equal and compassionate player in the hide-and-seek game, where she susses out who the controller might be. As she figures out that her theory might be more terrifying true than she expected, the audience follows her through her mortification.Anna Taylor-Joy was a riveting victim. Her startling fragility and angst as Casey gives the movie its most moving moments. Her quick- thinking and measured moves reveals a survivor honed by the past, and as we get fed her history, we become thankful for it, and yet in the most conflicted of ways. Her ending scene and that withering look has us knowing that she's in for more terrifying stories to run from, and proves to be the most disturbing takeaway of all.Shyamalan remains a great storyteller, reinforcing the main plot with small vignettes of charm and wit. In the scenes where ""Dennis"" masquerades as ""Barry"", he makes himself overly effete, and over- populates his speech with fashion trivia, when ""Barry"" was nothing like that, revealing stereotypes even among personas. In another snippet, as Fletcher shares her theory with her elderly neighbour, and calls her patients superior human beings, the old lady rejects her proposal, calling it rubbish, before picking up her phone having succumbed to an infomercial.Split is so many things, and served up by the skillful editing of Luke Clarrocchi and the magnificently atmospheric score by West Dylan Thordson which swings overhead like a metallic guillotine, explores and represents this old adage the best - whatever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.","

James McAvoy give us a brilliance and jaw-dropping performance as the highly disturbed man with a diagnosed 23 distinct personalities that the idea itself is so refreshing and intriguing to see after countless bad horror movie or sequels that no one ask.The character is so complex when he has to change personalities every time from a little kid to a man with OCD Symptoms to a nice middle age woman and finally The Beast.The idea may seem extreme and not convincing at all but seeing James facial expression,the way he talk or movement to match each character make me totally buying it.The rest of the cast did a very good job with the material their handle especially young actress Anya Taylor-Joy who one again impress me with the character Casey Cooke a lonely girl also have a disturbing past so her chemistry on screen with James McAvoy is so thrilling and interesting to watch.The part that i say too good is not only the shocking final part when she face off with The Beast but also the ballsy of director M.

"Split","fredrikgunerius","11 August 2023","When M. Night Shyamalan has been at his most creative and fired on all cylinders, it has resulted in some of the most inspired thrillers of the past two decades: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs and The Village. In Split he is at it again, with a story that is as clever as it is preposterous, about a man with 23 different personalities, played with wonderful playfulness by James McAvoy. The first part of Split is also the best, as Shyamalan evokes an eerie atmosphere around the kidnapping of three teenage girls and the subsequent introduction of the kidnapper and his alter egos. Shyamalan demonstrates clever screenwriting as layer after layer of the onion is peeled and we get to know the McAvoy character more and more. Much of the key to understanding him comes through his scenes with Betty Buckley as his psychologist, and as in Shyamalan's best films, the tension and suspense rises to vibrating levels as we approach the turning point. Unfortunately, the film's effect is somewhat diminished by the realization of McAvoy's final personality, ""The Beast"", which could and should have been held on a tad more realistic level to avoid the cliched and largely ineffectual movie-monster-feel. Fans of Shyamalan may also like the cameo of Mr. Glass towards the end, with all the anticipation his appearance creates. Let's just hope the teaming of Kevin Wendell Crumb and Mr. Glass will become more fruitful than Superman vs. Batman.","

Kevin Wendell Crumb(James McAvoy) has 23 vastly different personalities, living inside him. One of these personalities, kidnap three girls namely, Casey Cooke(Anya Taylor-Joy), Claire Benoit(Haley Lu Richardson) & Marcia(Jessica Sula). Casey, Claire & Marcia have to figure out what Kevin wants with them & escape, before the appearance of a terrifying 24th personality. Split is a mind blowing film. Director M. Night Shyamalan delivers another unforgettable thriller, after The Visit(2015). Shyamalan's original script is one of a kind & maintains the suspense & tension, throughout the movie. You just cannot predict what Kevin is going to do next. The performances are the highlight of the film. James McAvoy has given the best performance of his career so far, as Dennis/Patricia/Hedwig/The Beast/Kevin Wendell Crumb/Barry/Orwell/Jade. McAvoy alters his speech, gait & mannerisms for each personality, with ease & panache. Not even one personality feels like a rehash of another. James McAvoy astoundingly portrays a man suffering from DID. Anya Taylor-Joy is spectacular as Casey Cooke. Betty Buckley is superb as Dr. Karen Fletcher. Haley Lu Richardson is great as Claire Benoit. Jessica Sula is brilliant as Marcia. Izzie Coffey is outstanding as Five-Year-Old Casey. Brad William Henke, Sebastian Arcelus & Neal Huff are impressive as Uncle John, Casey's Father & Mr. Benoit, respectively. Split is a must watch for psychological thriller fans. Also, I recommend everyone to watch it for its sheer unpredictability & the performance of a lifetime by James McAvoy.","

"Split","RussHog","5 February 2017","Split is a strange movie - and one that probably is not entirely advertised appropriately - which may have led to some of the negative feedback. Split is not a horror film - it is more of a mystery thriller but it also a character study in the rise of an evil villain.The movie is about a man who has split personalities - and one of them may or may not be a supernatural force that seeks to unleash chaos. To find out of this supernatural force is real - he kidnaps three women and holds them in a secret chamber until the time is right to find out if his supernatural split personality can rise to devour them.The women are led by a brave heroine who has her own past that is shrouded in sorrow. For when she was a child her beloved father was killed and she was left alone with her uncle - who abused her. She once tried to kill the uncle - but she failed - and perhaps she owes the devil its due.These two character's are bound for a showdown where they will battle one another and find find the answers that they seek to link them to their destiny in life - and what some may have felt was a let down I was highly moved and thought the performance of both lead actors was fantastic. As was the directing in the final moments. There is a super cool plot twist in the very end that blew me away - that the movie takes place in M Night's Unbreakable universe - which is an old M Night movie about a man who discovers he is a real life superhero and the world is full of wicked villains he is destined to combat.Split is not a scary movie - and there are some really badly written scenes. Some of the exposition is textbook highly problematic - but the truth is that M Night can get away with some bad writing - because his name has proved to sell millions of dollars so I let him pass.","

"Split","PetarNeo","1 February 2017","Three girls are being kidnapped and held hostage in mysterious place which is held by Kevin, a man with dissociative identity disorder. It is one creepy, terrific, disturbing and dark ride from the beginning to the end of the movie. As we learn more and more about Kevin and some of his personalities it gets more and more complicated and it starts to get really dark. With constant mention of the Beast and some doubts about it which are beautifully given us by Kevin's psychiatrist Fletcher. Only Casey from those three girls has a real values to story and with flashbacks that were from beginning weird and seemed like something was off they towards end filled magnificently and gave a real power to story. From early age and abuse that Kevin experienced now he developed mechanisms to keep him from harm and some so evil and powerful that will blow our minds. Tension kept building up really fast and time has come to final act of the movie. It was insane how vision of Shyamalan went to screen. It was bloody, dark, terrific, horrible and very disturbing. All praise to James McAvoy for playing 9 characters out of 23 (24) and his brilliant performance as well as characters shifting scene which was mind blowing. Shyamalan creation has returned more powerful than ever and there is much to say to his creation of this beautiful story. 4/4SPOILER ALERT! Considering flashbacks it was quite fitting to have them in way that Night put them so he could not give us too many information but kept us wondering and trying to figure things out. Showing the Beast and it's power is pretty intense with some great capabilities for further development. As some other characters in Unbreakable universe this one feels really superior and dark. Cafe scene was such a great ending for the movie and it finally gave this movie a genre, place and power that it deserved.","

The storyline was well-written and well-explained, even though it wasn't really simple. The characters were very interesting and so well-developed. The filming location of the movie was mainly, Inside Kevin's «cage». The casting was nice and their acting was perfect. It wasn't a very scary movie, however there were too many creepy and upsetting scenes. Also, the killcount wasn't really bloody and most kills were done off-screen. The opening scene was definitely unpredictable, really shocking and very promising. The ending scene was kinda unexpected and really intense. Overall, it was just a nice psychological/thriller movie, emotionally intense and I would probably recommend it to my friends.","

"Split","PStyles","20 February 2018","Overall I enjoyed this film, despite it's flaws. The concept is very intriguing in my opinion and has a lot to offer from a story telling perspective. For the majority of the film I was captivated and invested in the character's wellbeing...until the end. This movie is a shining example of how an ending can diminish what was an otherwise enjoyable experience. I will start by saying that James McAvoy was brilliant in ""Split"". He has, over the years, proven his worth and this film is yet another notch in his belt. While the script is inconsistent at times, McAvoy carries the load with his protrayal of a young man suffering from split personality disorder (23 to be exact, and thus we are given the title ""Split""). The acting is definitely one of the bright spots of this film, and McAvoy does not disappoint; he delivers a truly memorable experience from start to finish. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well; I was especially impressed by the performance of Betty Buckley who plays the therapist of Mcavoy's character Kevin. With an interesting premise and good-to-great acting, what could have possibly went wrong? Well, M. Knight Shyamalan is what went wrong. While i'll give him credit for rising above his recent disasters (and lets be honest, he hasn't made a halfway decent film since ""The Village""), he again attempts to be a bit too clever with this one. The ""twist"", as it's become known as in his works, is downright terrible and threatens to derail the entire movie. In fact, the first time I watched this I did not like it because of this ""twist"". It wasn't until my second viewing that I was able to appreciate this movie for what it does well. While the climax of this film is pretty disappointing, the actual conclusion is somewhat interesting. For those who have seen Shyamalan's (good) films, you will know what I speak of when you reach the end. Many did not like this, but I found it to be a pretty cool conclusion. Watch for yourself to see what I mean.I originally rated this film a 5 simply for the disappointing aformentioned climax, but after a second viewing I have decided that it deserves a better score than just ""average"". You must suspend disbelief if you wish to truly enjoy this film, but that isn't uncommon in the movie world. While the climax of the film leaves much to be desired (as well as some of the over-arching plot), overall this is a solid thriller worth watching in my opinion. Kudos to M. Knight for making another film actually worth watching (and one that doesn't make the list for potential worst movies ever).","

But, this one wasn't it.To illustrate the point, I look back over some of the roles that J Mc has had in fairly recent times - ""The Disappearance Of Eleanor Rigby"" (he was terrible and the movie was crap), ""Filth"" (he was awful and the movie was even worse), ""Welcome To The Punch"" (he was woefully bad and the movie was worse still) and then this lot of crap, ""Split"". A schizophrenic with 23 different and distinct persona? I'm no Psychiatrist but really, give us a break!! And then we're supposed to believe that a being of flesh and blood with 23 persona can develop a 24th and then be not only super-humanly strong but also resistant to shotgun fire at point blank range. Seriously, where do they get these dumb-arse ideas from?2016 produced some wonderfully good movies but this was not one of them. It was dreadful and probably worse is the prospect of a sequel which was set up at the end of this lot of rubbish.Is it the situation that J Mc just hasn't yet had enough good performances to attract decent scripts? I think that might be the case.I'll just say for now, you could probably safely stay away from anything that he's in and be none the worse off. Or, to put it another way, stay away from any movie that J Mc is in and you won't miss a thing.JMV","

"Split","cliew5473-107-917925","8 February 2024","The one thing that stands out for me, above all else, in this film is James McAvoy's superb acting. I don't know when the last time is (if ever) that I felt so incredibly impressed by someone's acting while watching a film. If McAvoy has not won any awards for his role in this film, that would be a tragedy. As for the film itself, it's a breath of fresh air in the horror genre in that it's not quite your yawn-inducing, typical horror film. It is clever and original and entertaining. Anya Taylor-Joy's acting in this film is also outstanding. Her expressions, everything. There was just something very believable about her to such an extent that it generated my empathy for her and the bizarre situation she found herself in. Indeed, she is not just a pretty face. She is also an amazing actor and one that is very believable and convincing. I would love to see McAvoy in more dynamic roles such as this one, as it's quite clear that he is an incredibly talented actor (and I feel like the word ""incredible"" is an understatement here). We have yet to watch the follow-up (?) film, ""Glass,"" but perhaps we will watch it tomorrow. I definitely look forward to seeing him play more of this same character. :)","

"Split","dbryn","29 January 2017","I think the movie started out great. I was captivated, intrigued, and was curious when the so called 'twist' was going to happen. The problem I have with this movie started in about the final 30minutes. SPOILER ALERT - The stage has been set, we're in a 'real world' with 'rules'. From out of nowhere, we have an insane person transforming and climbing on walls, bending bars, and brushing off two shots from a shotgun. For me, interest just went out the window. I was intrigued that this could happen to anyone, but a choice was made to bring in the supernatural. OK, fine... I figured this was all some artsy metaphors and perhaps all of the multiple personalities belonged to the girl which was intriguing. In the final moments it is revealed this is not the case at all, and we're in fact in the same movie world as ""Unbreakable"" from 17 years ago. Really? That was the big clever twist? Tying a movie with so much potential to a 17yr old film that no one really cared about to begin with? Confusing the hell out of likely 70% of the audience with this seemingly random tie-in? I think Shyamalan failed here miserably. Why would you put in the effort to bring this together with another 'average at best' movie from so long ago? Hugely disappointed. This was not even remotely close to his best work.","

Can they escape, or enlist the help of one or more of McAvoy's personalities, before The Beast arrives. Does The Beast even exist?This claustrophobic suspense thriller clatters along very satisfactorily in its own right - the girls, held prisoner by someone who is clearly very wrong in the head, have to overcome tearful hysteria and try to find a way out of their predicament before the much-heralded Beast arrives, a story which has its own self-contained clock ticking away. The girls are pleasingly hysterical - Claire, who has her own secrets, less so - but turn their attentions to problem-solving, and you root for them to find a way out of the trap they are in. Shyamalan's writing here works well after a number of clunkers.Then we have to factor in James McAvoy's performance/s as 8 or so of the two dozen multiple personalities. If I am ruthlessly critical, a couple of those are a bit on the obvious side. However, given that these are by far the most entertaining personalities - the audience was laughing out loud at Hedwig's dancing - and that they contrast so well with their far more sinister confederates, I think this can be forgiven.This is McAvoy's film. He holds the screen effortlessly whenever he is in front of the camera, and much of the film's effectiveness comes from not knowing who he is going to be next.Which is not to dismiss the girls. All are excellent, but I continue to be excited by Anya Taylor-Joy: after The Witch and Morgan, this role is a departure which, again, suits the off-kilter intensity she projects so well.And the final throwaway scene was an utter delight.","

"Split","gbill-74877","9 February 2018","James McAvoy turns in a strong performance here, adding some nice touches to the various personalities of his character(s), and is probably the best thing this film has going for it. Anya Taylor-Joy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Jessica Sula, the three teenage girls he abducts at the beginning of the film, are all reasonably good as well, and pretty besides. Maybe too pretty, as their casting and the plot feel a bit packaged. I liked the back-story of abuse and implication of going from one beast to another, and the line ""the broken are the more evolved"", which will resonate with anyone who has suffered while growing up. M. Night Shyamalan is at least coherent in this movie, but in the end, he doesn't really add all that much to the genre. It all seems done before, and the one 'new' element, the 24th personality, wasn't all that interesting. I wasn't too jazzed about the concept of setting up the next film either.

"Split","Pjtaylor-96-138044","21 February 2018","With perhaps the most meta twist-ending of all time, this psychological thriller represents somewhat of a return to form for Shyamalan - a writer/director who's career declined so heavily that he managed to not only make two of the best films of all time but also two of the worst - and a platform for McAvoy to really stretch his acting chops with a fantastic performance that perforates the piece. 'Split (2017)' is a bit silly regardless of its retroactive narrative justifications and lacks confidence in a number of key places, leading to a few on-the-nose expository dumps and jarringly unnecessary flashbacks. Despite some downright dodgy dialogue, it still manages to be both entertaining and interesting throughout, even if it's final act is incredibly rushed and wraps itself up in a neat yet unsatisfying way that only serves to bait a sequel that, with Shyamalan not quite back to what he once was, will surely disappoint. 7/10","

"Split","rgkarim","19 January 2017","No please not that, anything but that! This might be the screams you hear when another M. Night Shyamalan film rolls into theaters. The man who started out so strong, only to fall so far has tried his luck at horror once more in the featured film Split starring James McAvoy. Will a movie about split personalities kidnapping girls be the step he needs to climb back to top notch director, or will his movie be laughable at best? Robbie K here with yet another review, and as always I appreciate your reads. Let's get started!LIKE:  Creepy kind of horror  Decent plot to keep it interesting  Complex morals  James McAvoySummary: Fans of my reviews know creepy horror is better for me than jump scares, and Split is a prime example of spine-tingling chills. Shyamalan and his crew get incredible effects from such simple tactics, using isolation, subtle piano background music, and gradual information revelation to keep you in suspense. By using a believable human as the monster instead of some cheesy creature, the creeps are only further amplified by how horrible such a thing can be. But scares alone don't make a movie and Split does a decent job of crafting a tale to keep you hooked into the movie. While certainly not original, Split's plot is a culmination of smaller stories that detail the background info of a majority of our characters, helping to develop them in the short run time. All of these tales have a moral twist to it, but one story in particular raises an intriguing concept that may provide some food for thought, or at least an ethical dilemma for future talks. However, the piece de resistance is the leading actor James McAvoy who carries much of the movie. The man can play multiple personalities well, tweaking his mannerisms and dialogues in subtle ways to craft an entirely different identity. His talents, as well as the direction, kept all his characters in the realistic zone, which while creepy, also made engaging characters to grab on to. There are few actors to which I could see doing the spectacular job he did.DISLIKE:  Predictable Story  Trailer has shown much  Don't see all the personalities  Mixed on the endingSummary: Despite the story being very well-developed for a horror story, it also isn't the most unique either. Outside of the twenty-three-personality quirk, you can guess much of the backstory of each character and where the film is going by about the 30-minute mark. Part of the predictability can be attributed to the trailer revealing a lot of key details in the short collection of scenes, including the big revelation at the end. The trailer also harbors on the twenty-three personalities, but in reality, it's more like four with a few cameos from the others. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing (as too many personalities could be very sloppily done), it also was a wasted gimmick. What do I mean by this confusing statement? I mean, why make twenty-three, instead of say ten, or even five? What was the significance of twenty-three outside of a nickname if you weren't going to integrate all of them? This dislike comes from the trailer's focus on high number only to once again let it fizzle out. And as for the ending, it's a very open-ended finale that leaves a lot of questions up in the air. Perhaps the potential sequel will answer these components, but only time will tell. The VERDICT:Split, to my surprise, was much better than I thought and was a horror movie worthy of the franchise. If you are looking for realistic chills, a satisfying plot, and fantastic acting of someone with a mental health disorder then certainly check this movie out. In fact, in regards to the horror genre I would warrant this movie earns a trip to the theater. However, as a movie overall, it still has its shortcomings, especially in regards to the twenty-three-personality gimmick. Yet one thing is for certain, if Shyamalan can continue this trend he may fall back into the favorable director field once more. My scores are:Horror/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0","

"Split","TaylorYee94","27 April 2022","First half is awesome, so convincing and psychologically intriguing. Suspense is there with the support of appropriate use of sound. Thumping sound is hidden in the score, making heart beat faster, and when Claire is trapped in the cabinet with resonating sound of her breathing and panting, audience feels trapped as well. McAvoy's performance of Dissociative Identity Disorder patient is skillful and powerful. However, what happened to the last half? Shyamalan throws away half of the work built for an hour and transforms genre from thriller & crime to sci-fi out of nowhere. ""The Beats"" went too far, and he is so human, talking too eloquently, intelligently, and philosophically. According to all the basis explained by Dr. Fletcher and described in the movie, it's understandable that he has superhuman strength and beats-like agility but changing body forms and surviving after two shots contradict the first half of what the director has been saying.* Split not only portrays Kevin's state of mind but also defines the style of this film. The main setting, Kevin's basement is split into respective rooms of different identities. When girls first wake up from unconsciousness, Casey is separated from other two, audience seeing symmetrical contrast. Bars are shown many times dividing rather whole one image such as the gate of hideout and the last confrontation between Kevin and Casey.","

It's 110 minutes and yet it feels even longer than that. It's also simply not as ""fun"" as I wanted it to be. Instead of not taking it self seriously at all, the film is way too solemn and serious for its own good. At the same time, however, I admire its willingness to be something more than a cheesy horror/thriller, as it is also highlighting the types of mental processes that can occur with this type of medical condition. It's also very well shot, with some nice, fluid camera-work. The acting is also solid, but it's James McAvoy who impresses the most. He is easily the biggest reason to see this. He gives it his all.","

And that does mean something!Unfortunately he hasn't really followed up with creating another great film, but his previous two have been much better than say Airbender or The Happening.Of course the story was interesting and compelling. There was little doubt that Shyamalan would ever fail in that aspect. The editing and cinematography were pretty great.

Really, this dopey would-be psychological thriller lacks credibility from start to can't-come-soon-enough finish.

"Split","stonedraim","3 June 2017","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Right into it; The way M. Night Shyamalan in a very clear way makes his way through the 23 different personalities into the showcase of the movie is more than great. All viewers should have a fair chance to take onto the contemplation of the ""different splits"". On his edge, Mr. Shyamalan is here. Enjoy!It seems as Mr. Shyamalan has taken several movies and stories as inspiration and made this his own. I find traces of ""Room"" and ""Cloverfield Lane 10"" On top of this, the hide and seek motion and emotion from different horror games grasps hold of the screen as the audience just can follow through the games of the 23 patients. Watch the game ""Alien Isolation"", ""Dead Space"" and ""Outlast""...As usual (speaking of let us say Signs, Unbreakable and The Village) the blend of a social oriented day to day basis along with a creeping disliking horror comes to surface as the time passes by within ""Split"". If you like a some what original movie with a tight script and story, then ""Split"" should be taken care of by you. Some of you will crumble into psychological elements now and then, just to be aware of yourself jumping high and.... scream?!One of biggest fear of modern society may be the new and yet to explore sides and spaces of the human mind. All the psychological aspects, all the dysfunctional aspects, all the borderline discussions and the realism of philosophy; ""Split"" combines that with fear and throws a vast heap of question marks along the entertainment to both comply and investigate. I am very impressed how this is handled. Look about 35 minutes into the movie.----- 41:30...hey.....it is M. Night Shyamalan himself behind the computer! ""I've got red socks... I've got blue socks too... etcetera..."" Is this review a little different and goes here and there...? Yes, it is. Can there be a 25th........? ""We are what we believe we are."" -----This movie evolves around very interesting and deep matters. Can a human mind through extreme ""measures"" or ""pure power"" change a human being physically? Can it be that a human that has traumatic and tragic episodes processed have a more vast conscious and become/be more of an evolved person? Is schizophrenia a psycho-social matter, or is it in some way ""a true distorted view"" formed by the mind and brain, physically? What if adrenaline by the form of the story behind Bruce Banner becoming an extremely strong human being (The Hulk) combined with schizophrenia can create ""something""/someone abnormal, as the beast in here.....? Can a person develop strong skills and behaviours from animal and form itself from there on into something else...?M. Night Shyamalan himself were ""bad mouthed"" from fans and media about being a some what of schizophrenic.... and here he answers all that with a whole movie. (Clap clap!) The woman in the movie has been sexual abused. Can that be that she comprehend dominating males to be ""monsters""... is that her perspective? The viewer gets to know her more and more... and, at the end.... why is the steel bar of the cell all of a sudden straight again...? Is the perspective in her mind?In a time where the neuropsychiatric world is more and more explored and ""combinations"" such as ADHD, ADD and so on is under the microscope, ""Split"" takes that social debate and twists it. Well done! Are the society labeling too harsh and being judgemental...?The ending is one of the most intelligent I have seen in a long, long time. Made the rate jump up a bit, actually... over 8,0. It starts about 1 hour and 50 minutes into the movie. The music, the timing... M. Night Shyamalan... Sixth sense, Unbreakable... Bruce Willis.... Mr. Glass..... it all came down to this. I shouted right out and felt my hands applaud... What an ending!Over to the movie as a product: - The production : An simple and pure production. In its narrow path of production, the horror elements become grotesque. Mr. Shyamalans way of letting the truth and authentic story come forward is right in place in ""Split"". M. Night Shyamalan has almost perfected his own style. - The actors : James McAvoy nails the part. He delivers both pure evil, manipulation and grief of some kind. A textbook example of schizophrenia; see about 40 minutes into ""Split"". The whole session is finalized with depth of an competent actor surrounded with expertise of M. Night Shyamalan. - Entertainment : The motion picture takes you on a roller coaster. Up...down...here and there... and inside out, if you let it. - Age : 15, due to strong psychological aspects, violence and blood.8,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 9 Brilliant and admirable 8 Excellent movie and a solid production)","

While the girls are trying to find a way to escape the kidnapper is on the verge of releasing a 24th and even more dangerous personality. This is a movie that is just flat out tense and good. The movie isn't straight horror as much as psychological and disturbing. The movie itself is almost a must see, but the real reason to watch is for McAvoy's performance. It's one of the best ever put on film. Being a Shyamalan movie I was trying to predict the crazy twist ending that he is known for, and of all my guesses I wasn't even close. That is the sign of a good movie. Overall, easily Shyamalan's best movie since the Sixth Sense, and unlike that one, this is one you can watch more than once. I give this an A.","

"Split","skybrick736","4 June 2017","When it comes to Split, M. Night Shyamalan has put questions to rest if he can ever create a thriller with terrific built suspense or a thoughtfully written twist ending. The story really anchored the film, which relied on intricate dialogue, scene by scene and a limited cast to sell it. What's different about modern Shyamalan thrillers compared to his past ones is his comic relief that he's been able to successfully apply. The ensemble of personalities James McAvoy portrays was engaging, each well-crafted and had their own distinguished presence. Along with McAvoy's performances, Anya Taylor-Joy was also marvelous as the introverted lead female with complexities that were well built. Split establishes an anxiety-filled atmosphere, fluid build up to the end, with little mercy shown to characters and viewers. Split is well worth the watch, and without spoiler, its recommended to watch Shyamalan's early thrillers beforehand.","

"Split","barbagvido","20 April 2017","Split is a film directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars James McAvoy as this man with 23 personalities who kidnaps these young girls and they try to escape. Shyamalan's career is quite a story. With his first few movies (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable""...), he was hailed as the new Spielberg and had a bright future. Then, all of the sudden, he starts releasing some bad, bad movies (""The Happening"", ""The Last Airbender""...). Then he redeemed himself with 2015's The Visit which was quite a refreshing thing for the found footage genre and it took everyone by surprise. That gave a bit more hope for this one when it was getting released. And now we can finally safely say that Shyamalan is back on track!I've always liked Shyamalan as a director. He had some horrible movies, but still, he was one of the only ones who mostly had original stories and ideas with movies and that alone makes me respect him. I expected this to be good, but it took me off guards. It's his best since ""The Sixth Sense"" and I'd even go as far to say that it's even better. It has a small opening scene and then it throws you straight into action to assure that you're following. Then, after that, you get to know the backstories and characters little by little. And each new reveal, pumps up the anxiety of this film. From the first few minutes, Shyamalan assures that he has our attention and the feeling of uneasiness grows throughout the movie. Visually, the film looks beautiful and cinematography is fantastic. But even though everything impressed me about this film, there's one more particular thing that blew me away and that's James McAvoy. He has to get recognition on the next awards season. It would be a crime if he got snubbed. Let's just hope he doesn't get overshadowed by someone who got a certain accent right or who perfectly portrayed a mental breakdown in one scene because McAvoy does it all here. He was incredible and boosted up the creepiness in some scenes. The rest of the cast is pretty good too, but all of them are overshadowed by McAvoy. And also, you might know Shyamalan is known for twist endings. Trust me, you WON'T see this one coming.I have no flaws with this film. I loved absolutely everything about it. It's for now my favorite movie of 2017 and it's likely to stay that way. But, you never know.","

"Split","spaceashwin","10 October 2017","I think Split is one of the best Psychological thriller movies in the past few years. I'm not sure if it has comparisons with other thrillers but would rather say that the idea is indeed very interesting. Look at Mrs. Fletcher who tries to convince the audience at the conference that the human mind has evolved to a different stage. Shyamalan pushes this concept even further saying that if there are a set of personalities to explore then the final outcome reachable would be something supernatural which in this case is the Beast. The creation of the personalities, if is a result of the childhood trauma then the idea of a super powered being is something which contradicts the concept of the capability of the human mind. Since the devil lives on after being hit by two bullets( and in this case Shyamalan is not trying to show that there are only two bullets for Casey but the magnitude of destruction that can be caused by the bullets) there is direct reference to something beyond being human. Even if this is one of the finest interpretations out there for Splitm the Director fails to explain indirectly why there is a difference in approach the 23 personalities have towards humans and the approach of the Beast.Are the personalities functionalities for the beast? The use of the spray versus the kill?. Why does the devil need Humans? Is it some kind of vengeance that would actually improve lives of people like Kevin or the beast? I say this because Dennis and Patricia are trying to protect Kevin. Kevin seems to have gone through a childhood trauma so whatever is trying to protect him is not doing so against the devil. All this holds true if the 23 personalities manifest to the beast or like how I said reaches out and becomes the beast. What is the beast trying to accomplish? Will the next sequel 'the Glass' have answers to this? If it had to leave out people like Casey who had been tortured at a young age there is definitely something the beast is trying to prove by killing the impure. Why does it kill Mrs. Fletcher? Is the devil a manifestation of only that kind of emotion related to child abuse? Is that some kind of ideal the beast is trying to put forth? If Barry, Dennis and the others are the outcome of the child abuse and the beast is its final form ,is killing a cure to the angst and anger within Kevin? These are questions that need to be explained! One thing is sure that not all the personalities are aware of the beast. Do the killings by the beast and the protection of Kevin have any kind of relation? In the end I feel the beast lives on the mind of people like Kevin (not all the personalities ) who strangely/accidentally accept the devil with a different set of ideas(Dennis and Patricia take control of Kevin's life-""we are in control"") which in turn helps the beast to live and spread itself farther.

"Split","view_and_review","4 November 2017","I had written off M. Night Shayamalan. He had a string of bad movies and it seemed that was the new norm for him: The Happening, The Last Air Bender, Lady in the Water and perhaps there are others I'm forgetting. So, when Split was released and they said it was a Shayamalan production I thought: ""I'll pass.""Then I started hearing the rave reviews. I heard more than one which planted a small seed in my head like maybe I should watch this. So I did.Split wasn't as bad as the aforementioned movies but it wasn't all that great either. As the title indicates the movie is about an individual with dissociative identity disorder (i.e. multiple personalities). One (or maybe more) personality is responsible for kidnapping three teenage girls and it is unknown what his plans are for them. Because it is a Shayamalan movie your mind is trying to dream up all kinds of possibilities.The film moves somewhat slow as the plot is gradually unfolded. McAvoy is adequate as the main character although there was a lot to be desired from the rest. The movie is OK as it explores the mind, its fragility and its strength. It's not Shayamalan's best but it is far from his worst.","

"Split","najafisaghar","8 February 2017","What if at the end of the movie, when camera was closing in on Casey holding a gun in a cage, all torn out and looking horrified, we found out that the whole movie was nothing but a figment of her imagination, a trip to her psyche, to make for and come to terms with her childhood abuse? I was holding my breath and wishing for this ending, when I found out that the movie was actually for real. The loopholes in the plot and in theories of consciousness and identity startled me so much that I couldn't stop asking thinking Shyamalan, the director, did not ask for professional advice on such sensitive subjects. If the ending showed a twisted dark person as Casey was, then the movie could have been PERFECT, literally perfect. But it wasn't. it was an average movie trying to push its way to its desired ending through impossibilities and an imperfect logical reasoning. My question during the whole movie, was how such a plot could be based on ""what if there is something more to people with multi-dimensional personality that direct us to understanding what supernatural is"", what the psychologist, Ms. Dr. Fletcher told her colleague. Multi-dimensional personality is a possible psychological phenomenon but digesting the fact that 23 different people lived in one person, who was also conscious of this mental state which makes it more impossible to believe, was difficult personally. Another question was why did not the psychologist order the hospitalization of Kevin? Shouldn't such people be in mental hospitals taken care of? Other questions could be raised as to How could he live in a zoo without anyone noticing him commuting? Or Can a childhood issue, the one with Kevin and his mother, create such a 'beast'? or Can you be conscious of your multiple personality disorder and shift among characters once you decide? All these questions are left for the viewers to answer on their own. Instead, what Shyamalan could leave for the viewers to find out on the own could be a subtler, implied personality problems and mental fixations such as OCD; the latter one was so obvious in Kevin's behavior that the color yellow and his fixation on cleaning lost its sense. Another disappointing point was the director's desperate act for increasing the movie box office by showing ""unessential"" nudity and ""unjustified"" violence. On the contrary, James McAvoy, Kevin among 22 other names, performed greatly which causes you not to leave the movie hall in the middle of the movie. The supernatural aspect of movie can be interpreted as Freudian. McAvoy, I believe, has gone through three important Freudian phases; the supernatural part, as he turned into a beast was the 'id' part which I believed he has always been trying to go back to; his superego part was present in his meetings with Dr. Fletcher and due to his incompetency to keep with reality, his ego was represented into 23 different characters. This aspect can be further investigated by those interested in Freudian psychology; yet, I still hope that the beast at the end of the movie had been metaphorical.","

"Split","jboothmillard","5 February 2017","Director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs) has had a string of failures, including The Village, The Happening and The Last Airbender, I heard the reviews and saw the clips for this new film, it seemed worth a go. Basically, three teenagers, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and outsider Casey (Atlantis's Anya Taylor-Joy) are kidnapped by a man, who they later realise has more than one personality, in fact he inhabits twenty-three. The kidnapper, Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) was a victim of abuse during childhood, he has severe dissociative identity disorder. Kevin's personalities include ""Dennis"" who is a control freak and has obsessive-compulsive disorder, ""Barry"" who is an artistic fashion designer and the dominant personality, ""Patricia"" who is an assuring prissy woman, and ""Hedwig"" who is a vulnerable nine-year- old boy. While the kidnapped girls try to find a way out, including manipulating the various personalities to escape, Kevin in his other guises often visits his psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), who believes some of his personalities can manifest unique physical attributes for each personality. As ""Dennis"" and ""Patricia"", Kevin warns the girls that they will sacrificed to ""The Beast"", the twenty-fourth personality waiting to be unleashed, he also talks about the possibility of this ""real"" personality emerging with Dr. Fletcher, who is trying to understand the reason for his disorder. While this is all going, the film goes into flashback to see five-year-old Casey (Izzie Leigh Coffey) and her own traumatic childhood, who suffered the death of her father (Sebastian Arcelus), and was molested by her uncle John (Brad William Henke), who became her legal guardian, she completed shooting him with a rifle, but hesitated. Eventually Dr. Fletcher slowly realises something is wrong and that Kevin is hiding something, and Kevin meanwhile does bring out the feared personality ""The Beast"", capable of superhuman levels of strength, speed, mobility and the hunger for human flesh. Marcia and Claire are killed by ""The Beast"", but Casey manages to escape, it turns out they were trapped underneath Philadelphia Zoo, where Kevin lives and works, ""Dennis"", ""Patricia"" and ""Hedwig"" exert permanent control of Kevin's body. In the end, the news of Kevin's crimes is reported on the news, he is nicknamed ""The Horde"", someone in a diner watching remarks that it reminds them of a wheelchair-bound terrorist from 15 years ago, an older David Dunn (Bruce Willis) tells them it was ""Mr. Glass"", this is a twist ending revealing it is a sequel to Unbreakable, ""The Horde"" is supposed to be another villain of Dunn's story. Also starring James McAvoy ""Barry"" / ""Orwell"" / ""Jade"", Neal Huff as Mr. Benoit and M. Night Shyamalan as Jai, Hooters Lover. McAvoy demonstrates his splendid acting ability as the lunatic kidnapper with the severe personality disorder, he is both chilling and at times amusing, the supporting characters never know which personality they are dealing with, it is creepy almost all the way through, and it is a good twist to the kidnap scenario movie, but the flashbacks are pointless, and the ""twist"" ending is nothing that memorable, the film as a whole is so-so, an average psychological horror-like thriller. Worth watching!","

"Split","CinemaClown","7 April 2017","From the writer-director of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable & The Visit, Split is a small-scale psychological horror that marks another right step in M. Night Shyamalan's road to recovery and finds him making skillful use of his rediscovered creativity & passion to put up a simple structured, competently crafted & morbidly humoured chiller that's dark, mysterious & wickedly amusing.The story of Split follows a trio of teenage girls who are abducted by a man diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and who has manifested a total of 23 different personalities so far. With no one to rely on but each other, the girls try to compel one of his identities to help them escape and must do so before the emergence of a far sinister & frightful 24th persona.Written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan whose filmmaking career has seen both soaring highs & crushing lows, Split is a more confidently executed feature from him that makes efficient use of all his trademarks, and keeps its tense vibe alive from beginning to end. The characters do lack flesh on their arcs and are thinly sketched but their predicament is still relatable to an extent.Shot majorly in a single location, the isolated setting do bring a sense of unease into the story and it is further enhanced by its smooth handling, sharp focus & controlled movements of the camera. Editing briskly paces its 117 minutes narrative, few scenes are drawn out longer than expected and its eerie tone rarely goes away. The film keeps throwing surprises throughout its runtime and few of them manage to stick.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, Betty Buckley & Haley Lu Richardson, with McAvoy & Taylor-Joy chipping in with commendable work. Not all the 23 identities appear but McAvoy does well with whichever ones make it to the final print. Taylor-Joy is just as good if not more and the moments between the two make up for the film's best segments, plus it only gets better as plot progresses.On an overall scale, Split is a well-directed, well-scripted & well-performed horror that may not be as memorable as the finest examples of its genre or even Shyamalan's best works but it definitely ranks as one of his better directional efforts. Enjoyable, entertaining & quite satisfying, Split is a thrilling ride that keeps the viewers engaged in its premise from start to finish and wraps itself up with a game-changing final twist that no one saw coming. And for that alone, it's worth a watch.","

"Split","GrahamCrawford2005","24 January 2017","There seems to be an emerging narrative that he's back. Maybe because the budgets are smaller people now see M Night Shyamalan as some kind of underdog that we should be rooting for. And I do root for him because I think The Sixth Sense is a classic and Unbreakable, Signs and The Village had their moments. But a string of jaw-droppingly awful films - Lady in the Water, The Happening, The Last Airbender and After Earth – obliterated my confidence in him. Some reviewers hailed The Visit as a return to form, but despite a promising concept the idiotically implausible characterization of the boy, who literally can't move when he's afraid, killed it for me.But that's Night. In nearly everything he does there is a critical plot point that is so contrived and ridiculous it takes me right out of the film and I can never get back in. It wouldn't be so bad if his tongue was in cheek and he had some fun with it. But it's always something banal presented in a profound, meaningful way as if it's some earth-shattering artistic insight. Add Split to the list.The three central performances are strong. James McAvoy is wickedly convincing as the split-personality psychopath. Betty Buckley has quiet strength, dignity and great intelligence and compassion as his psychiatrist. Anya Taylor-Joy, so powerful in The Witch, pulls you in with her big soulful eyes and makes it impossible not to root for her. But I would argue that the only reason her two friends are taken hostage with her is as a pretext to film pretty girls in their underwear. They are completely superfluous, unless one buys the story's malarkey that the Beast personality needs to eat them to gain strength. (I didn't) Walling the girls off from each other early in the film is a waste. I was much more interested in how they might work together to outsmart their captor and escape.Casey's (Taylor-Joy's) backstory told in flashbacks undercuts the suspense of the present-day storyline. (It's Night's overworked theme of everything, no matter how seemingly remote, eventually tying together.) It would have been far more interesting, and McAvoy's character much more sympathetic, if Casey had stumbled across him doing something incriminating and he had reluctantly taken her hostage and now doesn't know what to do. But of course that would have been a less sensational approach with less box office potential.There are nods to The Village (sort of) and Unbreakable (big-time) at the end that are fun, but in the case of Unbreakable, make little sense when you think about it. Night longs for a fusion between the real, humdrum world and the supernatural that, while terrifying, forces us to confront our demons and gives life meaning and purpose. I'm down with that, but he pursues this artistic objective in such a repetitive, immature way it bores. He knows film school tricks and how to manipulate a camera (and sometimes an audience) but I'm always aware I'm watching a movie, I don't get lost in them. He tries too hard to impress and in so doing ties himself in narrative knots that he can only escape through clumsy magic-for-beginner tricks.Split opened well at the box office on the strength of McAvoy's showy, ""Next Hannibal Lecter"" performance. And pretty girls in their underwear. But I would be willing to bet the next time Night is given a big budget he'll blow it. Because unlike truly great filmmakers, he just can't seem to think of anything original to say. But man, he keeps trying.","

They found a glimpse of light in ""The Visit"", which indeed was a big step up compared to his recent movies, but it was still a mediocre and not very memorable thriller comedy. The reviews, however, often made it sound like a minor masterpiece.This movie is also a step up, but not at all the fantastic comeback everybody hail it to be. ""Split"" would fare better without the twist, which appeal to fans of one of his first movies, but really is awkwardly inserted. Or, it would fare much better if the twist WAS inserted in a skilled and seamless way. Now it is a surprising bullshit ending -- everything leading up to it is muddled, too convoluted and hidden among details which have nothing to do with the twist. The plot you get in this movie is far away from the clear and distinct structure and storytelling in Shyamalan's first movies like ""Seventh Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". You could see these movies a second time and be amazed by how every small detail fitted in the machinery which revealed itself in the end.Not here.","

The main concept of this movie is a really good idea, but how they did it, is absolutely bad. I am very sorry, that this movie did not meet my expectations. I gave four stars, because I saw something from M.N.S. vision in this movie, but this was far behind the previous movies of him. I recommend to see Identity or Primal Fear. Both movies are far better ones, than this one with multiple personalities.","

"Split","sugarbearis","28 January 2017","Not scary or suspenseful at all. McAvoy's character was ridiculous and not the least bit frightening. In fact, I laughed through most of his performance. I almost walked out halfway through, but i wanted to give the movie a chance to get better- it didn't; in fact, it went further downhill. To call this movie horror or smart or clever, even in the slightest, is a flat-out insult to the viewer. This movie sucks- waste of time and money. The critic's seem to have viewed a completely different version and praise this movie up and down. Not only not scary, but just not a very we written and developed story line. So much potential was lost here. I'm baffled by the rave reviews of the critics, are they smoking something that might have made this an entirely different movie?","

But they all have enough to make them enjoyable, for me anyways (except for 6th sense).Here the story is good, imagine 10 clover field lane it the kidnapper had different personalities, McAvoy is really good, I don't normally care that much, i mean acting should always be good.. it's their job, but you can tell when he switches between one personality and another and he plays them well and adds to the movie. annoyingly, the rest of the cast are awful, script wise. Even when the kidnapper is being an 8 year old child sitting in a corner they still don't attempt to escape, when one of them suggests maybe they should all attack him, being 3 of them, with countless objects in the room to use as weapons, the main girl says no, in an attempt for her to be the reasonable an clever one... OK so you'll be expecting a twist, it's a bit different here, and I'm not sure about it, but the fact is i've been thinking about it quite a bit and so i guess it must be good! although i hated it at the time.. and still do...","

"Split","baileycrawly","15 March 2020","Every now and then, a Hollywood actor comes out and does the seemingly impossible.
In Split, James McAvoy brilliantly portrays a man with multiple personalities, providing a distinct portrayal for each and every character. They truly are their own entities existing within his body, and it's fantastic.
The premise of this movie is simple. A troubled man with multiple personalities kidnaps three young women and holds them hostage as they try to escape, warming up to the character's friendlier personalities and trying to trick the less cooperative.
It was fun and creepy without heavy reliance on jump scares, which is refreshing for the horror genre. There are also a few moments that are genuinely quite humorous.
M. Night Shyamalan was always a hit-or-miss director for me, but this was an amazing movie.","

"Split","jaysanchu07","11 September 2022","M Night Shyamalan strikes back! Split is one hell of a psychological thriller that captivates. It has an intriguing premise, a ""horde"" of amusing characters and one for the books storyline that delivers engrossing horror, deserving of a second & third watch.Split is ultimately carried by the dynamic performance of James McAvoy, who evidently gives his 100% to the role. He plays each personality distinctly, whether through voice or expression, paving the way for riveting scenes where McAvoy slips from one persona to another. Through his discomforting yet fascinating brilliance, his character(s) is then able to convey all the essentials of a horror film villain. He is cold and calculated in one scene, violent and menacing in the next, leaving audiences nerve wrecked, on what could happen next. All of these executed, without the need for special effects. Fine work!As for the genius behind the curtains, Split is as well a reminder, of how great a filmmaker M Night can be. His use of dark and claustrophobic visuals, elevates the film's appeal & horror. His writing delivers brooding tension, whether from the captives' struggle to escape, or the masterful depiction of the bizarre elements of McAvoy's DID. His use of therapy sessions for expositions and back stories for perspective, flawlessly enrich the narrative & ensures audience appreciation of his characters. The film's final acts was as well jaw dropping and rewarding, rivaling Sixth Sense as having the best closure for M Night films.Overall, Split delivers quite an impactful watch. The riveting narrative, messages on exploitation & brand of horror are well received through remarkable acting & fine screenplay . It is then a film that cements McAvoy as a worthy actor & M Night's resounding return to form.","

"Split","eddie_baggins","2 February 2017","Until last year's mini-comeback The Visit hit our cinema screens, it seemed like the ""it"" thing to do was talk down the undeniable talents of M. Night Shyamalan as a filmmaker.A writer/director of unique vision that gave birth to one of the greatest debuts of all time with The Sixth Sense and followed it up with the memorable Unbreakable and Signs and the underrated The Village, only to be found wanting with misguided films Lady in the Water and (cold shudder alert) The Last Airbender and The Happening, the young director seemed to have lost his way and everyone was having a great time reminding each other about it, but showing once and for all that you can't keep a talent down forever, the commercially successful and critically liked Split see's Shyamalan back doing what he does best, delivering audience appeasing thrillers with fresh unpredictable twists.While not reaching the grand heights of his early products, Split which ends up going to some fairly dark and twisted places as it deals with a group of abducted teenage girls led by The Witch's Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey and their increasingly demented encounters with their adductor Kevin, who just so happens to have a further 22 personalities with an added addition on its way, is a constantly engaging and often unpredictable beast that is anchored by a powerful display of acting turns from James McAvoy.Whether playing the OCD Dennis, the child like Hedwig, the fashion introvert Barry or an array of other identities including a late starter to the horde in the films final stages, McAvoy dominates the film and elevates it to grander heights than it's somewhat slight narrative aims go for and while Split is unlikely to be a film awards season cares to recognise come the end of 2017, there's little denying that we've already seen one of the year's most standout acting displays and arguably the turn of McAvoy's still developing career.The other highlight of Split is seeing Shyamalan back on impressive directing and writing duties with the film featuring a number of tension riddled examples of direction (and a standout dance scene) and a number of brave writing choices, some of which will shock the audiences in the later stages, and in particular give greater meaning to Casey's plight.It's great to have the Shyamalan of old back, not to the level we know his capable of, but Split is a thriller with a difference, filled with an odd yet evident heart and James McAvoy having the time of his life running wild with one of modern cinemas most spine-tingling villains. With the added addition of an end coda likely to please Shyamalan fans of old, Split is well worth your time.3 ½ cd players out of 5","

"Split","AnishMisra","8 April 2017","Plot: 3 Girls are kidnapped and kept in a place by a man who suffers from multiple personality disorder. He has 23 identities of himself and warns the girls of a 24th one who is about to come.Review: This review of mine will be containing some Spoilers, so please if you haven't watched the film please don't read the review.So Split is a film directed by M. Night Shyamalan who is mostly known for the films which have some sense of super-naturalism in it. I saw this film with huge expectations and man the expectations (if not all) were met. The film is 117 minutes long and I was invested in it for most of the time.Talking about the plot of the film. The plot started out as a somewhat normal Kidnapping type of film. But then as the story progresses, we see that the kidnapping goes way deeper than what is was meant for. For me, the pace of the film started after 30-35 minutes or so. I guess that is when Kevin's personalities come to light. At first many people would think how the hell is Shyamalan going to manage the space for 24 personalities. But yes he does. Hats off for that. I also for some time wondered what the hell does Casey's backstory have to do with this. But you see that the backstory is an integral part of Casey. Also we do have a Dr. Karen who's character is fleshed out quite good who tries to help our protagonist (antagonist).Now about the performances. James McAvoy (who I better know as Professor Charles Xavier of X men) killed it. The personalities were portrayed by him were near perfect. I especially like the characters of Patricia and Hedwig. The 24th character (Beast) was not too convincing for me (Maybe I have a taste for violent films, so that is why I was expecting some gore in that part). Anna Taylor as Casey was also great. Actually if you see it is a film about the way how both Casey and Kevin deal with the abuse in their childhood in the present day. The film shows the contrast between these 2 behaviors in a very nice way. The role of Betty too as the caring doctor was great.My Favorite scene would be towards the climax where Casey tells Kevin's whole name. Kevin comes to his normal self and asks Casey to kill him. But then the other personalities of Kevin come and scare off Casey. As I said above, the Beast wasn't too convincing for me, but Casey's fear during the scene actually made up for the horror that was needed for the scene.Spoiler reveal: (which I had actually known for quite some time). We see Bruce Willis in the end as David Dunn sitting in a cafe watching a news about Kevin. Many Unbreakable fans (as myself) would be quite happy seeing that. Many people were waiting for a sequel to a Unbreakable. And I am happy we have got something close to that. Shyamalan too has said that his next film will be in this U/S U (My abbreviation for Unbreakable/Split Universe). So can't wait for David vs Kevin (if that would be the plot for the next film in this universe).Final word: Split is actually a great film. Do watch out for the great performance by James McAvoy. Although little loose during the start, but once it keeps the grip it never loosens it till the very last scene. The opening and closing credits are also done in a quite interesting way.So for me Split is an 8/10 film.","

He has a lot of personalities (16 personalities, correct me if I'm wrong). And each personality has a different memory and attitude.James Macavoy gave me creeps in portraying the unsettling villain. Anya Taylor-Joy also did a good job portraying the young woman with a troubled past. The story is creepy, and the reveal that the villain actually has superpowers didn't shock me (because of spoilers) but it was great.

The answer seems to be no.I thought this would be a psychological thriller, which it leads you to believe. But it ends up being a cheesy ""comic book"" style movie, with scantily-clad teenage girls being abused and a supernatural human monster. I thought at least there would be some big ""reveal"" near the end to make it satisfying, but there wasn't. Are we supposed to be impressed that it all took place in a zoo? (Notice that ""zoo"" starts with zzzzzzz...) Or that this film is apparently a sequel to ""Unbreakable,"" a forgettable movie I saw ages ago? There's also a subtext about child abuse which is disturbing. The psycho was abused as a child, and we learn that the survivor girl ALSO was abused...by a creepy uncle. She has marks on her body from cutting and from cigarettes, which we don't see until about 1:42:00 - self-inflicted, or done by uncle? And at the end we learn she is still in the custody of said uncle. This girl is supposed to be smart, yet she says nothing to anyone about the abuse?Now MNS reveals this is the ""middle film"" in a trilogy. And if you're familiar with other middle films of trilogies, you know that usually means an unsatisfactory ending and a plot that just treads water. That's what we have here, folks. Don't waste your time, despite good performances by McEvoy and Buckley.","

And while even a supernatural element at the end made it interesting it failed to produce that feeling of satisfaction I wanted, if not expected from M Knight. It may be worth watching again to detect any missed easter eggs or twists, but I can only give it slightly better than average and not up to Sixth Sense standards.","

"Split","stevenrotherforth","16 October 2018","SplitSplit is a return to form for writer/director M.Night Shyamalan and also offers a career best performance by James McAvoy.
Or should I say career best performances?
McAvoy plays Kevin a man diagnosed with twenty three distinct personalities. He is responsible for abducting three young women and holds them captive against their will.
What is most impressive about this tightly scripted thriller is McAvoy's ability to switch between the personalities so convincingly. Every little trait and mannerism is brilliantly performed as he changes his voice and body language to create the distinctive characters.
One moment McAvoy could be a nine year old boy and the next he's a creepy OCD ridden middle aged man.
He bounces from one character to another with seamless efficiency.The three kidnapped girls must find means of escape before a twenty-fourth personality surfaces.
One that is monsterous and all together evil.
Ana Taylor-Joy is the stand
out abductee as she plays Casey Cooke. A troubled girl with just enough survival instinct to challenge all of Kevin's personas.Split is carefully written and wonderfully shot. Reminiscent of Shyamalan's early work, such as Unbreakable and The Sixth sense.
There's a intriguing twist at the end that links this story to one of Shyamalan's earlier films too.
I'll not give the surprise away as it will set up a sequel to Split and another one of Shyamalan's movies.
Split could be considered to be a sequel in its own right.
Subtle nods may indicate to this but it is only truly revealed right before credits role.
This is a superbly acted, directed and written thriller that is well worth your time.
I'm now looking forward to seeing what will happen next.","

"Split","Cineanalyst","7 October 2019","Although some critics and fans--backed up by box-office receipts--claimed this as writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's comeback, ""Split"" is nevertheless an exploitative, derivative and incongruent horror movie. Like some of Shyamalan's other post-""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) debacles, one can see how it could've been a better picture had the project not been of such an errant mind--straying all over the place--and, ultimately, relying upon a series of clichés--most blatant of which is the filmmaker's trademark twist endings.There's a lot of trash here: it's yet another movie about a psycho abducting, holding captive and terrorizing people--usually young women or teenage girls. Dissociative identity disorder is exploited for the fear of people with mental illness (although, I suppose, it's good that filmmakers seem to have finally learned that schizophrenia has nothing to do with multiple personalities--good riddance ""Sybil"" (1976)). Sexual abuse is exploited for some screwy, Nietzschian moralizing regarding that which doesn't kill you only making you stronger. Both the mental illness and the child abuse are tied into Shyamalan's usual pseudo-religious supernaturalism. And, perhaps worst of all, the supernatural here extends to one of the most flagrantly contrived and tacked-on surprise endings when ""Split"" is tied-in to a shared universe with ""Unbreakable"" (2000), via a cameo from Bruce Willis in an utterly stilted scene, and setting up the subsequent cap to the trilogy, ""Glass"" (2019). The coda of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016), another movie about a young woman trapped with a nutcase, almost seems organic by comparison. Perhaps only ""The Mummy"" (2017), in failing to launch the Dark Universe, has done so poorly in recent memory to establish a shared cinematic universe and been such an excruciating example of MCU piggybacking.Of all the divergent threads here, the one I think was promising was the potential self-reflexive allusion to cinema. ""Unbreakable"" succeeded in this respect by reference to comic books, and ""Glass"" extends this further cinematically. Several elements for something similar are presented in ""Split""--beginning with the actor/spectator dichotomy established at the outset with the well-made abduction scene. Although the main girl, Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), is first seen as an object to be viewed, as the other two girls and one of their dads look on, the abduction scene places her firmly as the watcher, or the surrogate spectator for us movie-goers. The other two girls are oblivious nitwits throughout. A series of car mirror shots and obscured views from Casey's point-of-view support this. James McAvoy's madman is the actor in both senses: that his actions tend to advance the plot and that his split personalities form a performance for Casey to observe--whether to see his reinterpretation of Norman Bates from ""Psycho"" (1960) through a crack in a door or to watch him dance by invitation.He also makes webcam movies of his various personalities, which Casey views. In fact, this is what helps set her free. Yorgos Lanthimos made this self-reflexive connection much better in ""Dogtooth"" (2009), another and far-more-disturbing and intelligently-made film about captivity and perversity. In ""Dogtooth,"" the captivity of the characters became a metaphor for the spectator's illusion of being held captive by the film itself. In ""Split,"" however, one wonders whether Shyamalan even meant to do anything that wasn't entirely superficial. For instance, I doubt the reason McAvoy's character has 24 personalities has anything to do with classic film having been photographed at 24 frames per second--especially given how far removed movies are from such standards (like most movies nowadays, ""Split"" is all digital), and, besides, we only see McAvoy portray six of those characters. One could just as well read in an equally pointless exercise in numerology that 24 refers to the number of hours in a day.Additionally, the Beast personality hinted at the promise of ""King Kong"" (1933)-like self-referentiality--where the monster's attack from a stage after being captured by filmmakers suggests his being analogous to cinema. Thus, it might have been intriguing had Casey emerged from beneath a movie theatre instead of--of all things--from a zoo. (They're all held captive--get it?) On second thought, for a movie and script that is this crowded and unfocused--like a zoo, as the idiom goes--that may be the most appropriate setting.","

This movie continues to prove that he still has it, that he's capable of making a great psychological thriller. This movie surrounds James Macavoy's character Henry, well Henry and his 23 identities. Henry suffers from dissociative identity disorder (DID). He is a mental patient who goes to see Dr. Karen Fletcher, played by Betty Buckley. She is increasingly concerned because of urgent emails she keeps receiving from Henry, different identities take Henry over and email her about the urgent situation that's going on. A very dangerous one of Henry's 23 different identities had taken over him and abducted three innocent teenage girls. I absolutely loved the acting performances in this movie. Macavoy is perfect as Henry, and he plays the different identities wonderfully.

Instead of being a horror movie, it's more of a psychological thriller. It builds its atmosphere, and uses it as a weapon to toy with the characters. It employs a subtlety that Shyamalan has lost in some of his latter films. It's a show-don't-tell mindset that allows James McAvoy to shine as his character. McAvoy is absolutely brilliant in this movie. He turns in probably one of the best performances of his career. He completely transforms himself for each personality, really taking on an entirely new character. There are some overt differences between personalities, and then there are some subtle ones. Throughout most of the film, I wasn't seeing McAvoy. I was seeing Hedwig, or Barry, or Patricia. He cultivated these personalities so well and so independently, that you only saw those characters, and not McAvoy. It's hard enough for an actor to lose themselves in one character, let alone close to two dozen. I think Shyamalan and McAvoy share ownership for the brilliance of the performance.

With hints Red Dragon (2002) and echoes of Sybil (1976/2007) with a touch of 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) director, writer M. Night Shyamalan offers an interesting thriller. James McAvoy delivers a performance of a life time as Kevin who has 23 distinct personalities and one additional one, that all play off against each other, even imitating each other at one point. After kidnapping three girls and keeping them locked up in a cellar, surprisingly it is the edgy visits to his therapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher, wonderfully played by Betty Buckley that provide the most tension as you never know when he is going to snap. The slow undercurrent build up is Split's strength as the girls attempt to escape and we get to know many of Kevin's personas, Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / The Beast / Kevin Wendell Crumb / Barry / Orwell / Jade. While McAvoy's 9 year old doesn't ring as true as the other characters he encompasses, the distinction between each is impressive. Especially the 24th personality which builds up like a High Noon (1952) showdown. Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey Cooke has a developed character and poignant story arc but always feel second to McAvoy.The worn on location feel works, a cellar, long corridors, city apartments and a zoo, Shyamalan's realistic setting has become a staple of his work, which helps draw you into the story. Two of the kidnapped girls feel under developed but possibly Shyamalan purposely does this for the viewer to focus on the third and in bid for you to sympathise with her and Kevin.With a Bruce Willis cameo, the post story twist of sorts will be lost on anyone who hasn't seen one particular film of Shyamalan. And to be honest unless you love this particular film or have a great memory, it will probably annoy rather than entice. That said, all that comes before draws the viewer in. Right down to Dr. Fletcher's assessment of what advantage split personalities can have and its application.

Almost two hours long, but it flies by at great pace despite the mostly claustrophobic sequences. The story is well put together, but it's not a horror and nowhere near as creepy as the director's last outing in The Visit. Nor does it give its violent moments real life, which is typical of this director. Only three characters, with the minor parts badly underwritten, and mostly it's a two-hander with an interesting antagonism. A few plot holes, and a couple of implausible plot points involving locks. In the end the director adds a decent twist, but then he reveals his ambition and I was left shrugging my shoulders.I looked forward to the lead actor's performance after his showing in Scum, and he does really well, but the lightweight mood drains his power, and the whole thing falls way short of, say, the basement scenes in Silence Of The Lambs. The lead actress is very good in close up.Music is atmospheric but laid on too thick, especially over some dialogue scenes that should have been more powerful with simple delivery. Photography is good, and the editing and writing keep up an excellent pace.Overall: fascinating premise, but the director wimps out on the horror.",NA
"Mean Girls (2024)","ryanpersaud-59415","17 January 2024","You know when you photocopy something and the copy looks slightly worse? That's how I feel about Mean Girls (2024). It's an impression of the 2004 classic, a sometimes fun one, but ultimately, far worse in every regard.Let's get this out of the way: this is a musical. I's not bad because it's a musical, it's just a bad one. The songs are pretty terrible; I can't remember a single melody from any of them. They all sound overly flat and processed, and mixed terribly. No duets or ensemble songs either; they all feel designed to be pop songs, which is decidedly a TERRIBLE way to write songs for a musical. Secondly, the songs don't advance the plot at all, often focusing on surface level aspects of a scene. Also, the lyrics are just flat out bad. Why start ""Sexy"" as an ode to Halloween, but then completely abandon that fun premise and have it sound like a generic EDM pop song? Why sing Apex Predator that grating way?Not to mention, this film lacks the iconic score and theme music from the original, aside to briefly remind you of the better movie. Most of the scenes at least feel silent and frankly, kind of awkward.Awkward is probably the best way to describe a lot of the performances. Many of them are impressions of the original, and while some are fun: Bebe Wood gives a decent *impression* of Lacey Chabert's Gretchen Weiners, but without the manic intensity. Avantika is cute and funny at times as Karen, but also acts utterly braindead, unlike Seyfried, who really humanized the role. All the characters' base aspects are dialed up to 11, which makes me suspect the writers didn't understand them in the first place.Three stick out: Cady (played by Angourie Rice) made me realize how fantastic Lindsay Lohan was as the character 20 years ago. Lacking an internal narration (given to Damien and Janice, which suits a stage play but not a film), she's a boring and lifeless character, played by Rice, who often seems uncomfortable in the role and frankly, can't sing. Not to mention her relationships with the Plastics and even Janice and Damien never really feel ""real."" The only time she's convincing is when she's pining over Christopher Briney's Aaron Samuels (who is amazingly even less a presence here than in the original).Janice (Auli Cavalho) is perhaps the most illustrative of how thin and weak the writing and performances are. Not only does Cavalho not hold a candle to the biting, punk rock essence of Lizzie Caplan's Janice, but she's an objectively worse character. OG Janice was charming and smart, but we all understood that she still wanted to be liked and was deeply HURT by Regina. Even whilst hating her, she wanted to at least be THOUGHT OF by Regina. Here, predictably, Janice is effortlessly cool, confident, and has none of the internal darkness the original did. Not to mention that they end up making her a lesbian, which defeats the entire point of the character. Janice looked and acted a certain way not because of her sexuality, but because that's who she was. The reveal that she is, in fact, straight, wasn't an indictment of ""lesbianism"". It simply reminds us not to make assumptions about people.And then there's Renee Rap's Regina George. Oh boy. Rachel McAdams wasn't an iconic antaognist because she was ""mean,"" which is what the writers seem to have thought with this new version. She was smart, calculated, extremely aware of her power and privilege, and unafraid to wield it. Renee walks down the halls and sings about how great she is, but never demonstrates the meanness or the power that Regina is SUPPOSED to have. They softened her character to such an extent that it's hard to believe she'd do most of the terrible things people say she did, to be honest. Rap looks like Regina, but she just doesn't hold a candle.The entire script lacks the meanness and bite of the original, which is core to its identity (it was frequently described as a ""dark comedy""). That script was near perfect, so layered with characters, iconic lines, scenes, dynamics...This script feels toned down, toothless, and lame. When they (frequently) redo scenes in this one, they're always worse. When they rewrite scenes, they're always worse. Even the side characters, such an integral part of making Northshore feel REAL, only show up to say their iconic lines and leave. They also, uniformly, look way better than the original people in their roles.The entire point of that casting was to make Mean Girls FEEL real. That ugly and beautiful people coexist in these spaces and unfortunately, there is a hierarchy there. When everyone looks nice, when everyone seems equally confident, when the film doesn't explore the dynamics of the Plastics or the social hierarchy of high school, when the off colour moments like the racial cliques and Coach Karr and Ms. Norberry being a sad divorced lady (and not happily married, in what feels like fan service for the sake of it), the movie just feels like what a lot of modern remakes feel like: lacking the soul of the original. To sum up how bad the writing is, they have Damien literally say ""only Cady could've wrote that,"" in the (admittedly funny) recreation of the final Burn Book scene. A moment that was implied through glances between characters needs to be explained to the audience here.I could go on and on, but this is long enough. Mean Girls 2024 is good for one thing, reminding you of the excellent original and making you want to watch it again.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","AngelHonesty","21 February 2024","A poor imitation of the original. It follows the same plot line and events as the original movie, but does it in a way that it so cringe and painful to watch. The movie felt like a theatrical high school musical play. The musical part did not help the movie in anyway. And some of the songs and scenes were so cringe, like when they pretend to be animals. The movie had a really strong massage about not bullying or putting people down, because we are all just people with feelings at the end of the day...The film moved really quickly because it had to make room for the singing. It was over the top light and airy. The movie feels like it's trying too hard to be funny. If anything the movie felt like a parody, mocking the original film. By the middle of the movie I wanted to walk out, it got so boring and exhausting to watch.The entire film can be summed up in this one message, they push really hard. ""Calling someone ugly is not gonna make you better looking. Calling someone else stupid does not make you any smarter. And as women we have to be able to trust and support each other""","

I mean come on, a cringey modernized musical version that nobody asked for? Why?This version took everything that was original and fresh about the original and puts it to shame, instead of being funny it was focused on cramming every social media platform ever, TikTok?

"Mean Girls (2024)","chenp-54708","12 January 2024","I don't see what's the point of doing another Mean Girls.I enjoyed the original Mean Girls. I thought it was a clever take on the teen genre with fun dialogue and energy and the characters are memorable and hilarious. This adaptation is based on the broadway version of Mean Girls with a new cast (including some recurring actors) and musical numbers. But honestly, even with Tina Fey back, I didn't like it.Throughout, many of the production designs, setting and the direction is solid although it does feel cheap like something from a straight to DVD project. Whether it was intentional to create a stage atmosphere, the cheap quality and production is lacking. The costumes, make-up and the lighting is solid and the direction from the filmmakers, while doing their best to handle the project, feels unbalanced regarding its satirical and comedic tones. The best aspects are the performances as the cast members do a pretty good job on performing their roles. Angourie Rice, Reneé Rapp, Auli'i Cravalho, Christopher Briney and the rest of the cast members bring solid energy to their characters and roles. Regarding the singing, maybe it's because since I haven't seen the Broadway version, I found the musical numbers and singing to be not great and unmemorable as some of the songwriting and musical tones were either mid or pretty clunky.The narrative, with some changes, is pretty much the same as the original but while the writing does try to create something fun, unlike the original, the narrative, chemistry, and energy doesn't feel the same as this one felt bland and derived to what made the original one really good. There were a few humor aspects that I did find to be good but otherwise, weak.I understand this is based on the broadway version and it brings some new energy and grounds to the scene but I don't see what is the point of doing a new version for Mean Girls when the original is already iconic. I can see it being a spin and satirical take on the current era of teen generations but I just feel this new edition feels quite unnecessary.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","pedroquintaoo","13 January 2024","Despite the potential appeal to newer audiences or those unfamiliar with the 2004 original, the film falls short in various aspects. Avantika Vandanapu's performance as Karen Shetty exudes charisma and humor, marking her as a standout in this undesired remake due to her skillful portrayal of Karen's innocence and enthusiasm and that's the only good thing.The majority of the songs are forgettable, repetitive, and dull, detracting from the narrative's depth and diluting the film's intended message. The voices of the actors, barring a few exceptions, compound the film's challenges, making the lackluster songs even more difficult to endure.Angourie Rice's lack of charisma hampers her portrayal of the protagonist, presenting a humorless and personality-deficient version of Cady Heron. Renee Rapp's take on Regina George adds to the setbacks. Despite her efforts, she comes across as a budget-friendly rendition of the original character-cruel but lacking the comedic or iconic presence.In essence, while Vandanapu's performance stands out, the overall experience of the remake is compromised by questionable musical choices and underwhelming character interpretations.","

As soon as the opening scene started I realized I'm going to have a hard time finishing the movie. Why was this like watching a 2 hour TikTok? Why did this have to be a musical? Why were all the songs so bad? Why was the acting so bad? Why were the only good parts about this movie, the parts they just copied from the OG? Which makes it even worse, because that means there was absolutely NO reason for this remake. You would only maybe enjoy it if you have not seen the original so the good jokes are original to you.

"Mean Girls (2024)","zkonedog","20 January 2024","2004's Mean Girls is an all-time classic film. The Broadway musical adaptation of more recent vintage is a solid and engaging adaption of it. This re-framing of the original and the musical is an odd--and largely ineffective--mishmash of the two that needed to ""pick a lane"".For a very basic overview, Mean Girls is a quasi-remake of the '04 original, featuring new-girl-to-school Cady Herron (Angourie Rice) being shepherded by friends Janice (Auli'i Cravalho) & Damian (Jaquel Spivey) through the high school experience--most notably the Plastics trio of Regina George (Renee Rapp) and her minions Karen (Avantika) & Gretchen (Bebe Wood).I'll start with the one piece of good news here: there are just enough entertaining songs in this flick to keep it from being outright boring. ""Revenge Party"" & ""Sexy"" are absolute bangers, and a few others are quite engaging too. There were a few times when I was ready to metaphorically throw in the towel on Mean Girls, but then another song would unspool and keep me hooked a bit longer.The big problem with this sequel/update/reboot, however, is that it tries to have its cake and eat it too. Had this been a ""Mean Girls for the next generation"" flick, I think it would have succeeded wildly. Unfortunately, despite elements of that approach, it is far too ""shot-for-shot-remake"" of the '04 version to tell much of a new story.Or, writer Tina Fey could have simply done a more straight-up adaptation of the Broadway musical--which is fantastic! That show is filled with heart and the proper homage to the original material without being burdened with repetition of it.Sadly, this version tries to walk the beam between the two and ends up tumbling off. It simultaneously feels like an unnecessary remake of the original and an unnecessary clipping of the musical. Not even some great musical numbers can mitigate that.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","vassiliskounelis","21 February 2024","As a fan of the original Mean Girls, I was eager to see how the 2024 remake would reimagine the iconic story. However, this remake fell short of expectations, feeling unnecessary and ultimately disappointing.One of the major missteps was the decision to turn Mean Girls into a musical. While the original film had a perfect blend of humor, wit, and social commentary, the musical adaptation felt forced and out of place. Instead of enhancing the story, the musical elements detracted from the plot and made the entire experience unwatchable.Furthermore, the remake failed to capture the essence of what made the original film so beloved. The characters lacked depth, the humor felt forced, and the plot seemed like a watered-down version of the original. It felt like a shallow attempt to cash in on the success of the original rather than offering anything new or innovative.Overall, Mean Girls (2024) is a disappointing remake that adds nothing of value to the original film. I would not recommend this film, especially to those who have already seen and enjoyed the original. Stick to the original Mean Girls for a truly entertaining and memorable experience.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","writetonight-1","13 January 2024","For those of you who are fans of the Broadway musical, here is a list of the missing music:
""It Roars"" (replaced with a song that's not as good)
""Where Do You Belong?"" (What were they thinking by leaving out this showstopper?!)
""Meet The Plastics"" (Only Regina's first few verses were sung. Gretchen & Karen's parts were cut)
""Fearless""
""Stop"" (Again, what were they thinking by cutting out a showstopper?)
""What's Wrong With Me"" (reprise)
""Whose House Is This?""
""More Is Better""
""Do This Thing""This is supposed to be a film version of the musical, not a remake of the original fetch & flawless film. So, leaving out so many songs was a bad idea. The characters all suffered from this choice; they all seemed too bland.Cady did not sing ""Apex Predator."" Instead, Damian sang ""And though Janice is great, she does not have this power,"" while Janice shrugged. This was such a poor choice, because we didn't see Cady falling under Regina's spell. Gretchen's changing relationship with Regina didn't play out well. The actress who played Gretchen captured the character when she spoke, but when she sang ""What's Wrong With Me"" in Regina's closet, it just didn't make me feel for her. Something got lost in translation.A lot of the comedy was lost in this version. Although ""Sexy"" was filmed well, Karen just wasn't as funny as she was in the 1st movie or the Broadway version. Damian wasn't as funny; without his biggest songs, he didn't shine.""Fearless"" may not have been the biggest hit song, but I felt the loss of it. There needed to be a sharply hit moment when Cady realizes she is the new Queen Bee, freed of her oppressive relationship with Regina. The original film used voiceover to convey that realization and the musical used the song ""Fearless."" The film musical kind of glossed it over.Another thing that was missing was the image of all the plastics walking together, all looking beautiful and glamorous. ""Being in the Plastics was like being famous."" On Broadway, ""Apex Predator"" captured that feel, but in this movie, the song focused on Regina alone and lost the power of the clique.The Plastics just weren't feminine enough. Everyone looked too tough. It was like this version took place at the ""south side"" school that the principal said he left in the original. Even the nerds didn't seem nerdy enough. Regina started out looking like she had already been eating Calteen bars for months and we didn't see her change after Cady tricked her.The chemistry between Cady and Aaron also did not come through. Leaving out ""More Is Better"" and the Aaron's part in ""Stupid With Love"" didn't help.""I See Stars"" was a magical finale on Broadway, but this film did not end with musical magic.What did I like? ""Revenge Party"" was still lots of fun and it was filmed in a colorful way. ""World Burn"" was done well, and ""I'd Rather Be Me"" had a great energy.","

OK, I'm on board with a musical but there are no good songs, at all. There are also no good performances, by anyone.

The creators of this decided that the world has had enough of being mean, gosh darn it, and threw their tantrum as one throws spaghetti at a wall hoping something would stick. What stuck was an overabundance and forced-down-your-throat attempt at diversity and inclusion that, oh by the way, has some plot thing that's glossed over.Seriously. It's nearly 2 hours of ""look at me! I'm special!"" performances that is definitely not a representation of the real world. I wanted to actually see mean girls, not 2 idiots and a leader who is detached from reality. You can even tell that nobody fears these people. Regina George also needs a stylist. These people are called the plastics, but you'd never know. The ""clique"" is very much the sad and pathetic, while the awesome people are caricatures of all the stereotypes you can possibly imagine, unless you're white and straight. Then you're homely, not attractive, and downplayed for loud, obnoxious and flamboyant characters.Avoid this at all costs. There is no message worth searching for as the film is quite clear from the start with their ""yay! Diversity equals everyone's happy!"" I think I'd be less harsh if they didn't advertise this as Mean Girls. It is nowhere near that.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","taybear-21075","12 January 2024","Cady literally could not hold a tune in this MUSICAL movie. Renee was phenominal as well as 90% of the supporting cast. However, I thought that the way they redid the iconic rock songs seemed lazy and the camp theme from the broadway musical just was not hitting the same. Really felt like they were holding back with the jokes and the meanness of the movie. Cady was more unlikable than the main mean girl which is really saying something. The casting of Cady really put a bad taste in my mouth the whole movie - they took the OG songs and gave her parts to other cast members because she couldn't even hold a tune. Whoever her agent is needs to be fired bc why would they put that poor girl in a musical.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","UniqueParticle","20 January 2024","I saw in RPX earlier today which was solid but didn't help much. I'm sure writing most the dialogue was easy since the bulk of it was the same as before with decent musical notes. I should note I hate musicals I just wanted to see this regardless, I'm blessed it was 2 bucks for my RPX ticket with my regal subscription. Positives I should say I still laughed a few times and enjoyed a fair amount; I usually praise nearly everything I watch in this case Mean Girls was a big disappointment! I must say I don't know what they were thinking creating a remake especially as a musical, the plastics weren't as admirable, the acting was worse, and amazing vibes that the 2004 version had just wasn't there in this one! One of the great aspects is 3 original cast members are in this, the rest of the cast was solid. Appreciate my thoughts or not I'm a guy with autism proud of it too.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","aguilera1685","12 January 2024","Caught an advance screening, and 3/4 of the people around me agreed - it was just ok, but not good. NO HATE, but 90% was a downgrade from the original complex and multilayered material where everyone, down to cast with just one line, delivered absolute STAR power. In 20 years since that original, a lot has evolved within the high school arena, so production naturally had to tweak some things to make it work. Some of it works, much doesn't.Judging on its own merits, I feel it simply would work better on a stage, and that the biggest fault lied with Casting, who hired *singers* who needed more time with acting coaches. I'd probably like it in a stage setting. BUT, this is the silver screen - and the magnifying glass is much less forgiving.The biggest offender for me - and seriously NO HATE because she seems super lovely and may just be better suited in other things - was Karen. Every moment with her was eyeroll inducing. The acting was actual amateur high school production level (at best) cliche ditz caricature with zero nuance. Gretchen lacked any energy or drive, or that absolutely obsessive DESPERATE need to be needed by her queen - she was instead very pedestrian. Not a member of the queens herself but just a follower. And that Queen (Regina) didn't give me the level of commanding stone cold respect and fear in the student body like the OG did. While the actress is very beautiful and talented, she didn't deliver on the respect-demanding queen bee of the school for me. It felt like a Nickelodeon show or something. The trio all fell so flat - they weren't QUEENS of the school who everyone bowed down down to and lived in fear of, they're actually just the wannabe girls who would have worshipped and aspired TO BE that original trio.I truly didn't understand the change of Jingle Bell Rock at all and how the school was so quickly able to turn on Regina when she essentially suffers an actual big accident on stage and people are then essentially posting upskirt vid of it. Baffling and unrealistic. Hit by a bus is the bar to be deserving of pity but not the stage mishap? Uhhok. Damien's song choice change however? Hilarious. Getting diarrhea on a Ferris wheel is way too extreme and actually mortifying vs the previous nuanced ""at Barnes and Noble"" where it would be just embarrassing for the character knowing her friends knew. The difference between overly dramatic teen girls and everyone in real life. Overshot on that one. And while Tina and Tim being in a relationship is a fun evolution on their flirty repartee in the original, Ms Norbury's divorce and life-in-shambles aspect brought a lot in to the character. Although hilarious, she's more one-dimensional now.I'm sorry but Aaron Samuels is supposed to be *h-o-t-t* and he's just a regular guy. There's no context to make him so desired by the Queen of the school and it makes no sense. It's like the character of Guy in Never Been Kissed - the movie wants us to believe he's a heartthrob but doesn't give us the goods to do so. Why casting was so forgiving when he doesn't even bring singing talent leaves me scratching my head. And Busy Philipps, who I normally enjoy, felt like a one-dimensional cardboard cutout of the role that Amy Poehler gave so many layers to, a total tour de force and showstealer.Damien and Janis were fine actors and good singers, though I would have liked them to feel like more of outcasts. Janis was punk and glam and fierce, not a social outcast. With this generation being more accepting of alternative lifestyles and less inclined to outright bully and ostracize, I understand how that presented a challenge to the filmmakers, but they didn't deliver at accomplishing it, and I feel thats integral to the story.NOW, for the GOOD, Cady had excellent energy and played her role well in both acting and singing. Grand slam there. Tina Fey was effective at changing Ms Norbury enough to keep it fresh, while allowing for things that were omitted to not be mourned - bravo! The bit like she was about to break into song but was just clearing her throat was a riot. I also really appreciated this slightly elevated version of Regina post-accident. Being drugged up and having a resolution wth Cady and being loopy at the Spring Fling was a fresh and funny take. And obviously, it was great to see the cameos and Easter eggs- Lindsay saying this has only happened once before, the cutout tanktop brief flash, etc.Obviously, with more negative takes than positive, I understand people won't be happy or agree with my assessment, but it's just the reality of how I felt. NO hate towards this very vocally talented cast, I wish them all the best in their future works!!! But I don't feel any need to revisit this one. It turns out, the limit does, in fact, exist - and it's just 1. But decide for yourself.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Tayyasqueen","26 February 2024","I absolutely love the original Mean Girls. It's a damn classic. This new one was difficult for me to watch. The mean is too mean somehow? Regina and all the other characters in the original were more subtle and comedically with it. I love Renee Rapp and only watched for her, but the film let me down. It feels like there is no life and depth to the characters. Maybe with the musical numbers, there simply is not enough time to develop and go deeper into their stories. It feels flat and was difficult to get through. With that said, the actresses and actors are beautiful, and the film is visually well executed!","

The new version of Mean Girls, by using so many musical scenes that look like video clips, forgets to give adequate development to the characters. They look one-dimensional, flat. Unlike the original, which was a good movie because of the good construction of characters.They focused too much on the musical and the film has narrative gaps and potholes. Empty and plastic.You leave the room and immediately forget about it.An unnecessary remake.Everything good that the 2004 version had does not appear anywhere here.Although Angourie Rice is a good actress and a good choice for the lead, she can't do much with a script that doesn't offer much to her.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","kevin_robbins","15 January 2024","My wife and I caught Mean Girls (2024) in theaters last night. This musical tells the story of a girl homeschooled in Africa who returns to the U. S. and faces the challenges of high school - navigating cliques, understanding popularity, and trying to survive.This picture is codirected by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. (Where Have All the Flowers Gone), and stars Angourie Rice (The Nice Guys), Reneé Rapp (The Sex Lives of College Girls), Jaquel Spivey, Avantika (Senior Year), Christopher Briney (The Summer I Turned Pretty), Tina Fey (Date Night) and Tim Meadows (The Ladies Man).This musical rendition of ""Mean Girls"" is brilliant, showcasing some characters, songs, and circumstances that outshine others. Overall, it's a worthwhile experience. Reneé Rapp, Avankita, and Bebe Wood shine, rivaling or even surpassing ""The Plastics"" from the original. Angourie Rice delivers a solid performance, though less compelling than Lindsay Lohan, and Christopher Briney holds his own. The entire cast is stunning, and Jaquel Spivey delivers an amazing breakout performance. The ""Cautionary Tale"" opening and the two songs during the costume sequence stand out, along with the ""wild animals"" high school scene. The sets, attire, and props are impeccably chosen, making the unfolding story enjoyable despite its predictability.In conclusion, Mean Girls may not reach the heights of the original, but its comedy and solid delivery of musical numbers make it a must-see. I'd score this a 7-7.5/10 and strongly recommend it, especially for fans of the original movie.","

I would not suggest watching this unless it's free bc it was a waste of money. I was really hoping it wouldn't be as bad as the 2nd mean girls movie.....& it was. They tried to be too serious and funny at the same time but the most funny part of the original movie is that they didn't take anything seriously. I didn't really like that it was a musical it gave a corny vibe. Not because they weren't talented singers but more because a lot of the cast was better singers than actors. I did like some actors.

The original is way better and has better pacing than this version. Plus 80% of the actors are not fit for the roles they got. It's also missing the best part which is the original Christmas show dance. Some of the meta jokes were fun but they didn't space them out enough. The mean girls were not mean enough and it seems they were very afraid of offending which I get but this feels like they put safety guards on bullying. Also the lesson is punched so in face you can't not understand it and made me feel like they thought I am stupid.","

The plot, the cast, the jokes, the singing - nothing made sense when put together. It was so bad I'm not sure what to even write here.

Overall, a mediocre retelling of an iconic movie as it feels like a musically modern imitation rather than a remake, and it does not help that the musical numbers are not that well executed.Pretty Bad Direction (The direction macroscale was kinda poor because the musical numbers were not the best choreographed and the world wasn't built well; the direction on a microscale felt like an imitation of the original 'Mean Girls' movie but with a modern twist; the direction of actors was decent as most of the performances stayed true to the course (though just not as good as the original); the storytelling was decent as they used the audience's knowledge of the previous story and coupled with musical numbers to move to plot forward (which ultimately replaces the narration and straightforward style of the original)), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Good from Angourie Rice (Holds her own and shows some promise as a singer (but does not have the same charm as Lindsay Lohan)), Pretty Good from Reneé Rapp (Embodies the character well and has a good singing voice (but just does not stand out as Rachel McAdams iconic performance)), Good from Auli'i Cravalho (Mostly on par with Lizzy Caplan's performance and has the best vocal performance in the entire cast), Decent from Christopher Briney (Not as good as the original character but holds his own well), Pretty Good to Good from Tina Fey (Continues to pretty much play herself and other characters she's played), Pretty Good to Good from Tim Meadows (Feels like he is doing an impersonation of his previous performance (though he still is memorable in his own right)), Good from Jaquel Spivey (The only performance that was truly better than the original as he has a great sense of comedic timing and a good vocal performance (when he's given the chance)), Pretty Bad from Jenna Fischer (Just feels off and not in time with Angourie Rice), Decent from the rest of the cast (While the performances are not as good as the original, everyone holds their own as there is no real sour performance that stands out)), Decent to Pretty Good Story (The story is basically a musically modern retelling of 'Mean Girls' as there are no deviations from the original plot; the plot structure was actually better as they cut out some of the unnecessary exposition and put more emphasis on the climax; flow between sequences was decent; the character writing was the same as the original (providing nothing new)), Pretty Good Screenplay (The dialogue was basically a modern version of the original (with them putting more emphasis on the iconic lines); the humor was decently on par with the original (but there is less charm because it reuses a lot of the same jokes), the movie has the best joke if you combine both of the movies; the symbolism is pretty shallow and the message is pretty predictable (the movie is pretty simple in itself, so it really shouldn't be taken that seriously); the foreshadowing is nonexistent because the songs make reference to key points from the end (with the overall movie being just fan service)), Decent Score/Pretty Bad Soundtrack (A lot of the songs were just stupid and tried to force in references from the original movie, though there are some songs I did like), Bad Cinematography (Incredibly nauseating and just felt very cheap (seen in the musical numbers) and amateurish (especially when they would cut between full and widescreen)), Pretty Bad Sound (Felt kinda cheap and felt similar to how other musicals mix in sound), Bad Editing (Tacky and cheap as it tries to emulate the 2020s social media era), Decent Production Design (Tried to emulate the original movie), Pacing was a good pace for the whole movie (this time they fixed the pacing issues towards the end), Climax was executed better this time around as they had more time to play with and had a good build-up (felt more balanced overall and ended where it should), Tone is very different from the original (and this is mostly seen with them replacing the narration with musical numbers), The marketing for this movie was a big issue because they made Regina act like the main character and barely included Cady (even though Cady still is the protagonist)","

"Mean Girls (2024)","superfox_888","25 February 2024","Good musicals use songs to forward a narrative. Bad musicals tell a story, stop to sing about it, then continue the narrative before stopping to sing about it again.This film does the latter. Just like Heathers: The Musical, they have taken a perfect film, shoved a bunch of songs in there which add nothing, just to repackage existing IP and sell it to fans of the original. The charm from the original film is severely lacking here.I liked the actors playing Janis and Damien. Everyone else seemed like they were reciting lines for a high school read-through. Angourie Rice was a competent Cady before the Plastics version; after becoming Queen Bee she was still caught in the before version, lacking charisma needed for the role.This version encapsulates the narcissist generation where everyone is the Main Character on their own social media, which is great for an update of the film. There are other things I liked about it, but they are few and far between.","

To see a musical I really enjoyed be changed in almost every aspect just left a bad taste in my mouth. Almost half of the songs were cut (leaving us with about 12 songs, which is odd considering this is a musical) and the songs that were not cut were changed, whether that be in the lyrics, tempo or both. I wish we could have just gotten a stage recording or a remake of the original mean girls movie. Instead we're just left with this mess. I did appreciate the Lindsay Lohan cameo though.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","AfricanBro","20 January 2024","Two really elderly gentlemen came to the early release and I thought that was adorable. Anyway so, I watched the 2004 one, I was kinda shocked the new one's a musical. I don't think I'd have gone to see this if I knew. The '04 had a better start, I really liked the rifle joke. Though I didn't plan on comparing them extensively, they're so similar that it feels more like a remake for the new generation than paying homage.I like that it retained the same teachers, with the principal still dealing with the same arm issue, and the slang 'fetch' persisting. Many elements remained unchanged, making it more of a remake, as mentioned. I have mixed feelings about Reneé Rapp as Regina; having seen her in 'The Sex Lives of College Girls,' I felt like I was watching Leighton Murray's high school experience before college.In other ways I'm glad I watched the first mean girls so I got references but in other ways it'd be better if you forgot about it before now. Maybe watching this with a vague memory, because I had finished watching Lindsay Lohan's mean girls literally 20min before going to see the new one.Songs were great and I'm not a musical person, but I got tired of them after a while. Also, I'm unsure if the remake was overdone; now I don't know any high schoolers to confirm if it's an accurate portrayal of Gen Z, but it felt exaggerated. The first Mean Girls felt more believable and relatable, maybe you didn't see yourself in any specific characters but you could've known someone like them from high school.I don't like musicals and just like most of them I think the movie would've been fine and shorter if it was just normal film with no singing. However because it's so similar to the first one which was such a huge success, I guess it needed something to set it apart. Especially since it follows similar character tropes, stories and quotes, so I might not like musicals but it made sense.A good laugh I got was the coach going ""she should be lifting through her glutes."" I love how it integrated 'TikTok' culture for modern day, because that made me think of all the gym pundits who're always reacting to stuff and criticizing form. However I was the only one who burst out laughing in the theater at that part. But generally the movie did get laughs elsewhere. Like the Teacher, Tina Fey trying to sing was hilarious.It's pretty predictable because the bulk of the story is mostly the same. Lindsay Lohan cameo was a nice touch. I love Amanda Seyfried, but I think Avantika played The dumb girl really well, it was hilarious. It's the one bit of this film I think it did better than the first, she was written better.Overall, I think the first one is obviously better, but this remake is respectable. No one was asking for it. I enjoyed it more than expected, though it might not reach the cultural phenomenon status of the original, I think that'll probably go to Barbie.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","braydentrinkleuk","17 January 2024","As someone who knew the original Broadway Musical before watching this movie, I was expecting a lot. The musical definitely outshines the movie far more and so if a good recreation was done it would be phenomenal. Unfortunately, it was a mess. There were lots of poor acting choices that I would blame directing for like Karen not just being an idiot but apparently she now can't pay attention to anyone. It would've been fine if it was left to occasional spacey moments but this girl constantly looks blank. The cinametography was also poor with many extreme close up shots that did not help portray anything. There was only one of these shots which was actually done well nearing the end of the movie. Another problem was that all of the vocals felt fake for the most part, while the actresses playing Cady and Regina sounded okay but there were obvious auto-tuning which made it annoying to listen to. Many of the best songs were cut short or had lost content, like Meet the Plastics. My last problem is that big changes were made to Gretchin which basically make all the jokes originally for her fall flat. Gretchen was originally Jewish, likely Ashkenazi. The joke about her hair is because it's so puffy and curly, this joke doesn't really make sense with a straight haired girl who has little volume to her hair naturally. I think they also try hinting at her being Spanish? In the start to the song Whats Wrong With Me. It just kind of made me feel weird to see them take out something so little but still so important to a character.","

Then I saw the previews and I thought to myself - wait a second who the hell needs a mean girls musical...but some of the new one liners were kind of funny so I thought I'd give it a go!The movie is jumbled, the best part of the original is that we got to watch Cadys transcendence into tyranny and this movie made it seem like it just happened overnight-While dragging out other plot lines unnecessarily. They changed enough of the movie to not call it remake and tried to appeal to the younger, less funny and more sensitive generation... I feel like there were too many plot holes because they heavily relied on people remembering the first one and didn't try too hard to connect the dots.Cady - good acting and depiction of the original but has no genuine emotion or likability
Regina - the actress is great but doesn't bring the full mean girl energy of the original
I would have liked to see the actresses who played Karen and Gretchen switched , the actress who played Gretchen didn't bring it at all and is most unbelievable
Of them all.I did enjoy seeing Tina, Fe,The music was just okay not catchy or memorable... The music had a highschool musical undertone but pushed for the pg-13 rating

"Mean Girls (2024)","ferguson-6","10 January 2024","Greetings again from the darkness. High School is a challenging time. High School girls can be mean, especially to each other. Those two points were made quite clearly in the 2004 film MEAN GIRLS, written by the brilliant Tina Fey and directed by Mark Waters. The film struck a chord with that generation both emotionally and through vocabulary. Society has seen many changes since 2004, but evidently High School is still challenging, and High School girls are still often mean. That film was adapted for a musical stage production in 2017, and now that Broadway musical has been adapted back to the big screen for a new generation. Tina Faye returns as screenwriter (and as math teacher Ms. Norbury), and the new film is co-directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr.This is my first sojourn into MEAN GIRLS territory. Of course, I have come across 'mean' girls in real life, but I have not watched the 2004 film, the 2011 sequel (a TV movie), or the live musical production. Angourie Rice (THE NICE GUYS, ""Mare of Easttown"") plays Cady Heron, the home-schooled girl who transfers to North Shore High when she and her mother (Jenna Fisher) relocate from Kenya. Excited for her new adventure, yet uncomfortable as the new kid, Cady is schooled on the social hierarchies (cliques) by artsy Janis (Auli'I Cravahlo, the voice of MOANA) and proud gay Damian (a talented Jaquel Spivey). Most of the education revolves around ""The Plastics"", a trio of snooty girls: the not smart Karen Shetty (Avantika), the desperate to be seen Gretchen Wieners (Bebe Wood), and their leader and school villain, wealthy diva Regina George (Renee Rapp in the role made famous by Rachel McAdams).Regina takes an interest in Cady (a near clone of Amy Adams) and high school life devolves into the mess that it too often is. Cady falls for hot boy and fellow Calculus classmate Aaron (Christopher Briney, DALILAND). This immediately changes the dynamics since Aaron is Regina's ex. Petty jealousies intensify and personalities shift wreaking more havoc on relationships that were never very deep. Brief supporting roles are covered by Jon Hamm as the clueless coach and health teacher, Ashley Park (""Beef"") as a teacher, an over-the-top Bijou Phillips as Regina's mom, and Tim Meadows as the fed-up Principal. Meadows is the only actor to appear in all three MEAN GIRLS movies, and he and Tina Fey each nail a couple of zingers. And yes, you can expect a couple of cameos.The intended message is valuable and delivered clearly, however, for a musical, it's the songs that often seem weak and sometimes forced. A couple of the songs land, but most miss the mark. Renee Rapp nails her song at the Halloween Party, and Auli'I Cravahlo is truly a standout when she gets the opportunity to showcase that voice. ""Gruel"" and ""fetch"" are recycled here for effect, and though the songs are a bit disappointing, we do hope the message is received by a new generation (even if most of these actors look like they should be out of college, rather than clunking through high school).Opens nationwide in theaters on January 12, 2024.","

For example, why did you cut Damion's songs Where Do You Belong and Stop? They even cut the whole scene where Damion tried to save Cady from herself. That's pretty important to the storyline.Why did you get rid of Mr. Herron? Neil Flynn did a great job in the first movie.

I used the time that i did spend there answering my emails. Excessive stereotyping of diversity - even the songs are not singable the mostly teenage theatre audience seemed to not enjoy the show.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","jp_91","11 January 2024","To celebrate 20 years of the teen classic ""Mean Girls"", this musical adaptation of the same name comes and the result is very good. At first you can't help but make comparisons with the original film, but once you adjust to the fact that times change, the film is a delight. The script does not go out of style, the message is still present and the question of whether it has really achieved a change in the high school world is still without a concrete answer. Most of the musical numbers are excellent in lyrics and the choreography accompanied by good camera movements gives magnificent results. The performances of the new cast are totally acceptable, and it should be noted that Tina Fey shines again in her character, for their part, the actresses who play the new plastic girls give remarkable performances, Angourie Rice plays very well with the personalities of her character, Reneé Rapp plays a superb Regina George with a femme fatale style, Bebe Wood demonstrates her acting talent as a material teenager with fragile feelings and Avantika is fun and realistic as a giddy girl, it should be noted that all of them have good voices and they demonstrate it in the musical themes, but the one who gives the best performance of the entire cast is Auli'i Cravalho who demonstrates an intensity acting of emotions and a magnificent voice in each song she performs. A different movie with the same feeling as the teen classic from the '00s.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","s_sahar99","21 February 2024","All the characters are obnoxious, crude, and uninspiring. Why is this a musical? Like whose idea was this? Is it because it's a Disney movie? Also, why is this Gen Z content so hard to watch. I just just clueless and notting hill which were exquisite and actually a breath of fresh air. They teach all about chivalry and ideals. The characters are pleasant to watch and the writing is good. This is to point out how awful this movie is. Why are they trying so hard? Perhaps because they ran out of ideas and are just mimicking the movies from the past. If this is a remake, it's a terrible adaption. If this is about feminism, it's garbage. These 'mean girls' are the shallowest people who truly give off a narcissistic, dim-witted, superioty complex that is very unbearable. A solid thumbs down for this piece of unforgettable remake!!!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","jdrendinell10","15 January 2024","Let's get the the obvious out of the way: was this better than the original? Absolutely not, but that's to be expected because the original was iconic. However, as far as a ""reboot"" or ""remake"" goes, I don't think you could ask for much better than this.I can argue that this movie had a bit more depth to it, from giving Cady more of a backstory to giving each main character their own song to highlight different aspects of that character. I've never seen the Broadway musical, so I can't speak to how many songs they did or didn't do and all of that, but each performance was extremely well done. I particularly enjoyed Auli'i Cravalho's solo being one continuous shot, or the choreography in Reneé Rapp's halloween party song. The casting department absolutely nailed it, and it was especially fun that Lindsay Lohan, Tina Fey, and Tim Meadows all returned. Additionally, there were some great Easter eggs (did anyone notice the cut out shirts from the original as one of the Halloween costume Karen tossed aside) and included all of the iconic lines from the original (you go Glen Coco!)My biggest hot take that no one will agree with? Reneé was a better Regina George than Rachel McAdams. I said what I said.7.8/10.","

But with this film I am so confused on what the thought process was there. Tina Fey is an amazing writer, she brought us the iconic 2004 Mean Girls. And trust me I get making one based of the broadway show but they have taken MUSICAL too literally this year and have a song in literally every scene so every 2 minutes or less there is a song and we walked out not even half way through the ""revenge song.""I was highly upset after I walked out because I am against it, I feel as if they tried to modernize something that did not need to be, changing POV's of the characters was a good change but the movie is line from line of the Original and I only know this because I have watched that version so much over the past 20 years. I do not condone walking out but Its was cringy and did not give that wonderful nostalgic feel, what makes it worse I didn't even make it to the point of seeing the rest of the OG actors like Lindsay Lohan and many more who came back to act in this movie.I will say the production was amazing and well put together in the sense of being able to follow along but all the songs took away from an amazing story, the singers were great they do have amazing voices I just wish there were less cringy songs and awkward moments since the love interest was noooowhere near as smooth as the original.","

In fact, I think it's a little too musical for my tastes-I liked the 2004 version better. The story line is basically the same as the original. Angourie/Cady is home schooled in Africa and starts regular high school, unfamiliar with all the clicks. Renee/Regina is the leader of the Plastics-the hot girls. Auli'i/Janis-a member of the Outcasts-warns Angourie to stay away from Renee's group but later, wants her to infiltrate them and report back to her on her findings. Christopher/Aaron is the boy Angourie falls for but he has a past with Renee. Tim Meadows and Tina Fey return and there is a quick cameo by Lindsay Lohan.It's rated PG-13 for language, teen drinking and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you liked the original, it would be alright to stream. Otherwise, I'd wait until it comes to regular tv.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","barbett-1","14 January 2024","The new iteration of Mean Girls is a very entertaining movie. The songs are great as are the performances by a young and talented lead cast. Renee Rapp and Angourie Rice sing and act wonderfully as the rival Plastics but, in my opinion, Auli'i Cravalho stole the show as the outcast girl, Janis. I came to the theater not expecting a musical, but ended up pleasantly surprised by the energetic singing and choreography. Despite the musical emphasis, the film still retains the wry, somewhat subversive wit of the original. While I enjoyed the original, this is one of those rare instances where the remake is clearly a quality production. It is a real treat if you enjoy musical.","

On top of that, most of the actors completely failed to deliver the lines and fell completely flat. Sure, it's supposed to be an adaptation of the broadway musical, but even in that context, it was executed poorly.This just came off as a tired cash grab, to bank off the success of the OG movie and the broadway musical, without any effort being put into it at all.

"Mean Girls (2024)","Padreviews","18 January 2024","As always I go to see a film knowing nothing about it and with no expectations. I knew of a film called mean girls with Lindsay Lohan but knew nothing about as I'd never seen & didn't even know there was a musical of it but then again they make a musical of everything these days , there probably Jurassic Park the musical with dancing dinosaurs somewhere that turns out to be a love story! So I judged this on its merits as I saw , and seeing other reviews it appears many fans of either the musical or the 2004 original we're expecting something else and didn't really give it a chanceMy title refers to the song 'I'd rather be me' this was the point where the film notched up a gear from an average or above average 7/10 to 8/10 & then later in the film when the moral story comes out it finishes on a high 9/10.So what's it about ? Well you know I never give spoilers but let's just say it's about the moral maze at a high school where you have the cool kids , the nerds , and the individuals and it's about the way they interact with each other with a little bit of romance thrown in , think Grease , though the musical numbers here seemed more detached than being part of the narrativeIs it worth seeing ? Yes - it's a fun film with morals & a bit of comedy and romance thrown in - it's also very techie & will appeal to the tik tok generationLindsay lohan made a cameo & Pam from the American office was great as the mum . Both lead female roles were great & the story of their battle for the leader of the pack proved a great plot for the storylineGo see it without high expectations & you might enjoy as much as I didIt was better than Barbie - I was expecting it to be as bad!Pad. A 9/10.","

And i LOVED the movie! I listened the soundtrack before seeing it, and HATED it. But it actually worked really well on screen. There were so many new jokes that made me laugh out loud. I thought they did an amazing job modernizing the film.Angourie Rice is a really good Cady. I know they slowed her songs and lowered the key, but i thought it worked on screen. She fit the role so well.Reneé Rapp is the loml. I rememeber when she took over as Regina on broadway. She is SO good. Her voice!!!!!! And the way she played Regina was amazing. Someone Gets Hurt was insanely good. And i got full body CHILLS during World Burn.Auli'i Cravalho is by far my favorite version of Janis. She played her so well, and her voice is INCREDIBLE. Seriously, i've never liked Janis's character until now.Jaquel Spivey was so funny as Damien. His take on the character was hilarious, and his voice is so good. He did a vocal run in Revege Party that gave me chills.Avantika STOLE THE SHOW OMG. She is SO funny and cute. She was a perfect Karen. Though, i do think ""sexy Joan of Arc"" is much more offensive than ""sexy Rosa Parks""😭😭😭Bebe Woods was cute as Gretchen. I actually hated Whats Wrong With Me in the original musical, but i found myself enjoying it on screen. Sad they cut the Ceasar monologue, she would've ate that.Christopher Briney was Aaron Samuels. Thats a fact. He didnt sing??? He wasnt bad, though. His acting was good. Ive never like Aaron's character.Jenna Fischer, Tina Fey, and Tim Meadows were all amazing.And the cameos from Lindsay Lohan and Ashley Park made me scream. So excited about that.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","KFstudios2009","25 February 2024","Mean Girls, directed by Tina Fey, the actress in the original Mean Girls and now back to direct and play in the remake, isn't a good movie at all. It had small details that I appreciated a lot and that's why I was so kind and gave it a higher rating. Tina Fey is probably an ok actress, she has played in a bunch of movies that you have probably heard of, but I don't know how she got the idea to direct this. What was she thinking? What was Paramount thinking in producing this crap? Let's mention the cast first. Angourie Rice in the main role as Cady Heron tried to be as funny and convincing as possible to be the shy, innocent girl that moves into the new, crowded school, yet she is so plastic (And I mean literally plastic) that she just destroyed the atmosphere. By an hour or so you get used to her and forget about it, yet it is still a big problem. The supporting roles does something, but not much. At least they did a good job with showing the different groups and separations, and how hard it can be to try to fit in, and that message was very strong here, and I think maybe two of my stars goes to the moral. Now let's mention our truly beloved director Tina that makes the movie. Her idea of it, in terms of camera angles, music and set-up, felt very unprofessional. The camera filming was hilarious. There was that one angle when someone runned and was holding the camera, so 90 percent of the face came on the screen. And the montage, cuts, didn't have that smooth flow. Sometimes they tried to make a transition through one scene to another, but as I mentioned, it didn't have that smooth movement. But I mentioned small details I liked, so I can say it right away. About when it's a Halloween party someplace in the film, two friends are watching a horror movie, and they decided to put in a scene from Friday the 13th: Part II, that I really appreciated. Small details like that makes the movie a little bit more watchable, and also, Friday the 13th is one of my favorite horror franchises, also coming from Paramount Pictures. Now there is the last thing I didn't mention, probably the most important part of the musical, the songs! Of course, the songs, what about them? Nothing. It was really nothing, garbage, didn't have the beat, probably written by Ai or something, and I think the authors wrote the songs like that on purpose. You know, to annoy the audience. So ok, should you watch Mean Girls the musical remake? No. A waste of time, nothing worth your energy, and now you have been warned.","

We got 15 minutes in before she said ""please turn it off, this is awful"". ""Thank God"" I said and gratefully complied.Every element was a gaudy yet impressively poor imitation of their original. The musical score was awful (do people really want to listen to this tuneless rubbish?). I assume the score is from the newish Musical? We'd planned to go see it but honestly it'll be a cold day in hell before I put myself through that willingly based on this car crash.It feels cheap, sounds cheap, production values aren't great and has an over whelming air of amateurism.This whole movie should be written off as misadventure and everyone involved should probably be quietly deleting its existence from their CV's.

Sure it was funny and decently entertaining however, I still don't think it's worth its own Broadway adaptation. I'm also not a fan of musicals in general. So those are two very important factors that could have influenced my dislike this movie, but actually, no. I dislike it cos it's just a disappointing movie.It's almost the same movie as the original, but with none of the charm that made it so memorable. The music is not bad, and that's about the only positive thing I could say. The plot feels incredibly rushed, so much so that it feels like the movie relies on you having watched the original to make up for any missing context. The characters are just not that compelling either - with Cady following a script, the Plastics not being all that mean and Damian and Janis coming across as borderline uncaring and selfish. It feels like an unnecessary movie altogether and does very little to convince you otherwise.That being said, I don't think it's unenjoyable. The high points of this movie being the songs and the vivid choreography does enough to carry it through. Unfortunately, that by itself isn't enough to make a good movie.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","parksiet","13 January 2024","There's no Mean Girls quite like the original Mean Girls, but I can't deny that I had a lot of fun here! I don't see a scenario where you don't enjoy this if you loved both the original movie and the musical. Sure, it doesn't change anything much from the original material's storyline, but it honestly doesn't really need to. It's a fun watch with a fantastic cast - Auli'i Cravalho and Jaquel Spivey steal the show! Reneé Rapp and Angourie Rice were also excellent, I genuinely thought everyone fit their roles really well. Unfortunately as good as the cast is, they pale in comparison to the original cast. The movie as a whole could be read as a pale imitation of a better movie - it's basically the original with musical numbers added in. It's goofier and less incisive than the original, lacking a lot of the bite the 2004 films had, but still has some fun moments. I love Tina Fey, but damn she just recycled exact dialogue. It was like 80% identical, including a lot of the jokes, spoken by actors who are too aware of the original material to be able to deliver it in any way that can be considered fresh. The movie worked best when it wasn't trying to just recreate iconic moments from the original and instead just did its own thing. I think my biggest issue with the movie is that it avoids doing any of the character work the original did, instead opting to assume the audience knows these characters and what they want already - just going through the motions of the story, iconic moment after iconic moment.But what the hell? You know me, I love musicals! I had fun! I thought it was good! I've had the songs stuck in my head since I saw it! People in the theatre were laughing and enjoying it! Sure at times I saw the streaming film it was intended to be, but I am so glad it got upgraded to a theatrical release as this is a movie worthy of seeing on a big screen with an audience!Not since Rob Marshall and Chicago has a feature film debut shown such a confident, innate understanding of the musical genre and how to make it cinematic for a modern audience. You can tell this is the directors' first feature, but it's a good first feature, with a lot of creativity especially with the camera, lighting, and staging of the musical sequences. Coming from the perspective of someone who adores the 2004 film but never got the chance to see the Broadway show - I was really blown away by the music-such memorable songs and so well woven into the story. I wouldn't say it's the best musical out there, but it worked for this! The film feels charmingly familiar but also alive in a fun, fresh way. I liked it; Mean Girls (2024) is a fun, fetch way of rewatching the original!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","cahidi","4 March 2024","When I heard that Tina Fey is remaking Mean Girls into a musical, I was kinda excited. But after watching it, I have to be honest, it's kinda underwhelming. I'm not an expert at criticizing movies, so I can't exactly tell you what didn't work. All I know is that several things were changed. Like how Cady doesn't have a Dad in this version. I personally think that it ruined the happy family dynamic that Cady once had before she turned into a Plastic. Thus diminishing the conflict with her mother when crap hits the fan. They also shift some things around like how Janis took Cady under her wings on Cady's first day of school. She's also got into the Plastics that same day. It kinda rushed the story, since in the original version, nothing happened in the first day. They also omitted several funny stuff like how when Cady tried to get Aaron to go to the place where Regina was cheating on him, it turned out to be the Coach and one of his female students. And like how the Jingle Bell's Rock dance which went sideways when Gretchen accidentally kicked the boom box into her boyfriend's face. Funny little things like those can ruin things if you remove them. They also removed the scene which showed the audience that all the girls have made peace. And that's a minus too, at least for me. The only thing I like is that scene where Cady and Regina forgave each other. That didn't happen in the original version. I don't wanna be mean, so I added another star to my original rating, for Tina Fey.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","willphelan","15 January 2024","This film failed to justify its own existence. This remake keeps a lot of jokes from the original movie but doesn't execute them as well. The film also gets rid a lot of the original film's funniest jokes. It seems like most of the jokes they removed were the ones that could be seen as controversial or offensive but that's the whole point. The characters are supposed to be dumb and mean so removing those jokes hurts the characterization. There are a couple new jokes that hit but not enough. The cast here is simply not as good as the original, especially when it comes to Regina George. Renee Rapp is fine but she's no Rachel McAdams. Her version of the iconic character is nowhere near as interesting or memorable. The film feels like is rushes through the story unlike the original movie which had excellent pacing and a tight script. This could be due to the musical numbers which I normally wouldn't mind but the music here isn't anything special. The costumes here aren't very good. They seem cheap and it doesn't feel like the plastics would wear these outfits. The original Mean Girls is so good and the general story still follows over here so there's a little fun to be had, but the film falls completely flat in every aspect when compared to the original masterpiece. I don't know why they don't just make a true sequel to the original film already because that's what people actually want to see. 5/10.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","soulfx-1","7 February 2024","The original is a classic and is relatable to different generations because it's a story about acceptance, social pressure on teens to fit in and around identity - the same things that make Breakfast club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off great to countless generations that have watched them.This reboot sadly misses the mark, focusing too much on very Gen Z specific experiences that I don't think are relatable to anyone - let alone Gen Z itself.Very little time is focused on character development, and it feels like they rushed the pacing to squeeze in the musical numbers into the original movie. The writing is a bit jjilted and all the charm of the original movie appears to be lost in this remake.I'd skip it.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","movieman6-413-929510","13 January 2024","Mean Girls is a remake of the 2004 film of the same name. This remake was created by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. This remake focuses more on the Mean Girls musical.Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is independent from Africa, where she was homeschooled. Now she is going to a new school where her time has to be precious with other students. In this way she learns about the different types of groups of students that can be found at a secondary school.Cady is quickly seen and accepted by the popular girl group ""the Plastics"". Everything seems to be going well, until Cady starts to have feelings for Regina George's ex (Reneé Rapp), the alpha of the Plastics. In this way she breaks a rule of the group, which can get her into trouble. This is why Cady is now trying to turn things around and destroy the Plastics from within the group. Now she just has to make sure her traveling popularity doesn't become too much.The original Mean Girls film from 2004 is known as a classic, especially among people who also went to high school during this time. A remake after twenty years may seem a bit fast, but a lot has changed in these twenty years. For example, the way student life in high school functions has become very different due to the use of social media and smartphones. For example, participating in bullying is now more often done online. Over time, people have also started to view themselves differently and thus have a different identity or preference for relationships. They have placed these updates to the story appropriately in the film, without presenting it too exaggeratedly.Furthermore, it provides musical inspiration for many creative, appropriate singing and dancing scenes. In addition to their acting, the cast members also know how to provide good singing and dancing moments. Angourie Rice does a good job in the lead role. For Reneé Rapp, this is her first film acting job and she has worked more in the musical and music world before this film. Even though this is only her first acting job, she does a good and fitting job as the mean, popular girl from high school. All the musical aspects of the film sometimes take over the film, so that the character development can be somewhat lost. Connoisseurs of the original version can fill in this missing structure themselves, based on what they know from the original film. New viewers who are not familiar with the original may miss some information.This remake was written by Tina Fey, who wrote the screenplay for the original film. In addition to giving this remake a modern twist, she keeps the story close to the same story as her original. For connoisseurs of the original film, this remake may remain on the familiar side. This way, experts and fans can roughly compare what's happening. Tina Fey could also have adjusted the story a bit more to make this remake more her own.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","rebekahsislowski","18 January 2024","Renee Rapp is a perfect Regina George. I think it is very evident in this movie that seeing her do this musical on Broadway would have been even more amazing. Tina Fey was hilarious in this and of course loved the cameo. I wish that Renee Rapp sang literally every song because she did such a good job. Also, Janice was SO good and so fun that she was also Moana because I know she hasn't been in a ton since Moana and her singing is actually amazing. I didn't love the casting with Cady or Aaron Samuels but they weren't the worst choice. I do think it's hilarious though that they did not market this movie as a musical at alll. If you follow broadway shows then it's obvious that it was going to be a musical but otherwise you would never know lol.","

Now i did not know who Reneé was before this movie but i'm now indeed a fan to say the least.The movie was super refreshing and it gets me excited to see the new generations being hyped about this remake of a timeless classic.I really enjoyed the songs and they've been stuck in my head ever since i went and saw this movie.I understand it may not be everyone's cup off tea but i really do think everyone should at least go give it a shot! But do remember this is a musical remake, 20 years later after the first movie, so if you're going in expecting it to have the same early 2000's vibe, it's not.So dare i say it's better then the first one? Yes. Yes, i do.","

When Karen was singing Sexy at the halloween party she basically flaunts everything in your face.. but it was hilarious to me..Some songs I enjoyed, some songs I didn't.I went in with a clear mind, Didn't want to compare it to the original and was open-minded to it being a musical, and a whole new cast with new humour incorporated into the movie and I do think it was a great musical theatre adaptation of the movie.We laughed all the way through and it was fun and enjoyable to watch :)The storyline follows the original film, so its easy watching also :)Regina was our favourite character and she sings amazingly!

I understand this version is based on the broadway musical but what fits for stage does not translate to film. It's lost the charm.It races through the story and feels disjointed. Does not offer anything new. New cast are bland. There feels like there is no connection between the characters. There is no no depth or insights into the characters and story.Where I could watch the original over and over (again I know new version is based on the stage musical) this version will not become iconic.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","pbpetel","15 January 2024","""Mean Girls"" offers an amazing, talented cast and impressively composed songs, especially with standout performances from the likes of Renée Rapp and Auli'i. The film's refusal to put males in the spotlight is refreshing, yet it unfortunately receives an underwhelming 6.4/10 on IMDb. This feels unjust given the movie's overall quality. The storyline, characters, and humor make it a must-watch. It's a relief to see a film not solely focused on romantic pursuits, despite potential backlash from certain audiences. This discrepancy in ratings underscores the need for more balanced and insightful film criticism.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","andapan1","15 January 2024","This movie was better than I was expecting it to be. While remakes are often very poorly done and just straight cash grabs, I didn't feel that way about this one. I went in with low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.Now, that's not to say this a masterpiece of a movie, with some really deep meanings or anything like that. But it is a fun movie. Some of the songs were enjoyable and entertaining, albeit a bit silly. But that's part of what makes them fun! I enjoyed the choreographing, and the visual aesthetics created for a couple of the songs were (dare I say it) quite fetch. There were a few jokes here and there that didn't hit, but for the most part I thought that the humor was also well done.Go into this movie with an open mind, and I think you'll find out it's alright. It's not the original Mean Girls, but it's certainly not a disgrace to the franchise in my opinion. Sit back, relax, and just appreciate the entertainment from a good, solid movie.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","ymrhqtrz","13 January 2024","Having read up online that the new mean girls was set to be an adaptation of the broadway musical I had some doubts as I'm not the biggest fan of musicals. However, upon finishing the film without a doubt this film was one of the best musicals I have seen in recent memory. The film being a musical offers us more insight into the characters and why they opted to make the choices that they made. I know that probably won't make much of an impact with most of the people seeing this film. But being able to go deeper into a characters mind especially when it comes in the form of a musical is a wonderful thing for a person like myself who is autistic. Apart from the musical aspect of the film, the film offers us a refreshed and modern mean girls with just the right amount of sass. I sincerely hope that Renné Rapp is nominated next year for as many awards as possible she killed it in this film (from her acting, to comedic timing to her singing) she definitely deserves all of the praise that she is receiving and then some. The only down side I would say is that the film at times felt a little too clustered with all of the musical numbers and it took me a while to get into Karen's character (Avantika Vandanapu) but she eventually grew on me and her acting towards the later half of the film improved drastically. Anyone saying they don't see the need for the new film needs to wake up and smell the coffee, the film was adapted from the broadway musical if you like it then you like it and if you don't but don't leave mean reviews.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","nicolasroop","11 January 2024","There is a lot to love here. The music, the glamour and, of course, the drama of high school. However, it's missing some key ingredients that made the original the instant classic that it is. It is not as witty as it thinks it is and it's nearly lost all of the relatability of it's characters in it's high gloss presentation.Acting wise, the cast ate up every scene and performance. The musical numbers were pitch perfect. The standouts being Aulii Cravalho as Janis. Her voice was perfect for those scenes connecting the films plotline fairly seamlessly. Also, Reneé Rapp as Regina was brilliant casting. Her voice is amazing, particularly in the number at the halloween party. Just wow!As far as the plot goes, there are some jokes and plotlines that are missing. Perhaps due to the times, some of the jokes were not exactly ""pc"". I felt a couple were sorely missed, but it did not mar the production as a whole thankfully. There were some things the film tries to do from the original that kind of fell flat as well. It's like telling the same joke twice to the same audience, it just doesn't hit as hard the second time.Overall, I enjoyed it. It was a different version from the original, but just like The Color Purple, it's kind of meant to be. There are some cameos, including a very standout one towards the end that fans of the original will cheer at! If you're into it or a fan of the original, I say go see it. You won't be mad that you did.3.5 mean girls out of 5.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","vmarshmallow","12 January 2024","Very disappointed that this adaptation of the stage show used only half of the original songs, and shortened others that were kept on. A bit of fun, but a poor translation from stage to screen. Auli'i and Jaquel's dynamic duo carried the movie, and the cameos from '04 and Broadway made for some nice moments. I would, however, much rather go back to watching the original movie or a properly filmed Broadway performance of the Musical version (like Hamilton, but with a lot more pink).It was surprising that the people in my generation (Gen X-Y folks) were the only ones picking up on the cameos, easter eggs and comic moments, while the teen audience members (the target audience) were seen scrolling social media while the film played.This adaptation is a strong demonstration of why continuous reboots are not a good idea. Tina Fey has worked magic in creating the original film adaptation of this Queen Bee cautionary tale, and I hope there are young people out there who are as moved by this retelling as I was by the original book and the 2004 original feature.No more reboots though, please..","

"Mean Girls (2024)","descendants-12797","16 January 2024","I have seen the original film countless times and the stage adaptation twice. I have to say that in full honesty that this movie musical adaptation exceeded my expectations. I went in with low expectations because they shortened a lot of songs and cut out a bunch of songs as well. They replaced It Roars from the stage version with an original song called What Ifs, the melody and rhythm on several songs was changed severely. I was so nervous going in but when i actually saw the film i was extremely pleased with what was put together. The two best numbers in my opinion were Sexy and I'd Rather Be Me. Some songs were better in this film than on stage for example Stupid With Love. The entire cast was exceptional. And having the incredibly sexy Reneé Rapp playing the iconic role of Regina George was probably one of the greatest casting choices in cinema history. She brought the sex appeal and cruelty that Regina George is made of. The stuff they changed from the stage adaptation were necessary changes that were well done and extremely well placed. Also i think it was a very interesting take to make Janis actually a lesbian. As someone who identifies as part of the LGBTQIA+ community it was a very fresh take. It was also really nice to see a plus size gay Black man in the semi-leading role of Damian. Making Karen and Janis non-white was also a really interesting choice that i can really get behind. Especially because the two actresses were incredible in their roles.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","cowza","21 January 2024","So I'm an 80's child and amongst my peers are all those who starred in the OG Mean Girls. I'm naturally a massive fan but was sceptical how this remake would be for me as someone now in their 30s. When the critic reviews started appearing I expected to be utterly disappointed. Gotta say I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It felt faithful enough to the original to feel a comfort, yet new enough to give you plenty of fresh smirks. The music moved the story along so seamlessly, you'd be forgiven to think it had always been there. Casting was pretty solid for me with the exception of Cady, who did not necessarily give a poor performance, just lacked that likability Lindsay Lohan was so good at portraying. It left me rooting for Regina more but I wasn't mad about it. Some characters I actually enjoyed a lot more in this remake, particularly Damian, Janis and Karen. I'm sure Disney fans like me will also love and recognise the voice of Moana aka Auli'i Cravalho. I've liked it enough to now be considering seeing the stage show when it comes to London. Thank you for the escapism Tina Fey!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","masonsaul","23 January 2024","Mean Girls (the musical) is at its weakest when it's being a faithful remake since those moments are just the same but weaker. Whenever it becomes a musical or adds something new though, it becomes a really good remake that updates itself for the modern age and feels different enough to more than justify its existence.It's no easy task following up performances where everyone feels right and everyone here works to varying degrees of success. Angourie Rice always maintains Cady's likeable nature, Auli'i Cravalho & Jaquel Spivey are better than their counterparts and Avantika gets equally good laughs out of her role as Amanda Seyfried did beforehand.Reneé Rapp is absolutely phenomenal, making an iconic role completely her own just as she did on the stage. The confidence from that first musical number is unrivalled and every time she appears it reaches new highs. There's a serious argument to be made that she is actually the best Regina George.First time directors Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. Make sure the film feels cinematic with the shifting aspect ratios, extended takes and a very mobile camera. All of those techniques combined make it feel like cinema, confirming that it was the right choice to give it a big screen release opposed to the streaming debut it was originally intended for.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","vengeance20","20 January 2024","I was apprehensive of this film due to the previews showing that it looked too modernised & Gen Z like for my taste, but I went to see it anyways to see if it were any good!Cady Heron is a hit with the Plastics, an A-list girl clique at her new school! But everything changes when she makes the mistake of falling for Aaron Samuels, the ex-boyfriend of alpha Plastic Regina George!I found the film to be actually not bad! I mean, it had it flaws & fault no question, but, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was & was expecting it to be pretty bad! The actors do a great job despite the film having narrative issues & despite shoddy directing & editing it wasn't too bad of a watch!The films runtime is a bit lengthy, but not too bad at 1 hour & 44 minutes! The pacing isn't too bad, but again, like the runtime, wasn't without its flaws! There's some not bad tunes to be had & plenty of eye candy! So, the film can't be faulted entirely!Overall, it's not bad, but it's not amazing either, which is why I give it the rating I give it! I have yet to see the 2004 original & it's 2011 sequel, but I'm sure I'll find them better than this, though can't hate on this one either as it wasn't that bad & was surprising better than I initially thought!6/10.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","mclaum","12 January 2024","To be honest, I went into this movie with very low expectations. Due to the fact the first is an iconic classic with an extremely strong cast, and the fact it is a musical, but was not advertised as one. The little faith I had pre movie was that Tina Fey was involved and I had trust in Reneé Rapp. During the movie, however, I was shocked by how much I loved it. While Rapp did an outstanding job with the acting and vocals for Regina, the real standout was Janis actor, Aulii Cravalho, who voiced Moana in the Disney movie. Her acting was good, but what really was amazing was her vocals. The jokes were actually funny, and weren't reused from the original unless it was iconic. The only complaints I have was that while Cady did a great job acting, her singing wasn't anything special. The songs themselves were great for the most part, with a few standouts that I could have on repeat forever, although I haven't ever watched the musical itself, so I don't have a lot to compare the music to. I do think that Reneé Rapp will get a huge boost from this role.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","rgkarim","13 January 2024","LIKES:It Holds A Lot OF The Classic
-Fey's promises were true, the spirit of the blockbuster is present and accounted for in this version and holds much of the attitude of that Rom Com.-From those first moments in the garage and transitioning to the Savannah, you step back in time, but with a new face that starts to really engage the Mean Girl Spirit.-The drama, the backbone, the scheduling and the events are all there to relive with this new class, and for once doesn't feel too mocking, out of the way, or trying to watch.-It holds nostalgia, and that helps with appeasing part of the group coming into this movie, helping buffer things up quite nicely.Great Casting
-A solid direction for a new age, Mean Girls remake requires getting just the right people to play these iconic roles to not destroy the trust they might have built in the trailers.-For me, I think it was a solid job, most of the group head on matching the feel of their roles, their performances and the movement of the cast in what captures the spirit of the moment.-The personalities fit almost perfectly for me, the chemistry may be a bit more energetic, but still holds that ferocity of the moment, and yet is still so much fun to watch.-I applauded the casting director for finding this new blood and feel these risks they took were done well by the strong lineup presented.Fantastic Acting
-It may not be the most jaw dropping roles or performances, but my friends and I felt the acting for this remake again matched the caliber to some degree of this mixed up world.-Cravalho's edge is intoxicating, the genuine attitude and ire leaking out and standing up the world against the popular flow was inspiring, if not a tad over the top at moments.-Rapp as Reginia is a bit more Charlize Theron delivery. Conniving, acidic, and hypersexual tones will do things the original didn't, but nevertheless make that still fun and menacing villain that holds much to despise and plot against.-Rice as our protagonist may not have as much of the hard edge as Lohan did, but the transition is still strong, playing more to the innocent side for much of the film that I resonated too,. Sure, she needed a little more ice to match that engaging dynamic, but I didn't hate her substitution
-Favorite though goes to Jaquel Spivey, whose play of Damian was sort of the life of the party for me. He's got sass, humorous delivery, fantastic song prowess, logic, and fun all wrapped up in a big package, which helped to really blend everything together.Loved the Set Pieces
-Blending the two genres of musical and movie can sometimes get too lost in hybridizing, but again, Mean Girls 2024 accomplished much for me.-The shooting location is totally high school, and not sure if the same location or not, but had the feel of the American High School system.-When musical numbers come up, several of them had theatrical flair of a stage show, with confetti, costumes and choreography that just lit up a room.-It all came together in this hybridization that many times worked, and that added an engaging piece and to me, that makes a movie fun.Still That Humor
-The movie is stupid, don't get me wrong. We know the quotes, we know the mannerisms, and we know the sass run deep in this kind of thing.-In this iteration though, it finds a way to still make it fresh, appeasing the traditional, and helping really make me laugh at times especially from Damian who seemed the best mixing bowel for this group.-and despite never being the biggest fan, I still had a lot of fun with the movie's quotes and finding that sweet spot of laughter.Tina Fey
-She killed it the first time and she killed it the second, with Fey being the teacher that reaches out to save the day.-On the one hand, she pretty much plays the exact same character. Same lines, same angles, same mentoring, and same attitude that you know.-The other hand, grants a bit of newness with it, some new relationships and modes that the modern era allows that worked well, fit in time with the character, and overall adds some freshness to the role.-Add amazing confidence to the mix and acting quality that makes the teacher feel genuine and you get aces!Much Of the Music
-And the song numbers turn out to be a lot more fun than many of the recent musicals I've seen, really bypassing the one note wonders, and bringing attitude that the best shows for me have.-The opening number is just the tip of the diverse array of styles, all coming together to convey the emotions, but add different themes to enhance the showmanship and keep me invested.-Want a seductive introduction? They have that. A dark-comedical number with pop touches? We got that. Want to have an Avenue Q like medium about predators? They have that.-And the choreography itself sometimes very show tunes or music video vibe, and that adds fun, but sometimes really captures high quality.DISLIKES:Jon Hamm is a Waste
-He's got a few good jabs thrown in, but for the most part, Hamm's talents are not utilized in this movie.-I don't care how limited the role might be, he's got a lot of good in a role like this and reducing to tight shorts and a few dumb moments really didn't feel like the best casting.The Musical Interludes Come Out Weird In Movie
-Something that was a little too musical for me was the sudden interludes into the music for me.-I'm spoiled by Sound Of Music and Grease, two movies that found these top notch musical interludes to help balance song and acting.-But Mean Girls changes are blockier, somewhat forced, and feeling like just an excuse to plop a song into the mix. Sure, some of them are masked as internal thought (my favorites), but others were sort of just quickly jumping into the numbers and it was awkward for viewers like me, best left for the arenas of the stage.Some Of The Editing Seemed Off
-The movies feels a bit too hybridized together at times, and the editing seemed to force us into these unique moments that again felt odd.-In addition, the performances sometimes feel a bit too edited to the modern era to come off one note, the directions being monotone and missing that engagement that others did better, primarily the two plastics.-Throw in the potential scenes lost to make way for the show stopping productions and again you get something that sort of takes away from the movie and makes this confusing hybrid spread too thin in either direction to be completely whole.Pretty Much Verbatim Of The Movie
-I've never seen the show, but I've seen enough of the movie to remember a lot of the lines are pretty much exact.-While this pleases the nostalgic nerd in me, the originality factor takes a hit, and sort of dilutes the movie standing on its own.-And in the songs, it's clever, but at the same time sometimes forced, lines rapidly rapped or forced out in the song that sometimes didn't work for me.The Results:
Overall, I had fun with Mean Girls and really felt Fey accomplished much in this new mode to be fun and nostalgia mixed into one. The music really helps add energy and flair, giving it some fun and a soundtrack to start playing on Spotify, and making numbers that theater productions might not be able to match. A fantastic casting direction, and many fantastic matches to the roles, including Fey herself, further helps bridge the traditional and modern, with great writing to help to further enhance the experience. Add in good editing, a killer set, and all the energy coming together to be a fun time out at the theater. Yet, the hybrid also kind of hurts it at the same time. Editing cuts for characters like Hamm make their inclusion minimal, while also sort of robbing us of those key moments of dramatic clique chaos. Musical numbers, while good, sometimes come in at odd moments, that High School Musical approach that not only feels forced, but trips up the feel and editing of the movie. Some direction changes to make the plastics miss their dynamic calls, and perhaps not taking the chance to integrate some fresher lines further took away from the film.Overall, my scores are:
Comedy/Musical: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.","

Busy Philipps is a horrible actress and does not fit this role whatsoever. Choice of costumes were awful. Actors were awful. Songs were awful. Script was awful. Did not follow the original. Changes can work if done correctly, but in this movie they were not. Not even sure where they were going with this. They could have done so much better. Just do yourself a favor and pass.

"Mean Girls (2024)","meclote","26 February 2024","""Mean Girls (2024)"" presents a mixed bag of highs and lows in this musical adaptation of the beloved classic. On the positive side, the film boasts some standout musical numbers, particularly ""Someone Gets Hurt"" performed by Reneé Rapp at the Halloween party. This song is a clear highlight, showcasing the film's strengths in its musical elements. Additionally, Auli'i Cravalho's voice as Janice is a delight, bringing a Disney princess-like quality that adds significant value to the musical aspect of the film.However, the adaptation struggles with pacing and character development. Cady's transformation into a Plastique lacks the gradual progression seen in the original, resulting in a jarring and unconvincing shift. One moment she's in her usual baggy clothes, and suddenly she's donning mini skirts, leaving the audience struggling to keep up with her character's evolution.The film does attempt to tackle contemporary issues like the toxic use of social media among teenagers and the harmful practice of constantly comparing oneself to others. These points are well-made and resonate with today's audience. The underlying messages of supporting and backing up each other, avoiding gossip, and not judging others, especially during the formative teenage years, remain relevant and important.However, the movie stumbles in its attempt to adapt to modern sensibilities. In striving for political correctness, it loses some of the original film's charm and humor. Certain jokes and scenes that worked well in the original feel out of place or forced in this remake, detracting from the overall impact.In conclusion, while Mean Girls delivers on musical talent and addresses relevant social issues, it falls short in character development and fails to capture the essence that made the original film a cultural phenomenon. The movie feels like a vessel for its songs, somewhat hollow in its execution, and lacks the depth and wit that defined its predecessor.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Galop_Inferno","12 January 2024","For starters, I'm a longtime fan of the 2004 movie. It was a significant part of my preteen/teen years. Easily one of my all-time favorite films. The Broadway musical, which I got to see last year, I also love. If a movie I love can be expanded on by songs and I don't hate it, that's an accomplishment.I was brimming with hype as soon as I learned a movie musical was in the works. I saw it tonight... and I didn't love it. Now, it's not bad by means. I just felt deflated by the end of the first act. I knew the changes were coming, and I was ready. The new song ""What Ifs"" felt too much like a Disney musical opening song, in line with how underwhelmed I was with ""Welcome to Rosas"" in Wish.""Where Do You Belong"" could've been a perfect intro to the cafeteria scene. Jaquel Spivey and Auli'i Cravalho would definitely nail it. A lot of dialogue is nearly word for word of the original, and lack the bite they had 20 years ago. Reneé Rapp slays as Regina, easily the best performance. ""Meet the Plastics"" was so whittled down without Gretchen and Karen's verses. I also wasn't feeling any chemistry between Cady and Aaron. Angourie Rice seemed like she was just along for the ride (I loved her in The Nice Guys) and Christopher Briney is cute but he lacked the charm for me.Bebe Wood and Avantika's portrayals of Gretchen and Karen, granted their characters are Regina's lackeys, have some of that vibe. ""What's Wrong with Me"" felt what it should be but ""Sexy"" came out of nowhere, like they're ticking boxes for giving everyone a spotlight. Maybe it's the whole overt social media presence. ""Someone Gets Hurt"" is where my attention began to come back, and ""Revenge Party"", which is my favorite song, is an absolute delight.It seems that the most cut songs lies in the second half; as Damian's showstopping Act II opener ""Stop"" got the axe, Jaquel Spivey got Cady's verses on ""Apex Predator"". In the production I saw, the reprise of ""What's Wrong with Me"" swung right outta nowhere, and ""Fearless"" could've been this epic number after 'you can't sit with us!' With roughly 45 minutes remaining, the plot just forced ahead to Regina getting plowed by a bus and the Burn Book leak. ""World Burn"" is Regina peak, and it is glorious.Around the time ""I'd Rather Be Me"" comes on, there's a few neat tidbits that stand out, like Ms. Norbury and Mr. Duvall being in a relationship, one of the trust fall apologies being a girl apologizing to her friend for accusing her of dragging during one of the songs (and Ms. Norbury casually waving it off), and when Cady is recruited into the Mathletes, a brief exchange about 'making ""squills"" happen' comes right out of the stage show. ""Do This Thing"", performed during the competition, was cut, with a ""Stupid with Love"" reprise in its place. The Spring Fling scene puts a smile on my face, but ""I See Stars"" also falls victim to being shortened, and sung by another character (making for a nice brick joke).It's not perfect, nor is it bad. It's just fine. Honestly, I guess that's all I can really ask for. It could've been complete garbage. I'm glad it wasn't, and now my friends will be happy because I'm not harping on about it anymore. 7.5/10.","

This is the only movie I have ever walked out of because I became physically sick from watching it. It was that bad and I am not even exaggerating. The animation was a strange mix between live action and animation. It felt like I was watching the original movie while drunk. I hate whoever made this movie.","

What a fun and humorous movie to spread that message. Tina deserves all the props for expanding on this classic. High school is such a formative time and these movies always resonate. Go in with an open mind and a joyful spirit and it will not disapoint. Shouts to much of the original cast showing & supporting <3.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","ericgoldberg-50159","21 January 2024","This is a cautionary tale about what goes around, comes around. Cady Heron is a girl who lived in Kenya, Africa with her mother. She transferred to North Shore High School in the US and befriended two outcasts named Janice and Damian. The Plastics led by the queen bee of the school, Regina George, also befriended Cady and let her in their circle. Janice was bullied by Regina in the past and conspired with Cady to get revenge on the queen of mean. Cady suddenly became popular and her status turned her into a vain and petty person. She turned on Janice and Damian. Regina and Cady's karma came around to bite them. I saw the Broadway musical that this is based on and this movie does it justice. The cast performs their parts well. The moral of the story is basically don't try to be someone you're not and don't be mean or you'll be sorry in the end.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","r96sk","2 February 2024","Too similar to the original, though the musical moments do help alleviate that.I didn't necessarily like any of the songs performed in 2024's 'Mean Girls', but none of them grated on me - which is always a plus when it comes to musicals. I could've done with a slightly shorter run time, though the humour is decent - if a bit hit-and-miss.Angourie Rice is a bit meh in the lead role, certainly a downgrade on Lindsay Lohan. I guess most of the cast are inferior comparatively, but I did enjoy the performances of Reneé Rapp and Jaquel Spivey... Auli'i Cravalho too. Good to see Tina Fey and Tim Meadows back again, whilst there's a great cameo at one point.All things considered, it's fine. Can't wait for the 2044 remake.","

I was very skeptical about watching this because admittedly I am a purist and usually have issues with people ""tampering"" with movies I consider classics. This time however I put away whatever idea I had that the original can never be replaced and decided to enjoy this as it's own thing and more of an appreciation piece instead of a reboot. I can confidently say my expectations have been exceeded. I didn't know this was a musical and I gotta say turning this story into a musical is genius.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","TheJujuZoo","14 January 2024","For anyone who has never seen or heard the musical I'm sure they'd enjoy it. For any fans of the musical, you definitely won't.All of the songs felt very lackluster (except for I'd Rather Be Me). Cut the best songs in the musical, which totally altered the narrative and chemistry of characters.Cady's actress completely lacked the excited naivety of Cady which causes her to fall under Regina's spell. I also think the actress did not have the vocal ability for songs like It Roars and Apex Predator, which is why one was cut and the other was sung by Damien. And it's why Stupid with Love had to be majorly softened for her, instead of the excited jumpy song in the original. She would've been a great Cady if this were just a remake of the original, not a screen adaptation of the musical.A lot of the chemistry between the characters fell short for me. Gretchen was way too mild mannered, not the busy bee gossip she's supposed to be masking her insecurities. And in the end, her song about insecurities was pointless bc her relationship with Regina didn't come full circle. Karen's actress nailed her role and provided some comic relief but it fell short a lot. Cutting their part in Meet the Plastics was tragic. The original song is great and actually very funny. A lot of the cut songs would've nailed the comic relief the movie was desperately trying to fill with dialogue.The directive choice to sing and talk at the camera constantly like it's a phone was off putting to me. I understand they're going for a more ""modern social media"" style, but to me it just didn't land. It was borderline uncomfortable.I think the musical was about as perfect as a musical adaptation could've been, so it's sad they somehow mucked it up by changing almost everything and cutting the highlights for no reason. It wasn't a long movie there was plenty of time for some of the cut songs.I would rewatch it with friends but simply to make fun of it, but as a whole I did not enjoy it.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","benstack-79025","20 February 2024","Firstly this is just another cut n shut high school comedy. That's okay if the characters are funny - good actors, jokes and a quick fire script. The format is purely a platform which again is okay by me and we wouldn't have 80% of our favourite movies if this didn't happen.But this is a bloody musical. A very marmite thing when good and in a theatre. Musicals were around a long time befoer cinema, radio and TV and were the ultimate in entertainment when Gilbert and Sullivan were around.Of course they started to transfer to cinema and now streamers. They do not transfer well any more. The Zenith was probably Grease. It's been downhillever since but we still see them as pilots to convince investors of the big money needed to get tham in theatres. So viewers become an unwitting focus group that doesn't get paid.However if they do manage a long run on Broadway or the West End you're looking at serious money. A huge passive income from each theatre in the world that runs it for 5-10 years plus many other residuals. Hence the justifiable risk/reward.Tina Fey would like some Broadway money too as has every other writer/producer in the business. Her efforts are not good. Or maybe somone cut her in as the writer and it's their fault. This will not succeed. The songs are frothy, generica nd derivative with some harsh auto-tuning in the first 5 minutes.Sadly there are a couple of talented actors in this who will be tarnished with the proverbial brush.I wouldn't be surprised if Tina Fey herself is pretending this thing's never happened. Someone however has decided you can't polish a turd but you can roll it in cheap glitter.","

I appreciate that it's a different take, inspired by the Broadway musical, and penned by Tina Fey, just like the original. A direct remake wasn't necessary given the near-perfect nature of the original. However, this adaptation didn't quite hit the mark for me. The character dynamics lacked chemistry and their motivations felt unclear. On a positive note, I did enjoy the perspective shift to Damian and Janice. Performance-wise, Renee Rapp and Jeremy Spivey stood out with their impressive vocals. The film had its charming moments and a few new lines, but nothing truly stood out as memorable or iconic.Overall, it was an average experience for me.","

The songs were recognizable, a lot of the story was kept, and they came up with new ways to make the movie funnier.I think the music made the movie funnier it broke the tension, and allowed the audience to get into the heads of the characters.

Lot of young girls liked it and was popular. A smash hit film !We are now in 2024 a new take on the classic film Mean Girls. It's more modern, you have social media so that's more involved in the film of course it's going to be more cheesier and definitely more dramatised.Where to begin: The story is pretty much the same so is the characters the only difference is there is lot more music/ dancing but then it is a musical. And the fact that main girl comes from a different country.This new generation of Mean Girls was surprisingly good not a patch on the original but then they never are. I think they produced and directed this pretty well considering.It's more of a musical than comedy, there are some scenes that were funny. The acting is definitely over the top.Not so mean as the first film.The singing was pretty good so was the dancing the best thing about this movie was Damian Hubbard and Auli 'i Cravalho and the leading lady Angourie Rice. Now there were good stood out more and delivered a good performance throughout.Considering it was a remake I didn't mind it quite enjoyed it.If you are a teenager and never seen the first movie then you would probably love it.It's typical girlie film don't think men would like it lol.It kind of reminded me of Barbie just not as good.So if you are adult and like things like Barbie, and glee, Greatest days then you love it.If you have children/ teenagers and thinking about taking them or you are a teenager and like movies like High school musical, little mermaid,Matilda then I'm sure they will love it.Don't go in thinking thats it going to be as brilliant as the first mean girls cause it's not otherwise you will be disappointed.All I can say is watching this movie is what you would see in the theatre if I'm being honest.Don't go by the low rating or negative reviews cause they do get it wrong and so do people. Then it turns out that movie is actually good.Make a decision and watch it for yourself and then decide. It's good considering it's a remake.Sit back get comfy and enjoy.In cinema/ theatres right now.","

Musicals put to film always seem hard to pull off, and there are definitely some awkward moments that just don't translate well to film. But the cast was perfect. Renee Rapp was amazing.Once again though, I wish they would just film the actual stage performance. It seems this is what the majority of Broadway fans WANT so I'll never understand.","

Everything about this movie was just a bit worse than the original which is a cult classic. The fashion felt misplaced - at times looked 90s at times early 2000s - just confusing. Changing characters races or names for the sake of it (no other reason)... also no hate here but the original Regina is skinny so when she eats all of the candy bars there is a significant change in her physical appearance - that's the joke the bars make you put on weight. There was pretty much NO DIFFERENCE in Regina's physical appearance before and after she ate the bars, she looks the same. The plastics wear trainers/jeans/baggy trousers which is against the rules. The whole thing with Regina giving Cady the heels made no sense since unlike the original The Plastics didn't dress with skinny mini skirts and heels. Every character was a stereotype without the deep multilayered finesse of the original cast. Just a big fat meh! Don't waste your time and watch the original!","

The mix of the songs is very subdued and weak - when everything needed to go big.I really don't like most of the cast. Cady actress was hiring solely on her resemblance to Amy Adams who they couldn't get so they had to settle on Jenna Fischer. Busy Philips was an annoying cliche. I really wasn't feeling the Aaron or Damian people either. I guess the Plastics were passable. And Janice.

A musical (with said ""Professionals"") acting with a choreography, to boot!! Is this a music video? 🤔
Most concerning is its actually a paramount film?!?! WOW!! I've watched many independent, low budget film companies, and they produce far better then this by 100%
And I really don't, or even like leaving reviews, especially negative ones as I'm sure there was alot of work put into this...
Times though, one really shouldn't don't.At least for the sake of the QUALITY/LOVE of film!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","donmurray29","18 January 2024","Giving this an 7/10 ratingThere has been plenty of 'Mean Girls' films, and the musical, all which I have not seen, so this was all new too me. I must admit the disbelief at how stupid the characters all are, it seems that all schools in America are crazy???!! Also this film is very entertaining, we have yet another musical, 'Wonka' being the last, this is it's own thing.Tina Fey as writer and producer, Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. Direct a snappy film that goes in the right direction, great musical numbers with lots of colour and flair with craziness, with characters that do have some depth to them, even if most are shallow and idiots, which is what this is about. Everyone is good, I do mean everyone, not a single bad actor or performance, and it is funny, I just was not in the great mood due to the cold weather, but it was a near full house, just two empty seats in the screen, everyone laughing, it's fine entertainment.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","solerturbo","29 January 2024","Mean girls are not so mean anymore. More like unnecessary dumb. Is it a representation of the new generation? The film is just a mess. From the beginning, I was thinking of leaving the cinema.The most exciting moment was when Lindsay Lohan appeared, but her scene was a mess as well.Shame that to make a film now creators need to tick all the boxes instead of picking suitable characters.I think sometimes it's better to keep one version of the film and not create remakes. I like the original Mean Girls, the film was funny, exciting and entertaining. This one instead was boring, silly and ridiculous.","

I see people are upset that all of the original broadway songs were not included, but they don't understand how it needed to be adapted for a screen. The cast was amazing and absolutely slayed. They are so talented, and I'm glad the world gets to see that. The audience I attended with enjoyed the movie and laughed the whole time. The cameos from the original movie and broadway play made it ten times better. For people that didn't enjoy it, they simply do not have taste.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","jboothmillard","29 January 2024","Mean Girls was a good fun chick flick, it was turned into a Broadway stage musical by writer Tina Fey in 2017, and the year the original movie celebrated its twentieth anniversary, this song-and-dance remake was released, I decided I couldn't ignore it and to give it a chance. Basically, sixteen-year-old Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) has been home-schooled and living in Kenya since she was a child. She and her zoologist mother (Jenna Fischer) move back to America, and Cady starts attending North Shore High School. Being naïve, Cady has an intimidating first day, struggling to fit in during classes and around the school's various cliques. She befriends outsiders Janis Ian (Moana's Auli'i Cravalho), who is lesbian, and Damian Hubbard (introducing Jaquel Spivey), who is gay, who help her to settle in. They explain about the cliques, and warn her to avoid the Plastics, a group of crude, beautiful, popular girls. The Plastics consist of wealthy but insecure Gretchen Wieners (Bebe Wood), sweet but unintelligent Karen Smith (Avantika), and ""queen bee"" leader Regina George (Reneé Rapp). Cady is invited to sit with the Plastics at lunch, and Janis, wanting to have some fun, persuades her to infiltrate them to learn their darkest secrets. In her calculus class, Cady becomes attracted to senior student Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), who is Regina's ex-boyfriend. At Regina's house, Cady learns about the Burn Book, a scrapbook the Plastics fill with cruel rumours about the students and the teachers. Regina tells Cady that she and Janis were once friends until she accused Janis of being a lesbian and ostracised her. Cady is invited to a Halloween house party, but she misunderstands the dress code, dressing as a scary zombie bride while most girls dress promiscuous. Regina offers to talk to Aaron on Cady's behalf, but instead, she kisses him in front of her and resumes their relationship. Feeling betrayed, Cady fully commits to Janis's plan to ruin Regina's life, so that she will lose her boyfriend, her beauty, and her friends. Cady, Janis and Damian try to sabotage Regina's reputation, but their attempts backfire and only increase her popularity. Cady, Janis, and Damian plan to turn Gretchen against her. They make it look like Regina has sent candy canes to Cady and Karen while excluding Gretchen. Regina's reputation takes a big hit after a disastrous performance at the annual Winter Talent Show. Gretchen accidentally reveals to Cady some of Regina's embarrassing secrets, including that she has been cheating on Aaron with football player Shane Oman (Brian Altemus). Aaron eventually catches her and breaks up with her. Cady then targets Regina's body, tricking her into eating nutrition bars that cause weight gain and using face cream containing lard. Finally, Regina breaks a code of the Plastics, she is banished, with Cady replacing her as the new ""queen bee."" Janis invites Cady to her art show, but Cady lies that she is travelling with her mother on a business trip. While her mother is away on the trip, Cady throws a house party; she drunkenly tells Aaron that she has been deliberately failing maths tests so that he will speak to her. But he scolds her for becoming manipulative and image-obsessed, like Regina. Janis and Damian confront Cady for not inviting them and accuse her of becoming like Regina. Cady angrily accuses Janis of being obsessed with her, and Janis declares she has become a Plastic and calls her a ""mean girl"", renouncing their friendship. Regina discovers Cady's betrayal and gets revenge by distributing the pages of the Burn Book throughout the school. A riot breaks out in the school as the students and teachers read the nasty comments written about them, and Regina avoids suspicion by inserting insults about herself, placing the blame on Cady, Gretchen, and Karen. To restore order, Principal Duvall (Tim Meadows) and math teacher Ms. Norbury (30 Rock's Tina Fey, also writing) gather the female students in the gymnasium to admit their feelings towards and apologise to each other. Regina insults Janis's sexuality, and Janis retaliates by revealing her entire plan to destroy Regina's life with Cady's help. Regina storms out, pursued by an apologetic Cady, and she is hit by a school bus, and she is put into a neck brace. Cady realises the damage the Burn Book has done and takes full responsibility for it. Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn extra credit by joining the school Mathletes at the state finals. Overseen by the moderator (Lindsay Lohan), Cady answers the tiebreaker correctly and her team wins the championship. The team arrives at the Spring Fling dance, where Cady is shocked to be crowned the Prom Queen. She uses the opportunity to apologise to everybody she hurt, declaring that everyone is wonderful in their own way. She snaps the plastic tiara and distributes pieces of it to other girls in the crowd, including Janis, Gretchen, and Regina. Cady rekindles her friendship with Janis and Damian, reaches a truce with the Plastics, and makes up with Aaron, and they kiss. Also starring Jon Hamm as Coach Carr, Busy Philipps as Mrs. George, Mahi Alam as Kevin Ganatra, Connor Ratliff as Mr. Rapp, Ashley Park (Gretchen in the stage musical) as Madame Park, and Megan Thee Stallion as herself. Rice does a pretty good job as the lead character navigating her place in school, Rapp is well cast as the ultimate beautiful backstabbing cow, busty Avantika and ditsy Wood are alright support, Spivey steals the show as the loveable camp companion, and the returns of Meadows and Fey as the same characters, and Lohan's cameo, are genius. The chick flick about Barbie-like young girls and the American teenage school experience fused with song-and-dance numbers sort of works, there are some catchy songs, the ones that stood out were ""Apex Predator"", ""Sexy"", ""Someone Gets Hurt"", ""Revenge Party"", and ""I'd Rather Be Me"". It just about maintains the same ugly behaviour and spitefulness, the script has been updated with the times and attitudes of today's world, I admit I much prefer the original as it is funnier, but this twist is not a bad musical teen comedy. Worth watching!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","tlkkel","4 March 2024","It wasnt awful in the sense it had a decent script and idea, high school social politics and pressures. And that would have helped carry iot if it wasnt a carboard cutout of the original except with mostly cheesy musical numbers woven in. And not a few. A LOT of cheesy musical numbers. They took away far more than they added. They at times seemed to wanna make a point, but it never pased a moment to reflect on anything musical (the characters were oblivious to their own random belting out of showtunes) so if there was any message in any of the music, it usually got pushed aside when the dialogue resumed.It was mostly just the original repeated, but at higher speed with lower impact and a few mostly bad songs thrown on top..","

"Mean Girls (2024)","exceladeogun","21 February 2024","Mean girls (2024)This musical teen comedy is a modern musical reimagining of the 2004 film with the same title. Arriving two decades after the original, a lot of changes are obviously expected, and this remake embraces the changes of the times while paying homage to the beloved classic.Even with the changes at play here, this remake doesn't best the culturally impactful original or match it. The performances here are mostly standard but not memorable, watching this remake will make you appreciate the efforts of the original mean girls. The costumes aren't exciting. The jokes also lack punch either from their delivery or writing.The biggest difference between both versions is that this one is a musical. As a musical, not every musical number here lands successfully; the lyrics aren't impressive and some melodies are forgettable. Some of the songs are present just to remind audiences that this is a musical and don't necessarily move the story forward, though Renée Rapp's musical performances stand out as delightful highlights.Overall, this remake retains enough of the original movie's essence to make it worth watching, but the changes could have been more finely tuned to truly make it 'fetch'.5/10.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","stevencayer","20 January 2024","I can't believe MEAN GIRLS actually came out 20 years ago. I just remember how big of a pop culture moment it was back then. It had so many lines that people probably still use today, like it's ingrained in my generation. This generation is now getting a seat at the cafeteria table, MEAN GIRLS is back, this time based on the 2018 musical. For all you youngsters out there, this tells the story of a home-schooled teenage girl Cady (Angourie Rice) who moves from Kenya to dive head-first into the wild jungle that is high-school society. I have recently watched both versions now and here are the differences. The most obvious is that this version is a musical, full of songs that express the characters' feelings. To me, songs from musicals these days aren't very memorable, and this is no different. I've seen so many musicals just in the past month, maybe too many. My favorite one is still ACROSS THE UNIVERSE. Anyway, I'm glad Tina Fey went back in the writer's chair and revised some outdated phrases and racist stereotypes that were in the original. This is the first movie directed by the team of Samantha Jane and Arturo Perez Jr, and I believe they did the original justice. The cast is very good, especially the queen bee with a capital B Regina George, played by Reneé Rapp. She actually played her in the Broadway musical, and I can definitely see why. I also really enjoyed some cameos. The message still resonates; Try not to lose sight of who you are. We're all just figuring it out together. Overall, I had fun with this generation's MEAN GIRLS, even though it's a musical. Fetch is happening again. You go Glen Coco!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","southdavid","24 January 2024","I have seen ""Mean Girls"" before, but I think only once and, as a middle-aged man, it doesn't hold any special place in my heart. I did go and see this movie, of the musical, of the movie, of the book though and, whilst my expectations weren't particular high, I quite enjoyed it.Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) transfers to an American High School, having previously lived in Kenya with her mother. She makes friends with Janis (Auli'I Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey) and they introduce her to the cliques and social structure of the school, which is ruled over by ""the plastics"" and their fearsome alpha leader Regina George (Renee Rapp). When the plastics offer Cady a chance to sit with them, Janis and Damian encourage her to go and report back on what they're like.Regardless of the origins, I generally quite like musicals and the songs in this one are excellent; memorable, witty and funny. They service the story wonderfully and there's regular meta gags that play with the form really well. They're also really well performed and choreographed. The acting performances are great too, with all the of principles great and elevating the material even more. Tina Fey and Tim Meadows reprise their roles from the original film. There's a great cameo from Busy Phillips as Regina's mother and another cameo, that I shouldn't spoil, later in the film that drew gasps from the audience in the screening I was in.I should say about that screening, that there were lots of young girls in there - preteens dragged by parents that I imagine were fans of the original film and I didn't think that the film was particularly suitable for them. There's nothing too bad, but I'd suggest that the content stretches the 12A certificate right to the very limit.I should tell you that my cool, aloof, cynicism stopped me from enjoying this one but, as I've gotten older, I'm finding that side of things increasingly tiresome. Give me a good time, and ""Mean Girls"" certainly is that.","

Why have we not mentioned the fact that he's suddenly hanging out with celebrities that will forever be a level above him? Why the hell is he literally everywhere?!?!

"Mean Girls (2024)","ethanbresnett","21 January 2024","It's not unexpected that Mean Girls doesn't reach the heights of its non-musical predecessor, but it's still a decently entertaining film even if it does feel a little redundant.There's probably not much point dwelling on the story as, barring a few minor updates and slight alterations in some of the finer details, it is the same as the 2004 film. It's a fun story just like the original so enough said on this point really.The real difference is of course the addition of the musical element, which for me just didn't quite work. None of the songs hit the mark in my opinion. I actually thought they were all very well staged and well performed, but they just weren't great songs. A bit of shame but thankfully the film does have the good story to fall back on so this wasn't as bad as it might otherwise have been.One of the real highlights is the performances, particularly Renee Rapp who truly shines as Regina George. When the role was so memorably played by Rachel McAdams it's a hard pair of shoes to fill, but she does it so well and is truly magnetic on screen. Angourie Rice is a little less convincing as Cady but still strong enough, and the rest of the plastics are spot on.Overall I think this film is perfectly decent. There are some great performances and the story speaks for itself, with a few updates giving it a bit of a new flavour. It's just a shame that the songs let it down slightly.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","kjproulx","27 January 2024","The Mean Girls story is one that I quite enjoy, but the first film from 2004 is my only real exposure. I never read the novel that the original film is based on, I never saw the musical stage production based on the film, but I was still very curious about that stage production being adapted into a feature film. While this version doesn't hold a candle to the original film, I can safely say that I had a good time with the 2024 update and it can stand on its own. The musical aspect worked very well for me and I think the cast is great. I have my complaints, but this version still worked for me overall. Let's dive in.The story is the same as always. Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) moves to a new town and befriends a group of popular girls at school known as the ""Plastics."" Not everything is sunshine and rainbows though once their leader, Regina George (Reneé Rapp) finds out that Cady is interested in her ex-boyfriend Aaron (Christopher Briney). While she acts like these girls and constantly hangs out with them, her true friends are actually Janis 'lmi'ike (Auli'i Cravalho) and Damian Hubbard (Jaquel Spivey). They are the true heart and soul of this film and I think Cravalho steals the show as Janis on multiple occasions.As for the musical aspect, there are quite a few numbers and I can appreciate a good musical, so that doesn't bother me in the least, but I wouldn't exactly say the songs are super memorable. Yes, the way they are performed is fantastic, it's just that only about one or two stood out to me as great. Reneé Rapp is the only cast member to return to their character after performing on stage, and while she is a great performer musically, I did think there was something left to be desired in the smaller moments of the film. In fact, my favourite character in The Plastics was actually Karen (Avantika) this time around. I thought she played the bumbling dumb person hilarious well.The 2024 Mean Girls (aside from being a musical) also doesn't do too much for the story to separate itself from the original. All of the same story beats are hit and even some of the cast returns. It was great to see Tina Fey and Tim Meadows once again, but I feel that since the original film existed and then was already adapted into a stage musical, not much originality was present here. Still, I have to admit that I just like the overall story and this was a great cast, so I had a good time. Mean Girls is now playing in theatres and I recommend checking it out, especially if you like the original film and don't mind musicals.","

The end of the movie felt like it came really quickly which was a sign that I was having a really good time! I imagine it was helpful that I wasn't comparing it to the original or musical. The last time I saw the original movie was over 10 years ago, so I didn't remember much. I've listened to the musical soundtrack a couple of times, but not enough to know it well for comparison. That meant on its own the film stood up well. I had a fun time laughing and enjoying the music and staging.I thought all the actors/singers did a great job, (although kind of wished Angourie had belted a bit more.

Loved Renee's cool hip take on Regina, rest of the cast is great as well.People will never stop comparing this to the original which is to be expected, this is not a by the book remake of it or the Broadway show, neither a reboot, think of it more like a fresh reimagining of both updated for modern audiences.

This is simply a sad attempt to placate the youth so they don't have to go search for or look up anything while cramming the entire gambit of ""liberal diversity"" down everyone's throats.

"Mean Girls (2024)","jamkafka","25 February 2024","As someone who's grown up with the original film and someone who actually loves musicals, this one is not the best, but still quite enjoyable and entertaining. I have the original script memorized in my head so it was refreshing to see this one adapted a little differently and constructed to feel more modern. The delivery of the lines sometimes felt uncomfortable to watch that irks me (a little), perhaps a bit forced too just to fit the Gen-Z culture.What's lacking is the character development that most of it felt rushed even though the film felt so long to watch. Most of the musicals I have watched (Hairspray, for example) had always given character developments where the audience can further analyze on each character with the way they personality shifts in every act. This Mean Girls film did not represent that very well. I didn't see much bond from Regina and Cady so when Regina finally cut off that photo of theirs, it felt unnatural.Loved Auli'i Cravalho and Reneé Rapp's performances- I thought they were the best especially through their singing. Bebe Wood is an immediate favorite; her presence on-screen was natural.","

It also further perpetuates stereotypes that need to be permanently laid to rest, this movie was a waste of time and money, the lyrics were hard to understand for lack of enunciation it just sounded like a mix of overused riffs. Riffs back to back for a single phrase? Seriously? The acting wasn't bad. The choreography was repetitive and chaotic ... with the chaos it had the deceptive appearance of dynamic choreography, but it was just oversexualized garbage.","

When Cady is sent to spy on The Plastics by Janice and Damien, it sets off a series of chain reactions including drama, betrayal, and getting hit by a bus.Fans of both the original Mean Girls movie and the Mean Girls Broadway musical will not be disappointed. My favorite song was ""Someone Gets Hurt"" sung by Renee Rapp. From her gorgeous vocals and the beautiful scenery, this performance is so mesmerizing that it could have been a stand-alone music video. I love that they include other songs from the Broadway show like ""Apex Predator"" and ""Revenge Party"" as well as new ones. I also love the special cameo appearances and newly discovered facts about the original characters; both of which really add depth to the film. I love how the movie includes things like social media and other references to things unavailable in 2004. I watched this film in theaters and there were so many places where I just wanted to pause or rewind it because they were so mind blowing. This is a movie I would love to see again!The film's message is to be yourself and not get caught up with the wrong people. Cady was so fed up of ""living the life"" with The Plastics that she betrays her true friends and loses the smart and sweet girl she originally was. Parents should be aware that there is foul language as well as suggestive topics and special effects that are so realistic they will make you gasp.I give Mean Girls 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to18, plus adults. Be sure to watch after the credits for a very short post credits scene. Be sure to check out Mean Girls in theaters now! By Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","meeeshelly","25 February 2024","This AINT it. What is this musical nonsense?! I couldn't even finish it. Inaccurate and does not live up to the original. I turned it on and as soon as there was 3 songs within 3 minutes my boyfriend and I skipped through it to see how many songs there really were and it's legit a musical. Was anyone else aware of this? Or am I late to the party??? Regina looks like she's in her 30s and no one can replace Kevin G and Karen and Gretchen. We are so disappointed with this remake if I haven't made that clear yet. It's sad because we were looking forward to this movie. This movie is cringe to say the least.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","SnoopyStyle","24 February 2024","The 2004 movie turned into a Broadway musical turned into this movie. Tina Fey and Tim Meadows return in the same roles. Reneé Rapp is the new Regina George. Angourie Rice takes over from Lindsay Lohan.I really like the original and its great writing. This seems to be written for the TikTok generation and I feel old. More than that, I feel tired from watching it. My first thought is superficial. The 'kids' are in their late 20's. I'm fine with Reneé Rapp. Regina can be older and Rapp has a history with the musical. Angourie looks the youngest and she's in her early twenties. Worst of all, the background actors are looking professional. I get the need for Broadway dance veterans, but it doesn't look good on the screen.As for the songs, they are plot-based and very Broadway. There isn't a top 40 hit in the bunch. There are minor adjustments in the story. I'm fine with most of them. The bus actually works better in this one. The burn book outing is better. Janis goes into more detail in her situation and that makes Cady less appealing. The movie is like reworking a band's greatest hit. There is no need to follow the story since it's mostly like the original anyways. The original is a classic and this one is a loud singy copy.","

My friend and I went thinking it would be a nostalgic remake of the original, we obviously were not expecting an exact copy with new cast. The original was popular when we were in high school. But this was not advertised as a musical and it just didn't hold the punch as the original. It really seemed like they just recorded a musical and tried to pass it off as an actual movie, not that I have anything against musicals. This was all fluff and no substance, the major lack of an actual storyline. It was just a cut and paste spark notes musical version of the orginal Mean Girls with modern slang and themes added to make it more relevant to the new generation.","

She is the movie and the rest is the rest. The wardrobe didnt really pass the vibe off real movie but i got lost in her eyes so its ok. There are other actors that deserve some Credit as well, like the one that plays damian and the one that plays janis. Loved that they há more screen time and the writers used it very well. The other plastics also did a great job and the wardrobe for them was way better. My only reservations honestly were with cady and aaron. Didnt really liked that aaron in a fair comparaison with the one from the 2004 movie. The cady is boring in the first half of the movie and then she starts to became more interesting from there, but yet nothing like our lindsayRenee carry the movie but she had help and overall is very fun to watch.","

Some of the characters were tolerable but overall the movie was hard to get through. Regina was probably the worst one, maybe just because her songs were terrible and just didn't sound right. I wish they'd made some other kind of change as part of doing a remake, and maybe the idea of a musical version sounds good but it just felt like the songs were forced. Janis and Karen's characters were the best I think, especially Janis who I think had the best singing and acting in the whole movie. Other than that, I can't say anything positive about it.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","lisafordeay","17 February 2024","Mean Girls(2024)is a remake of the 2004 movie of the same name but with singing added to the mix.The story is pretty much like the original one but with a few minor changes.A transfer student named Cady Heron from Kenya (Angourie Rice replacing Lindsay Lohan in the original one) is attending high school where she befriends a group of popular girls called ""The Plastics,"" ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp replacing Rachel McAdams) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood replacing Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Avantika replacing Amanda Seyfried).However Cady ends up falling for Regina's ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney replacing Jonathan Bennett), which causes problems. As Cady sets to take down Regina with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli'i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself.Overall it wasn't a bad film. The songs come out of nowhere, they turned Regina from being two faced to being sultry,and there is alot of awkward closeups. Also features Tina Fey,Tim Meadows and a surprise cameo by Cady Heron herself Lindsay Lohan who all appeared in the original film.","

I thought it was quite good, well certain aspects anyway. A good lot of the songs were actually pretty good. The characters were all really likable and I think i burst out laughing a couple times.Regina George was super duper hot so that was a massive plus. Unfortunately, no hate to angourie rice, but a lot of her singing was really bad and really quite off putting, but reneè rapp was phenomenal. Also in my opinion the ending was a bit rushed and definitely could have been done better. 7.5/10.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","troy-boulton","22 January 2024","It's a reboot. It's a musical. Is it plastic fantastic? Maybe.It's 2024 and a new generation of it-girl plastics are ruling the roost. Except in the age of socials, rather than dominating the halls, it appears the queens of the moment have to satisfy themselves with being legends on their own screens. The musical aspects are a fun new (ish) direction, but it seems the recycling process takes the edge off our rehashed polymer pretties. Are gen zalpha soft? Have our PC sensibilities made our hard drives go floppy? Or has Tina Fey just lost the nerve to sharpen her claws in her sixth decade? Probably a bit of all the above. We live in different times, and this iteration of the plastic fantastic go heavy on the back-references and plays on in jokes, pulling their punches in preference of froth and uplift.The film is fun, and watchable to the end, but it is a different beast. This is most certainly not your mother's Mean Girls. And it clearly never intended to be. It's softer it's cuddlier. It's cuter. The monster teeth are definitely fake, and they're discarded almost as quickly as the book of burn.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Groverdox","29 February 2024","You know, I was just asking myself that eternal question: how do the people who make movie trailers have a better idea of the kind of movies people want to see, than the people who make the movies the trailers are from?I mean, the trailer for ""Madame Web"" was so good I almost watched the movie, but luckily I was warned against it.Nobody warned me about this ""Mean Girls"" remake though. And it's a classic example of a movie with a lying trailer. I mean, did you know this remake is a musical? I didn't. None of the previews showed a second of that.I see you, trailer-making people. You know what we want to see. You know most of us wouldn't have wasted our time if we knew we were going to have to sit through a movie in which at any moment the characters threaten to break into song.And of course, the songs all suck and are completely forgettable.Take away the songs, and what we're left with is a bloodless copy of the original movie, with actors left looking like they're holding the ball when the time to pass was five seconds ago. They look startled, like they don't know what they're doing there. At times, they intone classic lines from the original movie, but without any of the panache, and the words fall as flat as the song lyrics do.I feel bad for the actors. They were never going to be anything better than impostors. The movie seems to be doing well at the box office, so here's hoping it doesn't tank their careers, particularly Angourie Rice and Avantika.Tina Fey, on the other hand, should have known better.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","deleyshaun","6 February 2024","A musical that's worth it's salt has a seamless balance between a story and the musical items. This did not. It was a jarring, bumpy road. It was like it didn't know wether to appease people who wanted a straight remake or to do what it was supposed to- a film take on the broadway musical. The second sin committed was the musical items were no good and the actors weren't up to it. So what's left? Also the casting was pretty poor too. Another problem was it had less emphasis on the plastics - which is ok but it didn't work. Anyone knows what made the original strong was Regina George and the plastics. This may not be the best message but I'm not here to judge morality but film quality. On a positive- there were a few nice throwbacks to 2004 and I didn't mind the modern take on the jokes of the original. Overall a big dissapointment. Just sit home and rewatch the original. Just another reminder of how good it was.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","crossy1794","2 March 2024","Where do I start? The original is my favorite chick flick and I've seen it a million times as most girls have.My first problem with the movie, was the lyrics from the songs. I understand the movie is not that deep and doesn't need complex lyrics, but it was like they were written by edgy 13 year olds. My boyfriend caught two glimpses of the songs and asked me ""what the f are you watching?"".Secondly, the acting. Cady(Angourie) was kinda decent, but my biggest problem was Regina(Renee). Although she has an outstanding voice and her acting was quite ok, she didn't give original Regina vibes. I understand that this movie is supposed to be something new but let's be honest. It's a remake. All the actors tried to copy the previous actors from the original. Renee failed dramatically for me. Rachel McAdams in the original was perfect because she was a total mean girl but still charmed everyone because she could fake being so sweet and innocent. Renee was just mean and a total b**** to everyone. In real life nobody would worship her. She was hysterical all the time. I just wanted to slap her. Janis was decent with an amazing voice, Damian really funny but Karen(Avantika)? A big no! The worst of them all! I feel like somebody told Avantika to copy Amanda Seyfried if she had a lobotomy. Such bad acting. Amanda Seyfried in the original was perfect! Her acting was so good, that made you think she was actually dumb. Avantika seemed like she wanted to look dumb to people and just acted cringy all the time. Her only characteristic was that she has slept with a lot of people. Nice addition guys. Gretchen honestly was similar to the original one.Third and last, the screenplay. They tried to fit all the songs in the movie, so they cut many important (to me) details. They cut phrases in half so the movie lost a lot of its meaning and essence. Also they merged scenes or left some off completely. The actors were speaking sometimes fast, so the scene would be smaller with no emotion.They shouldn't have done that. If they wanted something original, they should have made a new mean girls movie, like they tried in mean girls 2 but of course with better screenwriting and better actors. I didn't have big hopes for this one and unfortunately I was right.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","hncddhtxw","14 January 2024","I'll start by saying, this is not a ""remake"" remake. At least, I didn't take it to be. It is MEAN GIRLS 2004 at its core, simply updated in ways that ""slap"", as the kids who will flock to it most might say.There are clear differences between the original and this update- namely the musical aspect, which is a very YMMV situation. As a person who often doesn't like the 'cheese' of musicals, I'll admit that this one was a pleasure to sit through, even if the songwriters missed the mark by making Cady sing about not being good at ""love"". The song would have been broadly more relatable to showcase her awkward interactions in class with Aaron about not being good at ""life"". Cady had trouble navigating American High School culture and the friendships there as much, if not more, than her love life- so this felt like a mark missed, for a movie where the main course is rooted in self-acceptance via figuring out what it means to be a good friend and force for good, with a side of crush content.But more notably, there are other important aspects that make it just a conscientious update to the 2004 film. To just mention two, and not give the film away:Firstly, it's an update for the heightened inclusion that is woven effortlessly throughout the script, which was merely more than a hint in the original due to coming about at a time when our society only had one state (Massachusetts) that recognized gay marriage in 2004, and still fights for women to be valued as more than being receptacles for pleasure or hosts for reproduction. The 2004 film brought gay characters onto the horizon in what was a palatable-for-the-time way to family audiences, when gay characters represented on screen in works geared toward teens and pre-teens and their families was still several years from commonplace. There is no shade to be cast on the actors in he 2004 film for this; it is matter-of-fact for the time, and the actors back then did an amazing job bringing to life what it was to experience high school when many kids still didn't know what ""gay"" meant. In two words: Representation matters. The update brings these integral characters in the film out in front of audiences- proudly- and is made better for it. Our 2004 Janis and Damien were every bit the Janis and Damien we needed and wanted, and they ran so our 2024 Janis and Damien could run.Second, there are updates to the language used in the film that honors how far we've come as a society in two decades, even if we do have some distance yet to go. In one instance, rather than Regina George writing of herself in the Burn Book that she is a ""Fugly Sl*t"", she uses another word to replace the one previously reserved for weaponizing against women to make them ashamed of their sexuality. And in a similar acknowledgment that words matter for the way people might be perceived through descriptions, Principal Duvall doesn't state with frustration when the girls go wild that, ""... I did NOT leave the south side for THIS!"". This line to reflect his frustration changes to correct one that, in 2004, was at the time, unknowingly- if not at least unintentionally- steeped in classist, racist ideas that shame people for being born into a race, place, or circumstance that they have no power to influence. When you know better, you're *supposed* to do better- and this was a much-needed update to the script that, while noted, didn't seem out of place (they gave it a very applicable update, which educators or anyone who's underpaid in employment can relate), or make you miss the original.My rating reflects that I think this update would have stood stronger if it had not been done in a stage-to-screen musical, and utilized the scene breaks spent singing to build a little more on some of the supporting characters. For example, we learn in the update more about Gretchen's ethnic background, which could have been more interesting woven into as a conversation between Cady and Gretchen... just mentioning it briefly without any further discussion at all in the film felt like the film trying to ensure something that, without follow up, it just does not.This film stands separate and apart from the original made in 2004. I have a hard time thinking ""remake"" about it, because while it obviously follows the same script it definitely serves up some pertinent improvements that reflect how social norms change- and prove that change is Ok to embrace, even when (or maybe especially when) we think that we don't need it.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","dollywinkster","21 February 2024","I'm going to keep it as short and simple as I can. I already knew that this movie was going to be a musical and I am open minded to new takes. They took a very interesting direction to take an original movie and remake it in a way that is modern to todays teenage society especially with the whole social media being the most important platform in today's society.I love love love Renee as Regina she really captures a true mean girl reminds me of Regina from the 2004 version. Damon and Janis really portrayed their characters very well. Majority of the cast were pretty good at acting but I feel Cady was a bit lacklustre in her character. I feel that Karen's character was also disappointing.As for the whole direction of the movie and flow it's pretty much adding the iconic lines and changing it in the way that 35mins in we already have 3 or 4 scenes worth of those iconic lines that was used in the original in one scene. They reworked the writing and scenes but still kept the original style which is not bad. They did make some silly random comments which made no sense and wasn't really funny. But everyone's humour is different. :)If we talk about the musical side to it. Cady's singing parts were a bit unnecessary and felt a bit awkward. There was one scene I liked which is to do with Regina walking outside of the school. Janis and Damon singing throughout was really good. Karen's Tiktok number when they are getting ready for Halloween was actually catchy. Every single song that Regina sang was amazing. She is the true star of the movie.Overall, this movie is actually not bad as people are making it out to be. Yes, a lot of people think its pointless doing a remake of an iconic classic movie and making it a musical but the direction of how this movie was directed was actually done well.Would I recommend it?Yes if you like musicals and loved the original classic you would actually enjoy this movie.Would I say it's just as good as the original?You can never ever beat an original. Let alone it was written by the same writer as the original version. So I am sure Tina Fey knows her own movie very very well to make a musical out of it instead of recreating a garbage Mean Girls 2.0.","

I'm not familiar with the Broadway show so maybe this was for fans of that. To me, it was too much. The song and dance routines were too overstimulating. Too much going on with the background dancers. It seemed like there were just too many especially most of the songs done at the school. If they had cut that down to about half the teenagers I think that would've been better.I can see how this would translate better on the stage instead of the screen. I saw it with other Gen X ladies and we had some laughs. We all noticed the ""Plastics"" were built nothing like real teenage girls lol.I was pleased to see the cameo of Lindsey Lohan.

"Mean Girls (2024)","irisirenie","30 January 2024","I went into this movie know it was not a remake, it was different, and knowing it was a musical. I have heard all good things from friends who have seen it, but I didn't like it. The acting was all over the top and cringey. The main characters (Cady, Janis, Damien, Regina, Gretchen and Karen) were all more talented at singing that they were at acting. Many of the songs were not necessary, didn't enhance the plot, and came out of nowhere. I didn't like the actress who played Regina (Renee Rapp) and I feel as though her take on the character was not right for the film. The actresses who played Karen (Avantika) and Gretchen (Bebe Wood) were both good but overshadowed by Regina (in regards to screen time and storyline) a lot more than they should have been, likely because Rapp is very popular among my generation (Generation Z). She was a lot taller than the other characters (due to height and high heels), which I think was to show she is basically in charge, but it didn't really work, it felt messy. Angourie Rice played Cady Heron in a sort of way that didn't really make sense in the story, as well as the fact it was done in a cringey way. Auli'i Cravalho and Jaquel Spivey were very good together as Janis and Damien. The returning actors of Tina Fey and Tim Meadows were highlights, and it was great to see a cameo from Lindsay Lohan.","

As soon as the movie stated I hated it, I wanted to walk about and wondered why I even thought it would be a good idea to watch this, considering the original is so iconic. Then after about 15 mins into the movie it clicked, this movie is just a harmless musical version - but on film. When I go to the theatre and watch a play or a musical that is based on a hit movie then it's usually an enjoyable experience being reminded of favourite scenes of the movie and sassy one-liners that were all supposed to laugh at together. That's all this movie was, its not trying to replace or upgrade the original. After I thought about that 10-15 mins into my viewing, I actually enjoyed it a lot more. And the actress playing Regina George SMASHED it, she was a great choice of casting!","

"Mean Girls (2024)","akoaytao1234","21 February 2024","PREFACE: Have not watched the original musical though have some memory of the original FILM.Its fine. I have a lot of issues with the writing in this one. The pivot towards Damian and Janis as the narrator over Cady really removed a lot of the reason the original film is very remembered. Its that a mean girl takes another mean girl to make one AND even those below the pyramid are equally ready to be mean to get a rise. It kinda tries to absolve Janis from the shenanigan and fault Cady for her want to be a plastic. This change in narration, doubles down on the already on nose message of the film. Its a subtlety nightmare. The music too is not that memorable.Acting wise, everyone can't act, though half of the fault here is the writing which tries hard to make a point that they make callbacks to the original. The other half is the actors just shockingly being forgettable. You kinda appreciate the original actors since they are natural scene stealers AND they pop off. Only Avantika and Auli'i Cravalho have that quality on them. Avantika just glistens when she's on screen - even with her wonky timing AND while I have issue with how they handled Auli'i's character, she shines when given a chance to sing her hearts out. Everyone here fades in the background, and shockingly even the much hyped Renee Rapp (who felt very uncomfortable for much of the watch).Overall, I think I am a bit more critical that average but I think its a good enough supplement if you are a huge fan of the original (I did not care for it even then) . Though this is totally unnecessary and lesser musical re-imagining.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","bm230199","5 February 2024","As a big fan of the original I was excited for any more mean girls content and was one of the few fans happy when they announced this would be a film of the musical version. I thought it was a film that could easily be transformed into a musical and I was right. The songs fit in well and mesh with the story very well. It also helps that pretty much the whole cast are amazing singers and with power-house vocals like Reneé Rapp and Auli'i Cravalho the songs really shone and were enjoyable. Speaking of I found Rapp and Cravalho were the standouts of the movie with them dominating every scene they were in. Rapp in particular was amazing and I can't wait to see more of her in the future. I hadn't heard of her before this film and am now a very enthusiastic fan. I did think Cady and Aaron fell a little flat but to be fair compared to all the other characters they are the most boring so I think that was inevitable. Overall a fun adaptation that is of course not as good as the original but offers fun songs, an incredible Regina and a more progressive take.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","BCPro","21 February 2024","After seeing multiple clips off TikTok on how comically bad this was I decided to watch because of Renee Rapp and how talented her voice is. Had no idea who she was but I liked her look and voice. This movie was actually pretty good and I enjoyed it. You could notice they rewrote in relationships and made it more LGBTQ friendly which is something they rarely did in the early 2000s when the original was made. I liked how modern things were and how it was less dramatic and ""white girl"" drama like the original. There were references to different cultures and a diverse cast. I'm sure there will be people upset about that since it affects the stereotypes the original had with OG plastics. I liked the little costume references to euphoria and the set design. My two biggest issues I had with this movie was it was too focused on Janice and Damien. I believe it was supposed to be but at one point I think they had more songs than the plastics. The other issue was the casting of Cady. She could not sing very well and had zero expression or energy when she became the new ""it"" girl. I think she needed more training but I did like parts of her character. Overall it was a fun movie that will probably be put on Netflix in the next year or two. I definitely would rewatch and I'm sure in another 10-20 yrs there will be a reboot.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","emilymaywoodward","19 January 2024","Wish they put their own spin on it instead of recycling the same jokes and changed the music to be 'less offensive' I guess. However when I didn't hear 'Janice is a space duke' I was very upset (from a member of lgbtqia+ community).Renee Rapp and Auli'l Cravalho were absolute perfection in this movie and were the only 2 cast members to bring something different to the role. They had so much fun with it and you can tell that they didn't need a lot of direction as this comes naturally. The reactions from cast and crew felt like a GCSE drama piece but the dancing was fantastic. I'm a massive theatre fan but this was the only movie musical I found myself begging them to stop singing (apart from Renee and Auli'l)I don't know where Angourie Rice was pulling that Cady Herron from but what a snoozefest, I found her flat, boring and just uninteresting to watch. Would be interesting to see what someone else would have don't with the role.I wouldn't watch again.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","novagirl11","5 February 2024","After seeing both the original film and the Broadway musical, it had a lot to live up to. I appreciated that they slowed down the tempo of a couple songs because it made it easier to hear and understand the words. I enjoyed the cameos and star-studded cast, even those who were not in it for very long. I was definitely laughing out loud and I love that there were new jokes along with the traditional ones! The choreography and dancing were awesome. There was obviously a lot cut out from the musical, for obvious reasons, but I think the movie could have benefitted from being just a little longer. Plus, it felt too diluted and blatantly censored in ways that could have otherwise better developed the characters and plot. But, overall it was still better than expected.","

It was boring to watch the same story line but with bad music. You could have brought back the old characters but as parents instead of us reliving the same drama but with a cast that couldn't live up to the old one. When you do a remake, make it better. It also seemed to push the boundaries of the PG13 rating. There was a lot of hints of sexual subjects and it would have been more fun had the focus been directed towards the meanness rather than exploiting the boobs of teenagers. Overall, disappointing, and not a fun family movie.","

The girl playing Karen was not the right fit. A few bits were funny but it's ways to early to create a new version of a film that is already still good. Love Tina Fay but I think they found the wrong actors. They took out old jokes that were so funny. Over acting and just not as fun as the original film. The songs were to cheese and the actors who played Janice and and Damian were just not as good as the original. I still think the biggest let down was Renee who played Regina. She was just awful.","

No one breaks out into singing or dancing in real life so there's no way to make it feel natural. The dancing may seem strange but that's literally the whole point and if your don't like it and it ruins the movie for you then that means the movies not for you.Highlights:
the cast was great. No complaints. Everyone killed itthe script. I felt had a nice balance of being modren and using/ making fun of gen z slang and culture without being too overt or annoyingComplaints:
the whole fat shaming plot is not enjoyable but I won't critic this film for that as it's a product of the script from the original movieThere was one moment where Catie holds the camera strangely and its off-putting, and there are other wierd little scenes like that but overall I really feel like those bits add to the character of the movie. This is a movie that I want to be able to make of and laugh at with my friends well also being genuinely entertaining and the movie excellently succeeded at doing that.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","matthewreinink","10 March 2024","As far as remakes go this one is pretty bad. The musical aspect just does not work on any level. The songs are horrible and a drag to sit through. You can't make a musical with songs this bland and boring. Although a lot of the cast is relatively unknown, I do believe they do a good job at mimicking the characters from the original. Cady, Regina, Karen, Gretchen, Janis, and Damian are all well acted in my opinion. I actually don't have many problems with this movie outside of the awful songs. But they really ruin it.The more I thought about it the more I respect this movie despite how bad it is. In a world where soulless cash grab remakes are 50% of Hollywood's output, this movie is much more bold than those other films. You have to give it credit, they tried something outside the box when they could have filled theaters with a scene for scene remake.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","duckykels","3 February 2024","This movie was just not needed. The original mean girls is still so iconic and popular, that a newer and musical version has too high standards to meet! Standards that it didn't meet. Whilst there were funny moments and it was an easy film to watch, the script was pretty much reused. They delivered the same iconic lines that the film is known for, in a more cringe and predictable way. However, I think that Renee Rapp did an amazing job at her role as Regina George. Her singing and musical numbers have had the most attention online and she does portray Regina very well. Overall, I think this movie is worth seeing only to laugh and cringe with your friends in theatres. If you are looking for a genuinely good two hours of cinema, then maybe steer clear of this one.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","joavabra","13 January 2024","I came into this movie as a Mean Girls connoisseur. I've been in love with the original movie since middle school, saw the Broadway show on tour, and was in the show at a local theatre this summer. I'm going to start with the most divisive part: the music. In short, it was bad. Not to say the music in the show is anything spectacular, but it's catchy and fits the overall campy tone of the show. In the movie, a majority of the songs were toned down in order to appeal to a more general audience. This really weakened the film. The biggest example of this was Stupid With Love. On stage, it's played as an upbeat, comedic number. But here, it almost takes itself too seriously. It would've had the same effect if they played a Billie Eilish song over the scene of Cady obsessing over Aaron. The only time the music truly worked in the film was when it was almost identical to the stage versions, in songs like Sexy, Someone Gets Hurt, and World Burn. They were fun and showcased Renee and Avantika's voices nicely, almost too nicely as Angourie's meek and lazy voice sounded weak in comparison. Deciding to cast actors who have never sung next to broadway alum was certainly a choice. Other than the music, the script was almost identical to that of the stage show. We've all known that Renee can play this part and play it well, and everything she did is what I've seen on slime tutorials on youtube so no notes there. Avantika as Karen and Jaquel Spivey as Damian were the standouts of the main cast. They both did something new with their characters and made me laugh out loud more than anyone else in the film. I see this as a breakout role for the both of them. Nevertheless, all of the leads held their own and most issues with the film were with production and story. As a fan of the musical and original movie, I would say this is my least favorite of the three. But it does hold its own and I hope it does it's job at introducing wider audiences to modern musical theatre.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","davemavericks","3 February 2024","Let me start off by saying I knew this was going to be a musical adaptation. With that being said let's get to this review....
The movie served its purpose and required no thinking and was just a fun time all throughout. Most of the songs drive the story especially the scene where Gretchen (Bebe woods) sung her song what's wrong with me? Brought me to tears, when she looked at the music box and regina (Renee Rapp) yelled at her to return. She then proceeds to play the music box one last time and finish her song. Her character does stand out as one of the stronger characters. It would have. Got a higher rating if she got more screen time.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","TomTalksFilms","22 January 2024","2024 marks 20 years since the original Mean Girls hit cinemas and touched the hearts of teenagers everywhere. I unfortunately would have been 4 at the time and only got around to watching the original film in the last couple of years. Watching the film as someone in their early 20's meant it didn't hit the same spot that it clearly did for teens in the early 2000's but I can definitely appreciate why it was so successful.The big difference between the original film and the new film is that the new film is a musical I believe based on the stage musical of the same name. Also written by Tina Fey, it's again a story of finding yourself and your place amongst your peers during the high school/secondary school years.Firstly being that it's a musical it seems appropriate to start by discussing the music. I personally am a big fan of musicals in general I do however think their is a lot of competition in the musicals set within high school sub genre. My personal favourites are the likes of Heathers and Dear Evan Hansen. Mean girls didn't come close to those for me however it certainly wasn't bad. A couple of songs 'Stupid with love' and 'I'd rather be me' stuck out most on a first watch/listen and I'll be interested to see whether I gain a liking for any of the other songs after more listens.The comedy is pretty much exactly the sort of humour you would expect if you know anything about Mean Girls or high school films. As someone in my 20's this is where the film faltered most for me, I definitely smirked a couple of times but there were no big laughs for me. The film is also very post modern/self aware so if you like that kind of humour or are a fan of the original film I'm sure you'll enjoy those references.Overall it was an enjoyable near 2 hours on first watch/listen but isn't one I'm going to be going back to time and time again like I do with the likes of Heathers etc...","

"Mean Girls (2024)","keegankennedy-73366","14 January 2024","This movie is about as mediocre as it gets. I love the original Mean Girls (2004), and the musical is fun though not a masterpiece. But this remake was largely bland and devoid of personality outside of a few characters - specifically Damion, Karen, and Gretchen.The musical arrangement bothered me and didn't work to advance the story for most of the songs. Whether this was because Rice (Cady) isn't vocally strong enough to play such a vocally demanding part in a musical or they were going for a different style...it just felt consistently flat. Regina (Rapp) has a great voice which salvaged some of the musical storytelling, didn't love her acting and she won't be winning any awards for this role, but she carried the movie musically.My biggest issue with the movie was that compared to the original and the musical, it wasn't funny. Was it fun? Sure, at points. Did I have a bad time? Not at all (aside from cutting 'It Roars' which is my favorite song from the musical). I understand that a lot of the jokes in the original might be too extreme or insensitive, but if this is supposed to be a comedy it certainly didn't make me, or seemingly anyone in the movie theatre I was in, laugh. Seeing it once was more than enough for me.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","UnderTheScene","28 January 2024","Talk about a disappointment. For a film based off a broadway show, it should've stayed on the stage. From acting not being great, to majority of the musical numbers not hitting this was a painful 1 hour and 52 minutes. A lot of the time it felt like I was watching music videos more than a film, which threw me off. A few pros that come from this version of Mean Girls was Damian(Jaquel Spivey) who was great in this and Reneé Rapp playing a decent Regina George, but no where near as good as Rachel McAdams. Honestly Jon Hamm should've been utilized more, as he was the best addition to the cast by far. At least they kept the classic lines from the original film.Overall this was a disappointing reboot/remake and the few good points could not save this from a low rating sadly.","

So me and my daughter changed to see Mean Girls and ... meh. I wasn't really impressed. I don't know if it's cause I'm older now or what but teen comedy movies just don't hit as hard as they used to. Yes, that makes since!This movie could've been much funnier. The acting was ok. The direction was ... only satisfactory. I grew up watching She's All That, Not Another Teen Movie, and any Jennifer Love Hewitt teen movie cause she was hot. THOSE were well casted, acted, directed, and written.This one just isn't that memorable, and here's why:1. The lead actress is no Lindsay Lohan. I was in HS when the first Mean Girls came out and I though Lindsay was smoking hot. Hey, I'm Black and from Los Angeles so I didn't grow up around White girls. She was pretty and had nice ... body parts. She acted well, as well, and had a gravitas. This lead actress, she did ok, but ... it wasn't the same.2. The comedic bits weren't all there. The first Mean Girls had tons of comedy. Here, I think I laughed out loud one time (I forgot the joke) and there were other funny moments but not as much as the original. Comedies are supposed to be FUNNY.3. I'm too tired to keep writing lol sorry.","

Musicals and movies when combined often don't ring the magic they entail on their own. Yet here we have Mean Girls: The Musical which is filled with magic through and through.From start to finish I was grooving along to familiar broadway tunes given an edgy pop twist and loudly laughing to many a joke both familiar and new. What made the rendition so brilliant was a clear mark to be its own unique movie not exactly like the first, particularly through its current day setting; an age rife with technology and social media not seen 20 years ago.This is a must see for Mean Girl fans and newbies alike, as all will be left smiling from ear to ear with a piece of plastic tiara in hand.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","adamlovecopy","14 January 2024","Wow. I wasn't expecting much, but this was so horrible and so unnecessary. The girl who plays Cady should've never been cast, she sings flatter than the mom in Stepbrothers during her Range Rover solo of ""Sweet Child O'Mine."" And it's literally the same script, but shorter, with interjected and forgettable songs. Even Tina Fey seems checked out as Norbury and it's her damn movie. The guy who plays Damian is a convincing copy, but derivative nonetheless. The only saving grace (somewhat) is Renee Rapp's belting pipes and her sharper, more shrew approach to Regina George: she's absolutely fabulous and sets a high water mark. The same can be said for whoever plays her mom: it's almost inconceivable to play a character Amy P slayed and make it your own, but she does seamlessly. Unfortunately, neither are in the movie long enough to make up for the rest of the flat, uninspired performances (Janice, Karen, and Gretchen are all so flat, over-the-top, and simultaneously unfunny). The one new laugh comes from Kevin G. Delivering the only well-timed (and new) line of dialogue at the end. Yikes. Save yourself the money and time. Two hours has gone by faster for me getting my teeth drilled. This thing was so poorly-written and acted and so superfluous, I questioned whether or not it was commissioned by the Eric Cartman version of Kathleen Kennedy.","

The mean girls characters aren't likable and they look older. The new Regina George has nothing on Rachel McAdams. It's like she was out of place. And the singing.

But when you rewatch the original you'll see just how many jokes and plot points are copied.

It's still a good script but it's the same bs we get for live-action Disney remakes.With that being said, the songs were actually some of the best parts of the movie. I mean most of the songs themselves weren't anything too special but visually and the choreography were so fun with great visual comedy. I will also admit that I found some aspects a bit more enjoyable like some jokes were just funnier and the over the top satire was also solid.Also a nitpick but why literally say what the message of the movie is at the very end. We just watched the full 1 hour and 45 minute movie how dumb do they think the audience is that they have to sum up the entire meaning of the film??So I guess I still ""like"" this movie to an extent but oof it's just the original with a different cast, songs, modern use of social media and a stronger sense of self awareness.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","vevespears","10 March 2024","No spoilers general ideaWhy the exact script? Minor changes, and added as musical? Just because High School Musical was a hit doesn't mean all teen movies should be musical... plus the cast... come on!!They don't even look any close to teenagers!! These women super beautiful but they definitely look grown up women not teenagers! They are too old to play teen characters. Probably they can play college students not high school studentsWould have been better like a sequel, like how the original mean girls children doing with the modern of social media, like a burn book in social media account or website or some sort.Anyways... nice try on ""trying"" but HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT imitation of a classic.","

I can't believe how close they stuck to the original script, even word for word, line for line. I've never seen a remake that stuck so close to the original. They even brought back people from the original cast.If you've seen the original, you should for sure watch this, just to see what they did with it.If you haven't even seen the original, don't watch this. It's so bad.I miss Lindsay Lohan, and the rest of the Mean Girls that were brilliant.The musical aspect is probably necessary to set this apart from the original. It's not good or bad, the songs aren't good, but it's interesting at least.If you've ever driven by a massive car accident, and slowed down to look, then take a look at this movie.","

I was cautious of the remake - and held off on seeing it for a good while. However, I was completely proven wrong. It is a huge improvement on the original. Far more inclusive - and diverse which is a huge reason it's getting hate. It feels natural and representative of a high school in this day. Script updates work - and it's far, far funnier than the original. I love the fact that's it's a musical - makes it far more dynamic and entertaining. Some real bops too! The actors are incredible - and more believable as teens. Huge improvement. Can't wait to watch it again.","

Despite a few decent singing performances and fleeting appearances by an original Mean Girls cast member, Mean Girls 2 lacked the charm. Within the first 10 minutes, I was contemplating leaving. While some non-musical scenes were okay, the overall movie and cast were lackluster. Won't be revisiting this and certainly won't be recommending it. My popcorn, skittles, and Facebook feed were more entertaining than this attempt to capture the Mean Girls essence.""I do not recommend this movie, save your time and money and re-watch the original instead.","

The original film was fun and had a great cast ensemble. You may have a few cameos from the original.This film is fun. The opening scene of following two characters sharing a video on social media as they discuss there story. And than following Cady moving from Kenya to U. S. feeling left out and trying to fit in high school. Until she meets Regina and her queen bee friends.The cast ensemble is great. You ll see each character standing out. The musical sequences are over the top and fun. The film has some humor but some of it does seem plain and awkwardly forced.Overall, it is a fun film and it is different and energetic compared to the original.","

I do feel that some of the scenes were rushed and the acting was poor and awkward! Maybe that's just because I know the OG dialogue by heart, and I was expecting certain things to be said or done that were not. I do like that they brought Duvall and Norberry back, but there was no life in their characters which was disappointing! Also, Kevin rapping - ewwww! He can't even rap - at least the guy who played him in the OG was actually talented. I will end on a positive note - for a musical this wasn't bad! I thought Regina's character had a phenomenal voice!","

This movie is a 2-3/10 at best! 1. I HATE musicals. I'm ready for the High School Musical/Glee/Pitch Perfect phase to get phased out! BUT, I can't fault this movie too much, because I was the one that made the mistake of not paying attention to the fact it was a musical (thanks to streaming with not a lot of exposure to commercials, lol) It was still a stupid presentation of this movie, though. 2. I give it 2 stars because some of the scenes were artful and well done. For example, the scene where Cady freaks out when Regina kisses Aaron. 3 The girl who played Karen... her part could have been left out in the same way this movie should not have been re-made. Amanda Seyfried nailed it, and this girl stared to hard, and I just wanted to punch her face. Even Cady was stupid, just not as obnoxiously off base as the girl that played Karen. Could be the directing, though. 4. Overall, this movie sucked. It was a huge disgrace to the original! They should have taken the story and evolved it, not copied it in campy stupid musical form! I 100% regret that I gave money to support this horrible film.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","Socolorfull","15 January 2024","I will preface this by saying I have not seen the Broadway musical, but I have seen the original many times. I think the original is leaps and bounds better than this, but this was still a fun film and I recommend it for fans of Mean Girls or musicals.Renee Rapp as Regina George KILLED IT. She was by far the BEST part of this movie. While the Rachel McAdams Regina was a little nicer to your face and sinister behind your back, or delivered mean lines with a smile on her face, Renee Rapp's Regina was just plain mean and it worked. I'm kind of terrified of Renee's Regina. Really, the entire Plastic squad was well cast and had quite a few hilarious moments.Now, my girl Lindsay Lohan did Cady Heron way better than Angourie Rice did. I understand that Cady is supposed to be a vanilla, kind of forgettable kind of girl, but eventually she is supposed to be a plastic right?! Angourie's Cady is unforgettable. The charm and comedic timing that Lohan brought to the role was completely lost.The rest of the cast, including Janice and Damien, Tina Fey as the math teacher, and the cameos (I was so hoping for a Amy Poehler cameo but alas my wish did not come true) were a lot of fun.The music was good, and added some depth and extra info to classic scenes you'll remember from the original Mean Girls Movie.Overall, it was fun. I'd watch it again to watch Renee Rapp do her thing, but it won't be on repeat like the original Mean Girls is.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","hailey-45671","11 March 2024","As a millennial who was just out of high school when the original was released I find it HYSTERICALLY funny how many people are trashing this film bc it doesn't fit exactly what they wanted. How dare Auntie Tina evolve and speak to a younger audience than those of us pushing 40?! The whole moral of the story is learning how to divorce yourself from the cycle of trash talking other women and their choices to make yourself feel better. I ADORE this new version more than the original as a better message, more engaging, more interesting, and less littered with toxic stereotypes that are not genuinely funny. Auntie FIXED a lot of her biases and blind spots from two decades ago and a powerhouse young cast retold the retold story (this is based on a BOOK yall!) for their peers and younger siblings.The people that hated this are just incapable of joy, or spelling for many of these reviews, and it's truly a tragedy they got none of the lessons from the original work. Aunt Tina was wise to remove the sexist and race baiting fodder that these lost souls came looking for. I could not be more thrilled with not only the quality of this production but the sheer testament these bad reviews are making that no good lessons can stick from a work littered with attempts to appease bullies and imbeciles.The people who hated this and are so incredibly cruel about presenting their personal opinion forgetting all the real human beings involved in making this work are the exact people who need to watch this movie on repeat until they actually understand the message. That said, those of us pushing 40 and having fun with it are having a good time amongst ourselves and not a tear will be shed if yall show yourselves out.As we say in Texas, don't let the door hit ya where the good lord split ya lol Aunt Tina doesn't care, we don't care, the kids don't care, the only person made miserable is the miserable people who can't unclutch their ancient pearls long enough to have fun with something new.If you like catchy musicals and a spot on pacing between songs and dialogue and absolutely fabulous choreography, lighting and set, this movie is incredibly difficult not to love. Just leave your ""back in my day"" syndrome in the other room and remember how trashy the 90s and 2000s really were.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","TheZodiacDozenBooks","1 February 2024","Honestly, if I was writing this based on the first 30 minutes of the film, it probably would've landed at a 4/10 for me, but I found myself enjoying it more and more as it progressed. My wife and I went into it looking for a few hours' relaxation / a mindless popcorn movie, and that's what we got, so good job.At first, I sorely missed some of the original film's actors, but as I sat there I realized that nostalgia was a big part of that for me. Also, NOW I can say how much I love the original actresses who played Gretchen, Janice, etc... but that's because I've seen them in movies since/they've had 20 years to grow on me. All that to say, I think the new cast needs to be given a chance, and I expect to like this movie more as time goes on and I've seen them in other projects.I also think some characters were actually improved upon here. I liked both Damien and Karen better in this film, and Kevin G. Was right on par.I'm giving this movie a slightly weighted 7/10 to boost it's average, as I don't find the current 6.3 stars accurate. Giving this movie a 1/10 - or ANY movie that rating, tbh - is just being dramatic and dishonest, and is treating the film unfairly. Anyway, that's what I know.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","kaelyndavis","15 January 2024","So I haven't even watched this movie whatsoever but seeing the reviews and listening to the album track just has me so genuinely disappointed. I love Renee Rapp and from what I've heard in the soundtrack she did amazing because she has played Regina on Broadway.However the girl who played Cady should have been different. I get the girl who played Cady was trying to sing in an American accent but in that case it should have been an American actor. She had no emotion in her singing and it isn't as good as the original broadway production.Janis and Damien were played by decent actors and their songs weren't the worst but they should have given the girl who played Janis her song in the album and not just the movie. She was jipped. Along with the fact they took both Gretchen and Karen's part out of Meet the Plastics, at that point it's just World Burn Reprise before actual World Burn.I just believe I shouldn't waste my money on watching something I'm already let down by. Real theater people would know how poorly this movie was done without seeing it and just listening to the soundtrack. Renee is the only reason that movie had hope but the rest is completely awful. I just don't think there was any emotion in most of the songs except for the ones Renee was in.Stupid with Love has NO EMOTION it feels like she is being forced to sing it. It's awful. I had high hopes for this movie and I don't even want to see it now because of how butchered most of the songs are.","

Lindsey Lohan making a a cameo was pretty cool. The new Karen is hilarious, almost adds up to the original one. The new Gretchen sucks, just doesn't hit the same. Honestly the story is pretty much the same just modernized. You can tell that some of the original jokes where taken out because of the times and they had to be politically correct.

"Mean Girls (2024)","tobycross","22 February 2024","In the grand tradition of taking things that were perfectly fine to begin with and slapping on a musical number to see if it sticks, the cinematic world has been graced (or burdened, depending on your tolerance for high school drama set to song) with a musical reboot of 2004's ""Mean Girls."" Now, before you roll your eyes so hard they embark on an orbit of their own, let's dissect this glitterbomb of a film.First off, the color scheme. If Barbie ever decided to make a movie about high school hierarchy, this would be it. The palette is so bright and candy-colored, you'll be halfway through a bag of Skittles before the first chorus hits. But this isn't just any candy-coated spectacle; it's one with a soundtrack that slaps harder than Regina George on a carb-free day. The music in this reboot isn't just good; it's a character-driven symphony, each leitmotif weaving through the narrative like a well-placed burn in the Burn Book.Now, let's talk depth-or the notable lack thereof. Yes, the characters are as shallow as a kiddie pool in a drought, but they're drawn with such sharp, caricatured finesse, you can't help but be intrigued. They're the same Plastics we love to hate, but with enough of a twist to keep them from feeling like stale, reheated leftovers from the early 2000s.The cinematography deserves a shoutout. Transitioning from the wild plains of Kenya to the jungle of American high school corridors, the film employs some clever cuts and visual tricks that keep your eyes glued to the screen, wondering what they'll throw at you next. It's like being on a safari, if the animals were replaced with teenagers navigating the social pecking order.And the plot? It zips along with the speed of gossip through the lunchroom, engaging and entertaining without overstaying its welcome. This reboot brings a fresh twist to the tale, ensuring that even those familiar with the original will find something new to enjoy.In summary, the ""Mean Girls"" musical reboot is a high-energy, visually dazzling affair that proves even the most cynical among us can't resist the pull of well-crafted pop numbers and a dash of high school nostalgia. It's shallow, yes, but like the perfect Instagram filter, it knows its strengths and plays to them beautifully. So fetch your popcorn, leave your deep thoughts at the door, and prepare for a ride that's as entertaining as it is unabashedly flamboyant.","

The plot is nearly identical to the original but slightly updated to include a more diverse cast and actual queer representation. The music was decent but the pacing was a bit weird with a bunch of songs and then no songs and then more songs. I'm not going to be adding this album to my rotation. I thought the secondary characters really stood out, especially Janis, Damien, and Karen. I was really glad that Janis was explicitly queer instead of it just being a hurtful rumor and then her ending up in a heterosexual relationship. Cady was good but I didn't connect with her the same way I did with the original. Regina was a great singer but she wasn't mean enough. She was a jerk but I didn't feel like she was an awful person and want her to be torn down. Overall it was a pretty good movie and I might watch it again at some point.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","audreybeale","15 January 2024","The original Mean Girls came out just a little before my time - by the time I watched it, it had been so over-quoted that I couldn't enjoy the punchlines because I already knew them. The musical, however, I discovered during COVID and really enjoyed, so was excited to see this adaptation.Unfortunately, while I think there was a lot of potential and I loved every second Renee Rapp was on the screen, many sequences fell flat for me. It reminded me a lot of when Dear Evan Hansen came out in terms of weird editing choices for the music.Where the camera chose to focus during musical sequences were incredibly odd. Especially in the case of our main character, Cady, the music was extremely underwhelming and off-putting. Additionally, her songs all felt like they were meant to put the audience to sleep. 'Revenge Party's was the only song she was included in where I actually liked the editing choices. The 'fish eye lens' part seems very controversial but I thought it was a funny and different choice compared to her sitting alone in a CGI field singing in the beginning.For the song 'What is wrong with me?' that Gretchen sings, it came out of nowhere and felt very out of place. However, that didn't have to be the case! The writers could seriously take notes from Bollywood in terms of how to introduce a musical number in a song that is more heartfelt without weirding out the audience or putting them to sleep. Even the recent musical movie Wonka was able to pull off musical sequences in ways this movie falls flat.My favorite parts of the movie were anytime Janice, Damien, or Regina were present. They all stole the show in their own ways and deserve praise.Overall, this movie was not terrible! But it often took me out of the experience with it's odd choices to dull its musical edge. My hope is that future musicals come out, but that they learn from Mean Girls (2024) and Dear Evan Hansen.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","skirby-33125","12 January 2024","This version is friendly for 2024.Janis' identity is no longer the point of contention between she and Regina. Instead, she's open about her sexuality without it being the whole of her identity in the movie. Their disagreement stems from something petty and forgettable, which is the whole point, so I admire their willingness to alter that part of the story.Cady is not entirely convincing as a spy. There's no real reason why the plastics should believe she's part of their group, thus making the ""missions"" unsuccessful. She sways too much in the middle, not committing herself to either side of the line. Knowing how successful the initial portrayal of the film was, this was disappointing. The cunningness that Lohan's version demonstrated is what sold the movie.Still, the characters are fun and there were plenty of laughs throughout. The cast has chemistry, which is important.The movie appears to be shot through the lens of Janis and Dameon; it eliminates the monologuing we get from the original. Some of those moments were necessary for the plot. We get the same lesson from this version, but in a less-organic fashion.Overall, I would watch this film again, but the original film will likely always reign supreme.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","lyoung-14561","10 March 2024","There was no reason to remake this movie. The songs added nothing and weren't memorable.The original movie was much more compelling. I understand that they were trying not to offend viewers; the original was not very politically correct. However, the remake underestimated its audience. We don't need every scene explained to us; we are intelligent enough to draw our own conclusions.I have seen many movies that explained the problem, then showed the problem, then explained it again. Stop it. Your viewers aren't children. Trust them to understand the overall meaning of your movie without spoon feeding it to them.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","emmatiffaniegallagher","27 January 2024","There were a lot of parts in this movie that were to say the least...awkward. For example, the dancing in ""Apex Predator"" and quite a few of the jokes felt forced or just didn't land at all. There was an almost over use, of clips that were meant to look like TikTok or Instagram, it felt kind of out of place. Not to mention, the amount of brand placement was lowkey insane (specifically E.l.f.).However, and I don't know if this was intentional or not, that awkwardness, and brand placement, and over use of social media really does capture the life of what its like to be a real teenager. Because guess what these kind of cliques very rarely exist in high school and when they do it's very cliche and ridiculous for everyone involved.Similarly, one chief complaint I've seen is that the music doesn't sound the same in the movie and is less powerful than in the musical. While yes, it does sound different, its not less powerful its just a different kind of vibe. For example, with Revenge Party Cady's tone is more angry in the musical whereas in the movie her tone is more hurt. Also, show music and movie music are very different, so it makes sense that they would switch things up a little to make it come across on screen a little better.This movie had a lot of amazing things. The cast did very well and the casting department itself made really good choices (specifically with Jaqual Spivey as Damian, Auli'i Cravalho as Janis, and Bebe Woods as Gretchen). I loved a lot of the songs like World Burn, I See Stars, and I'd Rather Be Me.Also what movie with Renee Rapp wouldn't be good?!Overall, I think compared to the original movie and musical, Mean Girls (2024) seems lackluster. However, when looked at just by it's self its a decent watch that I would be excited to see again.","

The best by far in the movie is Rene rapp playing Regina George she is as good as broadway I loved her acting on the more negative side I wished the girl who played caddy could have been a stronger singer but she was still good after Rene rapp my favorite is the girl who play Karen she was perfect for the role I loved sexy it was so fun and honestly as good as broadway
All in all it was a awsome inbetween and something I would definitely watch again.","

Reneé Rapp sang fantastic and you could hear that she did it professionally. For a feel good movie, I thought it was fine. Feel good films are no longer a genre and I would watch them anymore, but if anyone wants a feel good film of this time I would recommend this one. I do think the fist films are always the best. They did do a good remake for this time. I don't like that they put famous TikTok's in the film. That made the film look cheap. But I would give it a 6. Fun to watch but wouldn't watch it again.

I recommend, but get ready for some subpar musicals that have you wanting it to end fast. Acting was good and current. Funny enough. Not overly saturated. Great diversity cast, although I wish they could have used a brown latin character rather than a white one. I don't think the younger generation would enjoy this either as I saw my 14 year old brother in law want to shoot himself every time the musical parts started. Overall would still recommend. Great job, but I will take the original over this one.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","votypkaj","12 March 2024","I found the remake fun and entertaining. It stuck to the original plot pretty well but was a little ""clunky"" as another reviewer has said. The songs were new and the cast could sing.That brings me to my next point to counter those that did not like the fact that a musical was made out of the original movie. This remake was based off of the the actual broadway musical and it did do a good job of replicating the production. Those that took hits on Tina Fey and others involved with this movie are uninformed and shortsighted.Regardless, I recommend viewing at least once for the soundtrack. Some very catchy songs are in this movie.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","hbdgtsgpjc","14 January 2024","I usually don't write reviews about movies but I really feel like this move needs one. I watched the original mean girls, when I found out they were rebooting it, I was excited and went. Though, I was displeased first thing off the bat. The song in the beginning with Janis and Damian was unnecessary, and I know it's a musical, though not every waking second has to be a song. Also, the song when Cady was in Africa was unnecessary. We could've skipped right to her going to high school. Also, majority of my favorite scenes were alternated or cut out completely. For example, the rocking on a pole (?) scene. Why add acrobatics to the dance? Why not stick with the original timeline? I was confused on why they changed it, was it to be modern? Either way I didn't enjoy it. Or the world burn scene, I was most excited to see Regina throw all the burn book papers around the school and each student to pick up their own paper, but no! She just placed the book on the ground and left, VERY disappointed, one thing I actually wanted to see was Janis and Damian kiss at the end of the movie (it's a funny part for me) but it was just cut out completely. Though the singing was good. I liked the soundtrack.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","yasmin_saleh","28 January 2024","This film is a remake of the 2004 film ""Girls Club"" with Lindsay Lohan. For me, this film (Mean Girl) was like a test film because I had the feeling that they weren't interested in working with the actors and the dialogue, only in the camera work.My suggestion for improvement:1. Acting: Some actors were really great. I could see in their eyes that they really liked their roles. But other actors should continue to work on their skills. Do not give up2. Dialogue: What was the point of this film? Why did you keep changing the characteristics of the main character? Who was really the antagonist?3. Technique: Chapeau to the DOP. I think this film was just a test for the camera because there were a lot of ""one-cuts"". Especially in the music scenes.4. Film poster: Whoever designed the poster, I was very confused by it. I thought Regina was the main character because she was the tallest on the poster, but I was wrong: it was the little person on the left.","

"Mean Girls (2024)","sissyrock","17 January 2024","They tried to fit a movie and a Broadway musical into one movie, and it flopped really badly. They didn't include half of the Broadway songs which give a lot of the characters their actual personality, and without it the characters were lifeless. Gretchen and Karen are huge examples. Not including their part in Meet the Plastics is criminal, and Stop was such a good song left out that would have been comedy gold. I feel like the plastics should have a spotlight. At least Karen gets the song 'Sexy' but Gretchen is criminally underused and felt like an extra. They didn't include her obsessive nature and desperation, none of her song moments, and in the actual movie she is sidelined so hard. The actual song changes too were flat and boring. Were they even trying? It's such a let down. Felt rushed and autotuned with way too much product placement. Save yourself the trouble and see the Broadway version. You'll have way more fun. Listen to the crappy movie version of Revenge party and the good Broadway version side by side and You'll see the Broadway is better in every way. Don't waste your time, just watch the amazing original movie or the Broadway version and not this mixed bag of low effort, boring version.","

Regina, Janice and Karen are all pretty good in their roles but the lead as Cady just can't sing and wasn't meant for the role. It had some enjoyable moments but it's pretty forgettable overall and that's a shame. Not to mention the ""fire crotch"" joke possibly referencing Lindsay wasn't cute.

Even my teenage daughters remarked, ""This has got to be one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen.""

Yes it's fun, very colorful, inclusive, modern, etc etc. It was overall a solid film, DEFINITELY not flawless. For me sadly, the flaws outlawed it for me.The musical portion is interesting.. definitely not the worst. These actresses & actors have talent! Their singing is amazing. That's not the issue though.. the issue is how weird and out of place these musical numbers occur. For me the storyline felt messy when told through singing.. it leaves out very important themes in which are a necessary to make the storyline carry on. It felt forced. Wayyy too forced for me. It didn't feel naturalTo add, the characters are shallow and extremely hard to connect with, going further to even feel sympathy for them. What makes the classic a true classic is how charming and addictive Regina george is. Heck.. even all the characters, they are so addictive and charming. The new musical characters are one toned and rather boring. They don't even feel like a real friend group. It feels so unnatural. The classic mean girls had that bond and vibe where you could just tell it was them against north shore.The ending felt incomplete.. the storyline didn't feel wrapped up and just felt like it was missing that ""girlhood is in harmony and it's all sunshine and rainbows now"". Obviously Cady makes up with her friends but still, it just didn't feel right..Overall a nice film, I recommend it for everyone but just heads up, storyline is hard to connect with and follow along as every second a phone camera on screen is being popped up.","

I knew because I watched interviews. Several in the theater could be heard asking what is going on? Cady's character is all over the place. There was no transition of her being plastic by the plastics. She is the same weird girl and over night is plastic after hanging out with them forever. There is a difference being smart and naive and just plain ignorant and not very bright. You have this girl that supposedly is a genius but she constantly goes through with the deer in headlights look. If you were looking at reliving Mean Girls, this wasn't it. Play the original and save yourself some heartache.","

I have not watched the stage production of this and I presume this film features the songs from it.

I didn't feel soul or connection from or with any of the characters. I truly think the remake would have had a better shot if it hadn't been turned into a musical.

I had no idea it was going to be a musical. I did not know about the Mean Girls musical or I would have figured it out. I felt the songs were insufferable. My favorite part of the whole movie was the Lindsay Lohan cameo at the Mathletes event. I was also disappointed that they kept the same stereotypical characters as matheletes.

And I didn't really enjoy the songs they did use that much. The music fell a bit flat. Which does not bode well for a musical.That's not my problem with this film though, it's supposed to be set at high school, yet they used a cast of adults to play the kids. It was really weird, it took me completely out of it, watching a load of women pretend to be 16 year old girls. I'm sure the list of teen actors waiting for the opportunity to play roles like these is long and ever growing, and instead of giving it to some young, up and coming, age appropriate actor, they cast women in their mid 20's instead?!

"Divergent","claudio_carvalho","13 September 2014","In a post-apocalyptic dystopia, the world is destroyed and only Chicago has survived with a society divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). The teenager Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) belongs to the Abnegation that rules the society but she fells outcast and attracted by the Dauntless. When she is sixteen years old, she is submitted to an aptitude test to indicate in which faction she will stay for the rest of her life, but she learns that she has aptitude to be in the Abnegation, Erudite and Dauntless. Further, she learns that she is a Divergent that is destroyed by the government. On the next day, she chooses to join the Dauntless where she changes her name to Tris and is trained by Four (Theo James). They fall in love with each other and soon Tris discovers that the Erudite are planning to take over the power from the Abnegation and become the ruling faction. ""Divergent"" is an adventure movie with a dull and lame story based in a stupid and senseless concept of society. The dystopia does not make any sense and everything is idiotic in the story: the society, the plot, the romance, the way the Dauntless jump from the train, the conclusion. If there is a faction formed for the most intelligent people, it seems to be obvious that they should rule this chaotic society. Tris kills many soldiers but she leaves Jeanine alive in the end. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Divergente"" (""Divergent"")","

"Divergent","kevinmorice","11 April 2014","Much like similar teen girl action movie series this one kills itself early on by introducing so many holes that the house of cards that they then try to build has no foundation. Before the credits are even over the story makes less than no sense. Having destroyed civilisation in a world war (ok) Chicago survives. The survivors had enough materials to build a massive wall around the city, 300ft high, but can barely feed themselves. Now they have split into 5 factions (actually 6 because they throw a lot of people out and call them 'factionless') and this somehow magically creates peace. So none of that makes sense, and much like Hunger Games, having built a nonsensical premise we now follow a teenage girl as she turns into a super-soldier capable of jumping of buildings fighting off trained armies single-handed (using a cheap looking paint-ball gun). All the while with her buff and perfectly capable new boyfriend doing as little as possible to help her. Oh and I forgot a quick detour while we ride a pointless zip wire through some buildings for absolutely no reason than to try and spend some of the left over special effects budget.And occasionally Kate Winslet pops up, but is shot from funny angles all the time while they try to make her baby look less visible. Not that they need to as her bad blonde hair is distracting enough.All in a total waste of 2 hours. Just go and watch Twilight or Hunger Games for the same movie done slightly (but not a lot) better.","

"Divergent","3xHCCH","20 March 2014","Just finished reading the book ""Divergent"" before the movie opened today. It was a quick easy read. There was obvious inspiration from various other futuristic young adult books I have read, like ""The Giver"", ""Ender's Game"" and the ""Hunger Games"" books. Like the others, the treatment of the story was cold, But its descriptions of the initiation rites were very much more violent. The setting is the walled city of Chicago after a great war. Their society is divided into five distinct Factions based on personality traits: Dauntless (brave), Amity (friendly), Candor (honest), Erudite (intelligent) and Abnegation (selfless). At the age of 16, a child takes an examination to help him choose which one will be his faction for the rest of his life. He may follow the suggestion of the exam results, or he may decide on his own. Those who fail to be accepted into a faction becomes factionless, as they become hopelessly poor and destitute for life. Our heroine Beatrice Prior has been born to the Abnegation faction with their grey clothes and disdain for any form of vanity. However, her examination results are revealed to be inconclusive, so she has to make her own decision. Meanwhile, an uprising is brewing in Erudite against the government run by Abnegation. I had some problem with the book and the way they try to make the Factions distinct from each other, when it is easy to see that overlapping does happen. These traits simply cannot be mutually exclusive from each other. It is also disturbing the way the author describes the Dauntless. Does being brave mean jumping off running trains, having piercings and tattoos, beating each other up mercilessly, or even killing yourself? This may give immature readers the wrong ideas about courage. o - o - o -The film was a perfectly conceived interpretation of the book. In the first few scenes where they show the color-coded clothes distinguishing each faction was quite clear. How director Neil Burger showed us most of the memorable scenes in the book, like the choosing ceremony, the jumping on and off the trains, the fear landscapes of Tris and Four, and the invasion of Abnegation were all very well done.There were some parts which were reinterpreted in the film. Most did not really affect the story-telling, like changing how Tris meets her Mom during Visiting Day, or glossing over a particularly violent episode where Peter stabs a fellow initiate in the eye. There was one big change towards the end about how a climactic surprise rescue transpired. I thought the version in the book was so much more better set-up and executed than the less-dramatic altered version we saw on screen.As I suspected, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely not the small and mousy Tris we imagine while reading the book. However, I thought Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of Tris' character, how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior. For people who have not read the books, they will not be aware of any discrepancy at all. Theo James had very good romantic chemistry with Shailene, so his Four never really felt like a threat to Tris, unlike the initial parts in the book. The director gave James a lot of lingering close-ups for the benefit of the teenage fan girls. Ansel Elgort, who played Tommy Ross in ""Carrie"" recently, now plays Tris' brother Caleb. His Caleb is less dynamic than I imagined him in the book. Coincidentally, Elgort has an upcoming movie with Shailene Woodley later this year called ""The Fault in Our Stars"" where they play boyfriend-girlfriend.More up and coming actors play other more minor characters. Zoe Kravitz, who was in ""After Earth"" last year, is not exactly how I envisioned Tris' best friend, but she won me over as the film went along. Miles Teller, who was recently in ""That Awkward Moment"", plays bad boy Peter, whose role in the film is much diminished compared to the book. Jai Courtney, who played Bruce Willis' son in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" last year, brutally plays Tris' tormentor in the training camp. Among the senior stars, Ashley Judd makes a nice comeback of sorts playing Tris' mother, who had major secrets of her own. Maggie Q played Tris' examiner and tattoo artist Tori with the requisite compassion. Kate Winslet plays the cool and calculating Erudite uprising leader Jeanine with icy perfection.Overall, I thought this film was a practically perfect interpretation of a book that was less than perfect in itself. So, whatever things the film might show us which we might not like, like the slow pace of action progression, and the questionable motives of the characters, are actually because the book told it that way. Fans of the ""Divergent"" books will find this film version faithful. While it cannot compare to the high standard set by the Hunger Games film series in terms of cinematic quality and character casting, ""Divergent"" definitely has its own entertaining appeal going for it. 7/10.","

"Divergent","Bruce722","6 April 2014","When reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate to film. It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.","

"Divergent","TheAnimalMother","8 September 2014","I have to say that the producers would have to be stupid not to use Burger again as the director. He did such a great job with this one. I thought I was going to see a film that was mostly aimed at teens. However the story alone makes this far superior to most teen oriented films. In fact this didn't feel much like a teen film at all. The fantasy story is a great metaphor for our current society, it's simply a very relevant film. The directing here was spot on. The story as fun as it is, does have a few holes, sure, but they are easy to look over because they are such small holes. The film simply works as a commentary piece on political philosophy, and as an entertaining action film laced with some romantic tension. In my view this film was far, far superior to the very teen oriented and very one dimensional Hunger Games, and it's certainly more unique as well. Woodley is impressive here, clearly showing the ability to play a very layered and complex character.8/10","

"Divergent","Logan-22","24 March 2014","I read the trilogy (which was nothing special and kept getting more annoying each sequel), but at least the first book had some kind of * something * to it. The movie sucks. It is boring and there is very little action (and what little there was is over too fast and not very thrilling). The violence is sanitized with the only real blood being when Four nicks Tris's ear with a knife toss. The two most horrifying scenes in the book are not even included: the attempted rape of Tris by Peter's gang and the transfer girl who jumps from the train and misses the Dauntless rooftop to splat on the street below. Tris doesn't have a ""save the cat"" moment early on and provides no real reason to ever like her.The story takes too long to get going, then the training goes on forever, only to have the ending feel rushed. Not once did I feel anyone's life was in danger. Not once did I perceive any credible romantic chemistry between Tris and Four. Not once did I laugh, cry, or feel anything but bored. And it goes on for two and a half hours! Ugh. Sure, the production values are high, but who cares if I can't relate to any of the characters or the story? It's just a dumb waste of time. I didn't hate it (only because I scored a free ticket), but have no desire to watch the sequels.However, I'm glad Divergent made a bunch of money opening weekend to pave the way for other YA books to be adapted into films, but they need to do a better job. The reason all the recent YA adaptations tanked at the box office is because they sucked (Vampire Academy, Beautiful Creatures, City of Bones). The only decent one I can remember was Warm Bodies.","

"Divergent","tandrei2001","27 March 2014","I went to see this movie misled by the high rating on IMDb. Unfortunately it looks like Hollywood makes movies for people with short memory. I admit I haven't read the source book, but I guess I wouldn't, judging by what came out of it. I hereby venture myself in saying that the book is also a bad SciFi novel. It has way to obvious imports from well known themes that have been exploited to the brim by today (like the ""perfect"" society that sacrifices diversity for peace, the ""different"" guy that stands-up to the system, the genuine technology that controls individuals (poorly described, by the way), the fear confrontation ad the list could go on and on. It is not essentially bad to bring these themes in a movie, but I see nothing new, original here. So... if you have seen Equilibrum and the Hunger Games then you know it all. Movies today are just mobile phones... keep reproducing ""features"" from the competition, while it is supposed to be an art. Another thing can't stand in movies in general is the poor IT incursions. I am talking about the scene in which Jeanine is asked to turn off the ""control system"" which consists of a huge touch screen in which she just hits some ""cancel"" button. That was really pathetic... Anyone could have done that right? Another thing that I can't stand, is the cheap psychology things in these movies. They are all based on some sort of psychoanalysis which is long time deprecated in therapy. But it is somehow considered to be ""cool"" and ""trendy"" by producers to insert these kind of flavour into the movies to make it more profound. Or are they just as stupid and ignorants as the target viewers? Anyhow... to me, this is bad taste in art. If you want to really go for it, you must do way better that that and if you can't, then at least make it more interesting. It is also true that movies like ""Inception"" don't occur every month, but once they do... they set a trend and everybody will just take a byte of it. Don't get me wrong, it is a ""watchable"" movie, perhaps a little too long for its story, which, by the way, is very predictable and full of clichés. I read some users claiming it resembles ""The Hunger Games"" and so it is, especially with the modest ending that awkwardly announces a sequel. I could predict how the story developed and ended after the first 15 minutes and that's what makes this movie mediocre. Script is mediocre, but at least it does not abounds in stereotypes so it's bearable. What can be said about acting... there is no acting in this kind of movies, you only need to be young and good looking, be able to learn your part and you're done. It's not that the actors are bad, but the movie itself is not based on any acting mastery and just because of that, the girl gets a plus for making something out of it. I am curious if the ratings will stay as high as now in time.","

"Divergent","ironhorse_iv","11 September 2014","Divergent was indeed made to capitalize on the popularity of the Hunger Games book & film series by author Suzanne Collin. Some people might say, it's a total rip-off, but in my opinion, author Veronica Roth was influence by the books and inspiration to make her own. It's no differ, than Suzanne Collins taking elements from previous novels like George Orwell's 1984 and Koushun Takami's Battle Royale. For people to say, Divergent is a total rip-off of Hunger Games is an understatement. If anything, the movie is more influence by novel works like Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Dart, Orson Scott Card's Ender Games, and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Even the movie takes bit of its story from films like 2010's Inception by Christopher Nolan & Mark Water's 2004's Mean Girls. Other influences come from the Meyers-Briggs personality tests, Milgram experiment, and attitude toward divergent thinking (ATDT). This is a Psychology major fan film. With all this influences, Divergent create its own identify. The movie starts out in a futuristic dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). Members join a faction based on their preference but are initially given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Every year, 16-year-olds undergo a serum-based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit, but something went wrong, with Beatrice's test; as she shows that she has more than one personality trait, meaning that she's a Divergent. Since Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them, they're considered threats to the existing social order. The premise can be too far-fetched, improbable and illogical. You have to suspense your disbelief on this premise, as it's hard to believe that people can only have one personality trait. Since, it's a Sci-fiction film, anything is really possible. Personally, for a movie that supposedly has a lot of one-dimensional personality characters, these characters really do have a lot of divergent type traits. The pacing is a bit slow, as most of the time, the film focus on her time with the Dauntless. The training kinda did go a little too long. The plot could be a bit confusing, with all the tests, they go through and seeing how some test matter and some don't. The whole exposition somewhat got lost between the transfer from book to screen, as it wasn't that clear to the audience. Seeing how this film is the first one of the 3 books with the sequels Insurgent and Allegiant on their way. This movie will leave you with more questions, than answers, if you haven't read the books. Even if you readt the books, there are some minor different from the book to the film. The dream scenes were a bit longer in the book. Some characters such as Peter (Miles Teller)'s level of bullying is reduced to verbal comments as in the book, he's more engage in sexual abusing, and physical provoke her. Another big missing piece from the book is one of the character getting stabbed in the eye. Hopefully, they can fit that in, the next movies. Nothing too big was change in this film, so it's a fairly well adapted movie. The acting is pretty good for the most part. Shailene Woodley nearly quit acting in 2011, so it's good that she didn't, as she was great as the main lead. Theo James as her love-interest was pretty cool to have. The only problem is that Theo James acting really doesn't stand out. If anything, he kinda could be mistaken for James Franco. The supporting cast made out of Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoë Kravitz, Miles Teller, Tony Goldwyn, Maggie Q and Kate Winslet were all great in their own roles. The movie could need some more minority characters. I don't know if it's part of the story, with the white washing due to its being a post-apocalypse or Hollywood just being ethnic bias. After all, the United States seems to be home to large groups of immigrants of many races and ethnicities and they rarely depicted in films like this. Even Hunger Games had more ethnic characters than this. It really doesn't look like people from Chicago. I also would like not everybody looking like a model. It kinda hurts the realistic tone that the film is possible to represent. The movie was shot beautifully by director Nick Berger. The mirror scene alone had some really good symbolism. The music choice was pretty good. My favorite had to be Run Boy Run – Woodkid. I wouldn't say this movie is a chick flick or only for young adults as there is enough material for everybody to relate to. Overall: It's a surprisingly good YA sci-fi action drama thriller adaptation. I'll be looking forward to the sequels.","

"Divergent","Thanos_Alfie","8 February 2016","""Divergent"" is the first Sci-Fi movie of this trilogy and in this movie we watch a world that is divided into factions and each person has to be a part of one. Unfortunately Tris cannot be a part to any of these factions because she is a divergent. Divergents are considered as the most important and dangerous people and have to be eliminated but why?I liked this movie because it has a different kind of plot from other Sci-Fi movies and that's something that made this movie interesting at first. The direction which made by Neil Burger was very good with many good action scenes. Also the interpretation of Shailene Woodley who played as Tris was very good. An equally good interpretation made by Theo James who played as Four.Finally I have to admit that I did not expect much from ""Divergent"" but it was a very nice surprise. This movie made a very good start for this trilogy and I hope to continue like this and even better.","

"Divergent","jackmeat","21 August 2014","Settling in to this film, I expected to see Hunger Games again. Set in a near-future Chicago, what we see is another take on the dystopian society. The central plot here is that growing up in this walled in world, everyone must fit into one of five classes. But of course, the question here is what if you don't fit into the nicely packaged definition of a single class, then you must be Divergent, or in this movie, a danger to the perfect society. When our main character, Tris (played very well by Shailene Woodley)finds out she is Divergent she must hide this secret and discover the reasons why it is such a secret and why society fears Divergents. I'll leave all of that for you to watch unfold in the various physical and psychological training exercises that are portrayed on screen. In a nutshell, the world painted is similar to that of Equilibrium but with much less action. This is not a bad thing, since this allows the cinematographer to reveal a very wonderfully crafted view of this world. The pacing of this movie moves along nicely as we plod through Tris trying to fit in as a part of the Dauntless clan. Friendships are made, lost, and so on as expected. Even more so is the romantic involvement with the mysterious Four (or 4) played by Theo James (which I believe over acted his part entirely too much). So the mystery of why the government wants to kill all Divergents must be unraveled and this leads to the majority of the story. I was happy with just sitting back and enjoying the view during many of the scenes that were almost breathtaking. Not reading the book, I hope that the movie did well to portray the story but I also know it is a trilogy so they couldn't go from start to finish all at once. Stand alone I believe the movie was quite well made and under-appreciated, swept under the rug by the highly successful Hunger Games series. You will be hard pressed not to see the similarities between them. I am looking forward to seeing what else this world has in store for us and would recommend that moviegoers join me to find out. Will you see silly acted parts, and scenes that are just there to draw you in with nice landscapes and perfectly choreographed music, YES. But why would anyone complain about something like that? I know I wouldn't. Enjoy this film, you won't regret the time you spent on it.","

"Divergent","MovieSonic","29 July 2014","I'm glad I got around to watching this, I'm not sure who's writing the negative reviews or what they were expecting but I can honestly say that this is the best tween film I've seen in a long time.It IS a tween film, it's blatantly aimed at young girls and as a ""twenty-something"" youngish female, I'm not embarrassed to say that I really enjoyed this film. It's pure fantasy fodder of course but here's what I liked about it:the relationship between the two leads develops naturally i.e. they don't see each other and go 'you're my soulmate', in fact they don't really get on at first so this is believable and refreshingthe lead actress (Shailene Woodley) playing Tris is extremely natural and one of a very few actors I've ever seen who has convinced me that they are grieving (usually grief in films is just 'oh, they're dead, I'm so upset' ... swiftly moves on with their day..) - Actually both of the leads (Theo James as well) play their roles really wellI loved the point of view shots like when Tris looks at Four during the training and you see it from his perspective and then the camera cuts to his face to get his reaction to the look she gives him (there are other similar scenes) and it just adds to the effect of feeling like these are real people and I empathised with them more as a result Yeah the background story for the city is quite thin but who cares, stranger things have happened in the real world and what I like is that we're given a sense of 'this is what they've been told but is that what's really happened?'. I'm not sure if that's in the book or if the film makers wanted to add some realism for us grown-ups but when they question what's out there, I got the feeling this might be similar to The Island (2005) - that's not a spoiler it's just my opinion and probably totally off baseI have now watched this film about 4 or 5 times because I really liked so much of it: the fighting was believable for me because I think we've all gotten used to flashy choreography and sound effects but that's not what real fights look like or how they sound so for me, these fight scenes are really good. I liked the weapons because they kept it simple and for training, they're a good idea.Probably the thing I liked the most is the fact that ""it's not all about Tris"". I mean, it IS all about Tris but it's not 'totally in your face, the world revolves around Tris and no-one else matters' all about Tris... What I mean is that there are some ""films"" out there which spend their entire running time having the supporting actors running around warning the lead actress not to have sex with her boyfriend lest he destroy her vagina but in this film, the lead actress often shares centre stage with her new best friend, there are a lot of scenes where she is in the background looking out as opposed to a lot of shots of her standing alone / in the centre and we see her friend fighting too; the focus is just not 'always' on her. Having said that, I do think that there could have been even 'more' focus on the people around her. First of all, had we gotten to know her friends better, we might have empathised with them more (trying not to include spoilers!) and also, this will sound harsh but it needs saying, I'm sick of seeing 'ethnic' people in minor or reduced roles: what a waste of Mekhi Phifer! I wish that Zoë Kravitz had been given more to do, yes she had a decent amount of screen time but I would have liked to maybe see her 'fearscape' and... that's about it for ethnic characters I think... yep.I liked that Jai Courtney's character didn't go overboard as the villain but again, his character was a little one dimensional and I would have liked to have seen some more interaction and dialogue between him and Four just to flesh out their background story.Kate Winslet honestly did the best she could with her part and it's a massive credit to her that she managed to make me severely dislike her and believe that she was evil with just a few odd lines here and there. Her role is to literally just pop into the film every now and then to be a bit menacing and give off a female-Hitler vibe (bright blonde hair). But she pulls it off in my opinion. There's no point in elaborating on why someone is pure evil, we know this exists, it's happened in the real world and it's still happening so her role didn't distract from the believability of the story.Overall, I liked the subtlety of the story. There is no sex, no profanity, no overt 'I love yous' yet it didn't come across as 'after-school-specially' at all. Also, I never groaned out loud once or cringed or had to hide my face behind a pillow while someone professed their undying love for someone they just met a week ago. The dialogue was realistic with occasional over-rehearsed acting from some of the supporting cast but I really loved this film. Go into it knowing it's a tween film and that there won't be a lot of intelligent scientific explanations for things and you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.9/10","

"Divergent","shawneofthedead","19 March 2014","When beloved books make their way to the silver screen, the resulting movies are usually met with much frustration and rending of clothes from amongst the literary faithful. A character is changed beyond recognition; a crucial plot-point excised; an important theme lost in the murk and swell of a film. Oddly, Divergent isn't actually a bad adaptation. In fact, Neil Burger's film is as good a version of Veronica Roth's wildly patchy source novel as you're likely to get. Whether that makes for a good movie - especially for people who've never read the book - is another matter entirely.Divergent begins in a post-apocalyptic Chicago divided into five factions, each valuing one virtue - Dauntless (courage), Erudite (wisdom), Candour (honesty), Amity (kindness), and Abnegation (self-sacrifice) - above all others. It's an odd system, perhaps, but one that is apparently necessary to keep chaos at bay. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) has been raised in Abnegation but, try as she might, she cannot completely subsume her self or her desires. Indeed, the aptitude test that everyone must take at the age of sixteen suggests that Tris doesn't belong in just one category: she is Divergent, equally at home in three factions.Come the day of the Choosing Ceremony, she decides to forsake her family to become Dauntless: a decision that plunges her into a nightmare initiation process in which the weakest are summarily kicked out of the faction. As Tris navigates the politics and perils of her chosen world, trying all the while to hide the fact that she's Divergent, she encounters her fair share of allies - Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Will (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) and possibly her charmingly broody instructor Four (Theo James) - and enemies, including the brutal Eric (Jai Courtney) and vicious Peter (Miles Teller).Anyone unfamiliar with Roth's book might find themselves trying to puzzle through this seemingly shapeless mess of a plot. It ebbs and flows in odd directions, dancing around Tris' desire to be true to herself, before it gets a little lost in the dystopian clutches of Jeanine Matthews (a gleefully icy, evil Kate Winslet), an Erudite leader hellbent on bringing down the entire Abnegation faction. Along the way, Tris literally battles her fears under the influence of a simulation serum, toughens up physically, strikes up a sexy chemistry with Four and frets over her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort). Within the confines of this universe, it makes an odd kind of narrative sense, but the logic of it all never really bleeds through.Here's the thing, though: this strange, frequently illogical plotting is very much a defining characteristic of Roth's novel - and, in fact, becomes more of a problem as the trilogy progresses. (Anyone who's read Allegiant, the controversial final novel in the series, will know just how difficult it will be to adapt.) The emotional and logical flaws present in Divergent the film, then, are - for the most part - already inherent in the book. Why does Jeanine, supposedly one of the smartest people in the community, plot and plan the way she does? How does the entire society function in this utterly dysfunctional way? Technically, Burger can't really be faulted for failing to develop a coherence and logic that was never there in the first place.In fact, Burger actually substantially improves upon the novel in several ways - he keeps the film mostly free of Tris' inner voice, which becomes increasingly moony and silly as her crush on Four grows by the day. Burger plays up a zip-line sequence that highlights the joyful recklessness of the Dauntless, as Tris soars freely through the midnight air. He also handles the problem of Tris' fear landscape very well: instead of simply willing herself out of the influence of the serum (as the Divergent can do), she must figure out how to face each of her fears in a non-Divergent way. These scenes are shot with quick, simple visual flair, dispensing with some of the novel's trickier convolutions.Of course, Divergent isn't a perfect adaptation either. To Roth's credit, there are some truly dark, painful moments in the novel which transcend its loopy narrative. It's no surprise, and yet it's a little disappointing, that these bits simply vanish from the film, no doubt in the interests of securing a PG-13 rating. As a result, Peter is a far less repulsive antagonist than he is on paper. For instance, he doesn't brutally (and casually) maul a fellow initiate who's doing better than him in the rankings - an incident that's crucial in the development of his character in the subsequent novels.The young cast works hard and quite well together. Woodley makes for an intriguing screen presence, effectively playing both the steel and softness of Tris' choices. James, heretofore best known for dying in Lady Mary's bed in Downton Abbey, acquits himself reasonably well - he's not as leaden as some of the trailers have suggested, and he forges a believable chemistry with Woodley. Of the supporting players, Teller is the standout, so good in his easy malevolence that he actually makes the thought of Allegiant as a movie quite appealing.In the final analysis, Divergent is likely to divide audiences. Fans of Roth's books should be, on the whole, pleased. This is a frequently very good, intelligent adaptation of a rather problematic novel. Everyone else, however, might be less enamoured of the final product: a film that, just like the book on which it is based, boasts a compelling story and some great ideas, but is also messily executed, overly complicated and a tad nonsensical.","

"Divergent","moviexclusive","19 March 2014","Every studio hopes for a hit YA franchise, and in particular for Lionsgate-owned Summit Entertainment, the imperative is even stronger seeing as how they had unearthed that lucrative segment with the 'Twilight' series. And so 'Divergent' comes with high hopes that not only will it become hit YA property, it could potentially enjoy the same astronomical success as 'The Hunger Games', especially since both are of the sci-fi genre set in a post-apocalyptic world with fresh young faces.Adapted from Veronica Roth's book, it imagines a dystopia where society is organised into five distinct factions based on personality types, each understanding and playing its role in order to keep the peace. These are Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite, the names rather self-explanatory in describing what they represent. Youths are tested at the age of 16, given two likeliest factions from the results of a hallucinatory test, and then at a Choosing Day ceremony made to pick one of the two in which they choose to belong.As narrated by our lead character Beatrice Prior (The Descendants' Shailene Woodley), there are those fit into more than two categories which are labelled 'divergents' and cast out to live as homeless vagabonds on the pretense that they do not belong. Needless to say, Beatrice is a titular 'divergent', and warned by her testor (Maggie Q) that she must keep this information secret lest she be the subject of a witchhunt led by the leader of the snobbish Erudite faction Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet). So at her ceremony, unlike all the others, she exercises her free will to join the Dauntless, who train to be soldiers keeping the peace.Even with the task of laying franchise groundwork, it is both surprising and disappointing how much time the movie spends inside the subterranean Pit where Tris and the rest of her initiates train under the tough yet tender Instructor Four (Theo James) and the harsh and controlling leader Eric (Jai Courtney). From sparring to knife throwing to shooting, screen writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor spend about an hour laying out Tris' Dauntless boot-camp training and the dynamics between the trainees, in particular with two Candors - one a snide competitor played by Miles Teller and the other a loyal friend played by Zoe Kravitz.There is of course the budding romance between Tris and Instructor Four, the latter of which turns out to be a 'divergent' himself and who ends up teaching her how to overcome the final 'fear test' of her training. At no point however does director Neil Burger inject a sense of urgency into the proceedings, which unfold relatively unhurried and without consequence until the final half-hour. It is at best a drag, at worst a bore, and while parallels have been drawn between Tris' training and Katniss Everdeen's in 'The Hunger Games', you'll find the former here oddly devoid of danger or purpose.Only in the last segment is there some measure of thrill as a power struggle between the Erudites and the Abnegations build up into real conflict unfolding on the streets of an already war-ravaged Chicago. Burger assumes that his audience's patience will eventually pay off in a rushed final act that throws everything it can into the mix - including some heavy urban warfare, exposition, shifts in character - but it is a peculiar case of 'too much too late' that ends up making you frustrated more than anything else. There is little poignancy even with two key supporting characters meeting their demises within the short span of ten minutes, and that is also a result of the film's flawed construct, which diminishes the familial bonds illustrated in the novel between Tris and her parents (Tony Goldwyn and Ashley Judd) and twin brother (Ansel Elgort).With little chance to flex her acting muscles, Woodley is hardly any match for Jennifer Lawrence, and indeed doesn't quite grasp her character well enough to put forth a consistent and compelling portrait of Beatrice. At least she does share some screen chemistry with Underworld: Awakening's Theo James, the bond that builds slowly between them rather winning to say the least. Other thespians like Winslet and Judd give solid supporting turns, though they are yet again hemmed in by a ham-fisted script that hews too closely to the book's straightforward prose.On his part, Burger tries his best to build a convincing vision of a futuristic Chicago, but fails to convey the extent of a hyper- militarized and technologically advanced society on the verge of factional conflict. The postwar cityscape hardly leaves much of an impression, though the drug-induced mind trips that Beatrice takes boasts some degree of visual ingenuity that recalls Burger's far superior work in 'The Illusionist' and 'Limitless'. Worthy of special mention though is the score by Junkie XL (with Hans Zimmer listed as executive music producer), which hits the right notes more than you would expect in certain scenes.Still, it's hard to imagine 'Divergent' being the kickstarter the way the first 'Hunger Games' movie was; though both share similar narrative blueprints, this adaptation feels inert where the latter is lively, failing to engage its audience with its female teenage protagonist's rite of passage. Unless you're a fan of the books, you'll probably be lukewarm about the next instalment 'Insurgent' whose production is already underway; indeed, true to its title, there is something off about 'Divergent' that never quite reconciles even till the end of the movie.","

"Divergent","davispittman","21 April 2016","Divergent is an entertaining movie to sit and enjoy, that's for damn sure, it was actually better than what my expectations preceded. Shailene Woodley shines in her staring role as Beatrice, and Theo James is so perfect for his co staring role as Four. My absolute favorite actor here though is hands down Kate Winslet, she is so focused, determined, and unapologetically devoted to her maniacal plot, and it's obvious that she gave it her all the entire way through. The costume design is wonderfully constructed, especially for the Elite characters like Winslet. And the set direction is awesome to look at, very well put together. The action sequences are pretty standard PG-13 action movie material, not meaning that in a bad way, just saying you know what you're getting when it comes to that specific issue. The plot is very intriguing and it will for sure keep you interested and wanting more. Ashley Judd is great to see on screen here as well, a very noble addition to the well rounded cast, she is caring, adventurous and warm hearted in her motherly role to Beatrice. I really loved the dialogue back and forth between the characters too, very intelligent and witty. I cannot wait to sit and watch Insurgent, and then Allegiant, crossing my fingers in hopes they will prove themselves worthy, like this first installment did. An 8/10 for Divergent!","

This is another politically correct tripe. The plot is based on countless Hollywoodian stereotypes. Actors all look like they came out of catwalk fashion show. They have as much substance and personality as bobble head dolls. The film is tedious, move at a snail's pace and do not even fall into the category ""so bad it is good""It is embarrassing to know that there are those who classify this sophomoric attempt at literature as a dystopian science fiction novel.Pure waste of time, money.","

"Divergent","Tweekums","10 July 2019","This, the first film of three, is set in a world one hundred years after a cataclysmic war. Chicago is effectively a city state and as far as anybody knows there is no civilisation beyond the city. Society is divided into five factions to which people join based on their character type. These are Abnegation, the selfless who are also the governors; Amity, the kind who farm; Erudite, the intelligent; Dauntless, the brave who form the police/army; and Candor, the honest who serve justice. At sixteen people are tested to see which faction best suits them before making the choice as to which they join. Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior, the daughter of Abnegation parents, is one such youngster but her tests are inconclusive... she is 'Divergent'; one with strengths in multiple areas. She is cautioned that she must hide this as Divergents are considered dangerous. The next day she joins Dauntless and begins her training; if she does badly she risks failure and being declared factionless but if she does too well she could be identified as Divergent and killed... if that weren't enough she learns that the leadership of Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation.From the moment the world is described it is clear that the viewer will need to be able to suspend their disbelief... the idea that almost everybody will fit into one of the five described factions and Divergents will be rare seems unlikely. However if you can accept that the film is rather fun. The story may not provide many surprises but there are plenty of exciting moments as Tris and her fellow Dauntless recruits undergo initiations and training. There is also frequently a sense of real danger. Tris; as played by Shailene Woodley, who impressed in the role, is a fine protagonist and other key characters are solid too. The film has high production values with a realistic look and impressive effects. Some have compared this to films like 'The Hunger Games' but while there are some similarities I didn't really think about them at the time. Overall I thought this was as solid addition to the young adult dystopia genre... you certainly don't have to be a teenage girl to enjoy it. I'll certainly be watching the other films in the series.","

"Divergent","aker995","7 April 2014","As I said, the movie was extremely predictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did and I honestly felt like I was watching it for the 3rd time! There were no twists, no suspense, no surprises. I could not believe that there would be so many clichés and unrealistic scenes. Instead of an ""action/adventure film"" I saw a boring love story. I can't imagine how unbearable it must have been for those who read the book..*SPOILER* The following scenes are examples of why the plot was so obvious and boring: We knew that Tris would not go into the same faction as her family, we knew which one she'd choose, we knew that she'd fall in love with Four, we knew that she wouldn't get kicked out of training, we knew that Four would find out that she was a Divergent but wouldn't tell anybody etc... Moreover, the scene where Tris and Four fight is so unrealistic and again, the fact that he started fighting on her side was way too PREDICTABLE. *END OF SPOILER*To me, Divergent looked like a bad version of the Hunger Games and I am really surprised that so many people liked it. Unless you are a teenage girl who finds Theo James hot and unless you have never read any books or watched any other movies in your life, I see no reason why you would want to waste 2 and a half hours of your life watching Divergent.","

The whole faction idea is really interesting to see. The journey Tris goes through feels natural and not forced. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are equally great as Tris and Four. I thought Zoe Kravitz did a fantastic job as well. The romance is one of the best I have seen in teen movies. The action is suspenseful as the movie goes on you end up wanting more.
This movie ages well and never feels bland.","

"Divergent","fast-giga","23 July 2014","Of course this movie is made for a very young female audience so I have problems to identify myself with the targeted audience. The good point about the movie is, that the heroine is not complelty depending on her male counterpart, so its none of the ""girls-are-mentaly-and-physically-too-weak-to-exist-without-man"" movies, but thats about it. If you want to watch something about strong female characters try the legend of Korra. The rest of this movie is terrible, especially the huge amount of brain bleeding inducing logic errors.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!! For Soldiers knife throwing, jumping from trains and excessive hand-to-hand combat are the most important skills. As well as being complelty fearless...people throw knifes at you and you aren't allowed to be afraid? Yes, thats the stuff marines are made of. Being a soldier has nothing to do with endurence, guns, tactics and unimportant stuff like that real life soldiers train.Being ""divergent"" not fitting into a faction is something rare...at least thats what the characters say...funny how the rarest thing turns out to be a majority.The training officer sits at the same table as the rookies, but the rookies aren't allowed to talk to him? Yeah, makes sense.A rookies says something stupid to a teacher...and they put in into the world wide newspaper...yeah, nothing else interesting happening.Oh, I nearly forgot, the actual most important thing for a solider is house climbing. Know a soldier who hasn't climbed the empire state building? He's a noob.These are just some of the terrible brain bleeding inducing logic errors in this movie. If you are a 8 year old girl you might be able to accept them, but for everybody else this movie isn't watchable.","

"Divergent","september_90","29 October 2014","My review is not based on reading the book but solely on the movie alone. I found the movie very similar to The Hunger Games in the sense that it divides people into groups and focuses on the teenagers. But this movie was 100x better! It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. This movie is inspiring and motivational. It is the type of movie that shows that accepting people for the flaws and their strengths is important and that everyone is different in their own way and that it's okay to be who you are. I think more kids need to see these types of movies and I would recommend it to anyone. P.S. Do not watch this movie before or after The Fault In Our Stars cause it may make things a bit weird haha.","

"Divergent","goods116","24 March 2014","For some reason the rating is 7.7 with 1000s of data points, but the written reviews trash the movie -- ignore them, the numerical score is accurate. I read the books and saw the movie and thought both were very good -- not incredible, but good, deserving of 8 out of 10. One the key complaints is the same one you always hear when a movie is adapted to a book: how could they have not included scene/event/character x,y or z from the book? So and so does this in the book, but in the movie they do y. And so on. Give me a break. Does this really need to be repeated? You can't really convert a book perfectly into a 2 hour movie. You just can't. Characters get cut, shortcuts are made to the plot. Live with it or don't see the movie. Getting to the movie itself now. Yes, there are flaws and some logical missteps. But overall, the world that is created is visually appealing and interesting, the character (especially Woodley) do a good job, and the last portion, while a bit rushed perhaps, is engaging. I would say that the source material itself is not 10 out of 10 material, and the movie conforms to my rating -- very good, but not a 9 or a 10. If you can get over the book/movie thing, you will enjoy this movie.","

"Divergent","david-selin","16 April 2014","Four is the name of an important character in the movie. Apparently, it stands for poor writing, poor directing, poor casting, and poor acting.Let's start with the poor writing. Obviously this movie would be more enjoyable if one had read the book. Well, I hadn't, and therefore I was confused because the back-up story was non-existent. The movie takes place in an dystopian society. However, nobody tells what really happened to the world. Without adding any spoilers, it is hard to specify why the quality of the writing is constantly so poor, but let's just say that the story is so full of holes it looks like an emmental cheese. Poor directing. Good directing could have compensated for the ludicrous writing, but in Divergent they seem to form an unholy alliance. The scenes lack credibility - especially the action ones. Because of this, Divergent is a movie for the children at best. There are three characters that look somewhat the same. It took constant effort to keep on track on who is who. The absurd changing of the scenes didn't help. However, the biggest mistake of the casting crew was hiring Shailene Woodley. Sure, it is cool to see a relatively new face in a big budget movie, but there is a reason why it is so rare - they cannot act. The previous statement takes me to the final part, which rendered this movie close to unwatchable. The actors consist of young and inexperienced actors mostly. Because of the cheesy writing and directing, their acting seems even more horrible than it already is. Again, without including any spoilers, I won't go any deeper, but just watch the so-called ""chemistry"" between Tris and Four... Makes you feel awkward, huh?Finally, I want to clarify that I usually like dystopian films. In this case, I was expecting a rating of 7 or 8, so I'm still quite shocked because the movie fell below my expectations so badly. It just makes me so disappointed that this kind of budget goes to absolute waste because of these flaws I mentioned above. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are a big fan of the books!","

"Divergent","YJLcool","23 March 2014","After the tremendous success of Twilight, Harry Potter and Hunger Games series, Hollywood film studios have made several attempts to repeat the success. But, many have failed to capture the hearts of fans and general audience alike. Now, here comes another young adult sci-fi action drama thriller series...The Divergent Trilogy. Will it succeed and remembered as one of the good young adult series? Time will tell.Adapted from Veronica Roth's first book, it is a story about the conflict between individuality and social conformity...the dilemma of being different, not fitting in with the society and the fears that comes with it. It raises the question on why people in general, submit to social conformity (obedience and unwillingness to change), without any resistance. Is it really deeply rooted in our genes? Why individualists are mostly frown upon by society and feared by the authorities?The film offers an interesting world with strong characters, an engaging plot enough to captivate the audience for its long running time (140 minutes). In a post-apocalyptic Chicago, the people are divided into a five-faction social system, enforced by the authorities to maintain peace and order after an unspecified catastrophic war, based on their primary distinct personalities: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (kindness), Candor (honesty), Erudite (intelligence) and Dauntless (courage). The film starts out with the lead female character questions her place in society, but later on, she starts to question the fundamentals of the society itself.Much of the film's running time is dedicated to develop the characters enough for the audience to know them, by showing what they're going through and what they've become by the end of the film. The lead actors, Theo James and Shailene Woodley, delivered a solid performance in their respective roles and have a convincing on-screen chemistry between them. Kate Winslet, despite her short screen time (only about 20 minutes), manage to solidify her presence throughout the film, hinting that we'll be seeing her more in the next two films. Moreover, the ideas and concepts behind the psychology aptitude tests to determine which faction the characters belong or join are commendable as well, as they show the inner fears of the characters and why they possess the personalities mentioned in the film.However, some parts of the film feels rushed, especially the third art of the film, due to its heavy world-building, plot and character development in the first and second act. The fans of the books might complain about the missing parts, but from a person who haven't read the books (me), it seems fine and acceptable to me. I believe the film gets the essence of its source material right, despite the complex nature of its source material.Regardless of what the critics or fans said, the worlds and characters of Divergent and the Hunger Games are very different. Each stands on its own and shouldn't be compared with one another. The film has a good start. By the end of the film, I'm interested to see how things will be unfolded in the next sequel, Insurgent, which is releasing next year and how the story concludes in Allegiant, which will be released a year after Insurgent.Rating: 8/10 ""Individualism promotes personal freedom and achievement. Individualist culture awards social status to personal accomplishments such as important discoveries, innovations or great artistic achievements. Unfortunately, this threatens to those in power, the survival of a population of conformists that specifically adhere to well-defined rules and principles. So, the ones who are capable of thinking differently than others are usually rejected or deemed as outcasts in society. This creates a constant, endless struggle between individuality and conformity throughout the history of mankind.""","

"Divergent","HaveWisdomWillTravel","22 March 2014","I won't compare Shailene with JLaw, who I like. Basically, Shailene has presence, her acting authentic, she delivers what this role called for, and that's that. I want to address the audience's favorable response versus the ridiculous professional critic scoring.Of course the film is not perfect, in a way Gravity or Hunger Games are not perfect. But why should it be? Of course it has flaws, like, the typology of the factions - where is the Artist/Creatives? Without imaginative power we will all die of boredom or fascism. Also, Intellectuals/Scientists and Straight-talking Factual sort tend to flock together, too similar to be separate factions. The parent characters under-used, the girl feels a little over-coddled...etc.Still, no big narrative crimes, nothing deserving a hysterical fail rating. Those who never read the book, who have enough open-mindedness, with hope only to be engaged and entertained, will likely enjoy the ride. The premise was interesting enough, the direction and styling effective, the movie's story world construction well-executed, the story-telling and pacing engaging, the acting performance by the two leads and Winslet and Maggie Q well-balanced, believable and non-jarring, the resolution was convincing enough... So what's up with the 40%/ 4 stars hysteria among the pro critics? I have my theories...In general movies get anywhere between 1:1, 1:2, or 2:1 audience love it VS critic love it ratio. This one got 2:1. Which means, the film not only hit the right note with a progressive crowd, it also diverged greatly from an unspoken dogma. 40% pro critic here and elsewhere, wow, obviously Divergent hit a sensitive nerve with the film industry's Erudite equivalent. It seems, Divergent the movie is itself a divergent in its own context, a potentially uncontrollable menace to a rigid, retentive, non-divergent, evidently HOMOGENEOUS English language film critic culture...But in this case, I'd go by the Audience's score. For starters, a 1000000X larger sampling size is always more objective than a few hundred homogeneous Erudites. My rule is, movies with 1:1 audience:critic ratio, the rating is most objective. 1:2, the truth is somewhere in between. But if it's 2:1, the critics are upset about some game-changing ""threats"", and the truth leans strongly toward the audience. Works for me anyway... I call this the AUCRIT Ratio. Feel free to test it yourself. Onto Divergent...I've never read the book. I do keep my expectations on neutral when watching a mainstream big-concept film - especially yet another adapted post-apocalyptic science fiction targeting young adults.Those who expect futuristic science fictions to have primarily male leading characters esp in power positions, invincible biological strength, brute force solution, outcomes determined by technology especially Very Cool Weapons, non-stop magical actions, hot sexy androids and fetish costumes will be disappointed. Those who *demand* award-winning plot and ""logical"" science in futuristic fiction movies are just being hysterical, for they tend not to notice the fantastical magic, bad physics and overkill tech in their ""serious classic"" science fictions - from star trek, star wars, 2010, batman to iron man are equally full of gaping logical holes, mostly with no award-winning plot-craft.Truth is, ""hard"" science is evolving constantly, and science fiction flicks are not made to be 100% accurate or to win awards (if so Blade Runner still wins today), but to explore possibilities in highly-compressed scenarios, to inspire, to enlighten, and foremost, to entertain.In today's myopic, easily self-satisfied world which classifies and judges people by preconceived notions about ethnicity, gender, profession, appearance, merits, we are constantly divided by rigid specialization, subjective education qualification rules, redundant scientific dogmas, simplistic morality yardsticks, always under pressure to choose factions: With-Us-Or-Them, for or anti welfare/ abortion, JLaw-vs-Hathaway, Pepsi or Coke, the in-betweens be damned.Identity by Tribe (and inevitably the side-effect of xenophobia and authoritarianism) is a timely topic, how The Power That Be and their obedient citizenry react to the exceptional, multi-talented, multifaceted generalists who dare to defy categorization.And this is no Twilight. More Hunger Games meet Enders Game. Definitely gender-neutral in appeal, at least among under 30's. Not everything with strong female lead written by female authors equates Hunger Games or Twilight or Harry Porter. Some ancient mindsets need to get used to the brave new world with the other half of the human population, women, being visible half of the time.The lead actors also defy categorization in their own way. Here's yet another hot young male lead who has brain and brawn and talent and emotional depth all rolled into one person...yet another intelligent and talented and cute young female lead who doesn't over-groom herself nor perpetually pout nor seem like she's out to please everyone or martyr herself. Does the world need more unaffected chicks and unassuming hunks? Of course, there's never enough of those on screen.Divergent may not be The Matrix or Inception grade, but why should it be. I was definitely engaged and entertained. Good enough for me.","

"Divergent","Phillip_Tomasso","22 March 2014","I suppose this will be as much a book review as it is a movie review. I went with a group of friends and saw Divergent yesterday morning. The Pg-13 film was 139 minutes long. I will start my review by saying it was over in the blink of an eye and left me wanting so much more.Prior to the release, critics blasted the film. It received an average 3.5 out of a possible 10 Stars on I.M.D.B. This made me apprehensive. Critics also kept comparing Veronica Roth and her novels to Suzanne Collins and The Hunger Games. Scathing reviews said that Divergent was nowhere near as equally riveting as The Hunger Games. The stories are nothing alike. The only similarities I saw come from a strong female teen lead character. Is Katniss anything like Beatrice (Tris)? I suppose, but she is also completely different; motivated by a unique set of circumstances. No. I change my mind. Other than both being female, and teens, and the main characters of their own trilogies -- there are no other similarities. (Do not get me wrong. I enjoyed The Hunger Game books, and so far, the movies. I am just missing the point as to why the two sets of books/movies are being compared. There isn't one. And they shouldn't be).Personally, if you have not read the book Divergent and see the movie, I suspect the movie will be complicated. Not un-followable, just complicated. The plot is not simplistic despite being geared toward teens. I do know several people who have since seen the movie without having read the book and enjoyed the film just the same. Anyway . . .Set in a futuristic Chicago, a community is enclosed behind an electrified fence. The community is split into 5 Factions to keep things running smoothly. The intelligent faction is known as the Erudite; the honest, Candor. The peaceful people are known as Amity, and the brave, Dauntless. The selfless faction, the one Beatrice belongs to, is Abnegation. One is born and raised in the faction of their parents. On your sixteenth birthday, teens undergo a test to see which faction they actual belong in. Regardless, a person can pick to be in any of the other four factions, or stay in the faction they were raised in. When a teen chooses to leave the faction they were raised in, it is upsetting. They must say goodbye to their family. There is a good chance they will never see them again. And if you fail in your knew chosen faction, you can not return home. You become what is actually the 6th faction. The Factionless -- those who don't belong to any faction, and live like the homeless, scavenging for food, and clothing, and shelter. . .Beatrice's test results are inconclusive. They do not point to any one faction. Instead, they point to them all. She is what the government calls, Divergent. This is dangerous. Divergent do not think like anyone else, and therefore are a threat. Forced to keep the test results a secret, Beatrice must pick where she feels she best belongs.Abnegation has always been in charge of the local government because they are selfless and can therefore be trusted with politics. Beatrice discovers a plot by the Amity to overthrow the Abnegation. Chemical injections given to Dauntless will leave their minds susceptible to suggestion, making them dangerous and unstoppable --since the Dauntless train to be warriors, the police of the nation, the protectors of all.The movie is constantly compelling. The time flies. Beatrice (Tris) is played by Shailene Woodley. Never heard of her before. She nailed the role of Tris. (She reminded me of a young Tatum O'Neal. The way she talked. Something about her eyes, too. (The Fault in Our Stars will be released later this year, starring Woodley, as well). With forthcoming releases of Insurgent and Allegiant, she will surely be a star to watch.Theo James portrays Four. He also someone I have never heard of prior. At first, he was not what I pictured when reading the novel. Seemed a little too old. However, as the movie progressed, I think I saw what casting directors picked up on during auditions. He was Four. No way around it.While directed by Neil Burger, written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor, Roth did not give up her creative input. She also helped write, and co-produce the film. Good for her. Although some story elements from the novel are missing, overall the movie stayed mostly true and on point. Compelling and action-packed, great acting, and some intense scenes (yeah, I jumped once or twice), I found Divergent so entertaining. I cannot wait for the next in this bound to be popular trilogy.

"Divergent","DareDevilKid","29 July 2014","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsThis is one of those rare occasions that a movie based on a recent young-adult novel has been done right, so savor it for what it's worth. And, worth it is, quite a lot, going by the terrific 2 hour 10 minutes ride you get through the stark dystopian landscape of ""Divergent"". What's more, the movie is not just about bleak dystopian locations and the direct bearing they have on the daily lives of their characters, but it also shrewdly manages to raise some highly pertinent questions about our own existence and what sort of world we could be leaving for the coming generations. The most uplifting fact about ""Divergent"" is that it pulls off this unexpected act through astute direction and some incredibly nuanced performances we usually don't associate with summer blockbusters.While, Kate Winslet is an old warhorse and has played practically every type of role with grace and confidence, Shailene Woodley is a revelation, and proves yet again why her name is being taken in the same breath these days with Jennifer Lawrence as one of Hollywood's brightest, upcoming female talents. She captures the desperation, confusion, grit, determination, vulnerability, and tenacity of her character with the kind of self-assured conviction and realism you'd associate with seasoned performers. Kate Winslet as usual just shows up and reminds us of her immense abilities in every frame she's in, playing the villain with menace and an uncompromising faith in her misguided beliefs. Ashley Judd lend great support in the few scenes she's in. Sadly, the rest of the cast offers nothing worth penning down.Now we all are well aware that this film is based on the first of a series of best selling fiction novels by author Veronica Roth, but as alluded to earlier, it's an aberration that the core elements of a good novel are retained while making it viable for a cinematic audience within cinematic time-constraints. For this reason alone, due credit must be bestowed upon screen-writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor for brilliantly adapting a recently loved novel, fresh in readers' memory, and transforming into a crisp screenplay that the Director and producers could work with. But, a screenplay - adapted or original - no matter how good, needs proper guidance, and this is provided with assured measure through the watchful eyes of Director, Neil Burger (known for accomplished efforts such as ""The Illusionist"" (2006), ""The Lucky Ones"" (2008), and ""Limitless"" (2011)). Alwin H. Küchler's cinematography could have been engaging and Richard Francis-Bruce and Nancy Richardson's editing could have been crisper, but thankfully they do not steer too far away from the plot.""Divergent"" not only gives us a fantastically entertaining blockbuster to thrill and chill us for w hours plus, it also offers up a thought- provoking sci-fi tale, which begs us to reflect on some startling points it raises even while we're being enthralled by the proceeding on-screen - something of an oddity in modern cinema. Along with being faithful to Roth's book, it also builds a strong cinematic universe apt for the screen and successfully manages to engage both sections of viewers - those who've enjoyed Roth's novel and even those who have no prior knowledge of the happenings of her dystopian fiction series. ""Divergent"" is basically a must-see for all who enjoy a thoroughly gripping, judicious sci-fi tale.","

"Divergent","ecatalan98","2 November 2014","I'm amazed to read most reviews here. It seems to me that most IMDb readers/users think of themselves as ""film noir"" critics, or maybe the second coming of Roger Ebert. When I watch a movie, I like being entertained. Sure, the story must be good but not necessarily plausible. If that was the case, movies like STAR WARS or even TITANIC would've been colossal failures. DIVERGENT was such a movie: entertaining, teen-oriented, post- apocalyptic fun. In the not so distant future we find out that there was a terrible war. Little is said who started it or what provoked such devastating war. What it is clear is that mankind survived and made strict rules for its new society in order to ensure the peace. This new society has been classified into different personality categories, or factions: abnegation, candor, dauntless, Amity and Erudite. Each strata of this new society complements the other factions so to keep a harmonious balance. The members of this society reach a certain age (18, I guess), they go through a series of tests that will define their definite personality, regardless if they come from a different faction. This new society's motto is ""faction before blood"", so one has to be more loyal to his or her faction than to their families. Those who do not fit in any faction are called (most obviously) faction less, but they do not pose a threat to society, simply an uncomfortable burden (they are the homeless, the tramps, the scum). As the movie moves along we find out that there is another profile of people who also don't fit in, but pose a supposedly ""serious threat"" to society. These are called ""divergent"" and are to be terminated as soon as they are spotted. Divergents possess qualities of all factions, they are like a ""greatest hits"" of factions.As you might guess, the movie revolves around a girl named Beatrice ""Tris"" and her finding that she is a ""divergent"" and how she must survive in a society that has no room for her kind.Shades of THE HUNGER GAMES are evident all over the place. THE MATRIX too, even FLASH GORDON (1980), but all done in very good taste. I found myself enjoying DIVERGENT significantly more than THE HUNGER GAMES (at least the 1st installment), which I'd like to remind all IMDb critics is a ""light version"" of BATTLE ROYALE. We get to see Kate Winslet (TITANIC) as the baddie. It was never clear to me if she was the President or what, but she seems to be in charge of this new society. Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn are in there too and that's about it as far as ""names"" in this picture. All other actors are basically teens or twenty somethings, so yes, there's a strong effort from the filmmakers to attract a young audience (like THE HUNGER GAMES). Anybody who's worked for a big, multi-national corporation will quickly see the similarities between the dystopian society portrayed in this movie and the company they might work for. Companies ALWAYS want to label their employees, as if we could only be ONE type of personality, so I found this intriguing. I supposed most ""Roger Eberts"" in IMDb barely perceived this. Was it a predictable movie? Most movies are, in a way. All Disney movies have happy endings, don't they? Being predictable is not a sign of being a BAD movie. I found DIVERGENT getting more interesting and interesting as frames passed by. It has good special effects and the acting is quite bearable. Trust me, I've seen far, far worse movies that end up being praised as the ultimate in cinema. If you didn't like the movie, that's OK, you're entitled to think and say whatever, just as I'm entitled to say that DIVERGENT was a truly entertaining, interesting and fast paced futuristic movie. If you ask me, I enjoyed it far more than the over-blown HUNGER GAME series.","

"Divergent","mreynolds9662","6 July 2014","This movie was terrible. It was awful. And infuriating. It made no sense. This movie is the epitome of crap. In fact, instead of watching this near 2 1/2 hour movie, watch a piece of crap. It will have a better plot than this flick. The first hour and forty-five minutes (precisely) are spent on the wrong thing. It makes reference to the ""government"" (cough CAPITOL) to being some sort of evil, but rather focuses on Tris becoming part of a cult. It doesn't even make clear what they do. It gives no reason to why they are in ""factions"". There were so many plot holes I would have thought Tommy Wiseau wrote it. The guys name is Four. Four. Apparently the author of the book thought, ""Well, anyone who reads this is a moron anyway."" Four. Why? Why? WHY???? I understand that this garbage was only put together to make money, but did they have to assume everyone is an idiot? Couldn't they at least let it make sense? Or shorter? Or less cheesy? Or better acted? Or more focused? Or more intelligent? There was a point when Tris argues with Kate Winslet's character that them choosing isn't a matter of free will. Or at least she almost does. Right when it seems like the movie has any brain they shut it down in a hurry. There is way too much wrong about this movie. If I continue I will only be hurting myself by spending more than ten minutes thinking about this movie.","

"Divergent","Jac23443","29 March 2014","If this is truly based off a book, then God help those who actually thought this movie was good. Personally I have not read the books, although from what I saw in this movie, I am glad I never have. What kind of movie is this anyway? There was nothing pinnacle about this movie, nothing iconic, nothing that caused me to want to get up out of my seat and scream at the top of my lungs that was incredible because its all been done before. The army being controlled for God's sake was a pathetic attempt at being the slightest bit menacing, if menacing was what they were going for, it was pathetic. Then don't even get me started on the point where Tris gets to Kate Winslet, seriously!! No security to guard the most important person in the whole movie, the person who was behind the taking over of ABNIGATION, seriously?! Okay. There was barely any character development in any of the other characters except for Tris and Four and even that was done poorly (the revelation that the father beat Four when he was younger, if the movie really wanted fear to be felt, my God they failed). This movie SCREAMED young adult book, but then again the Hunger Games was a young adult trilogy, and all I could do was cover my mouth and hope the characters didn't die, and I know there is a part one and two coming out soon. This movie left no cliffhanger, nothing to the imagination, nothing to make a person ponder positively over what they just saw, it just happened to happen. There was nothing that dazzled and that is something I am noticing in most movies coming out these past few years. There isn't an elaborately put together story, its just put together in the way that's most clear to its audience, it is almost as if creators of movies nowadays don't want a thinking audience. AND THAT IS SAD, as sad as this movie was. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, due to its soggy and cringe-worthy script, poorly placed emotion, and over-told story. Thank God I got Game of Thrones, the Hunger Games, and Marvel movies to save me from movies like this. Seriously folks do not waste your money on this movie! I am giving this movie a five out of ten due to the fact that it tried, but it wasn't anywhere near as great as it could've been.","

"Divergent","scott1-912-252003","22 May 2014","I took my 12 year old son to the movies on a ""guys day out"" last weekend. We left Mom and sister/daughter at home. Anyway, we had a great time and it was a good movie to take my kid to see. I must say this isn't a hugely serious review, but a review nonetheless. When a movie leaves me thinking about it for days or weeks after I watch it, there is something to that. There is also something to be said about how this story relates to modern present society. Square pegs go into square holes, and when someone is too divergent, they seem to suffer in our shallow, worker bee society. The movie was entertaining from the beginning to the end, however I felt like there was no closure in the final scene. This is probably because the story is a series, as it should be, if it's based on the books. I loved the way the movie made me think about myself. This is where the genius of this film blossoms. Everyone I've talked to about the film, and everything I've read on the Divergent fan site is rooted in how people feel about themselves and how they fit into our current society and culture. Because all the excitement, plot, and direction of the film is borne out of the Dauntless faction, I've noticed that everyone who's watched the movie now wants to be Dauntless. Why not? It's exciting and they are pretty bad-ass with the black clothing and tattoos. For me personally, I was Dauntless as a former cop who sports his share of ink, but now a full fledged Candor or maybe even an Abnegation since I'm one of five running our local government. Really, I'm Divergent like most people. We generally don't fit into one category as human beings and that's the moral of the story here. Human nature is eternal and cannot be curbed no matter how you structure your society. The film as a whole was really well done. The plot flows, the tension is always there, the mystery seeps in now and then, and the action is outstanding. The lead actress is pretty, yet tough and smart, but young and has a lot to learn. That is the point though. Bottom line is that I loved the movie and I'm still thinking about it a week later. I will definitely own the movie when it comes out on disc. I can't wait to play it for my wife and daughter.I also found out that the lead actress is from my home town and went to my high school. I'm more than double her age, but it is very cool that she is from my neighborhood and went to my school. Because of this, the movie has even more meaning to it because, again, the story made me think about how I relate to this world and where I fit in.You can also take the faction quiz on the fan site. Everyone in my family took the test. My son and I came out as Candor the honest. My wife Dauntless the brave, and my daughter Erudite the intelligent. Of course this was just for fun, but interesting because there is truth in those results. (my candor is coming out again). This movie will be very successful because it's a lot of fun and a great story.Update (Spoilers!): I read the book and really enjoyed it. There are some differences from book to movie, but I have to say the movie (all things considering) did a great job with keeping the story in line with the book. Tris was never last on the points board. She was first initiate by the end. The stun darts were paintballs in the book. The movie skipped the very important scene with the factionless man on the street. Mom didn't sneak into the warehouse. She came to the pit on visiting day. Tris never visited her brother, didn't fight the first day, mastered the gun the first day, wasn't going to be executed by three with guns, but by drowning in a tank, etc. Lots of details left out or changed in the movie, but it was still done very well and reading the book AFTER watching the movie didn't ruin it.","

"Divergent","anisandaru","12 May 2019","Divergent is a science fiction film in action, fantasy and adventure. The divergent was officially released on March 18, 2014 in Los Angeles. The film was directed by Neli Burger, Evan Daughterty, and Vanessa Taylor.
The divergent tells of the city of Chicago which was destroyed by war. To create peace, 5 factions formed according to personality. Abnegation that is unselfish and simple. Erudite is smart and prioritizes science. Good and peaceful Amity, Candor who prioritizes honesty, and Dauntless who is brave and free. Whereas Divergents are people who have more than one faction in their personality.
Children who are 16 years old must take a test to choose a faction. After the test, Tris has 3 results there are Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite. Tris must keep his identity as a Divergent. During the selection ceremony, Tris finally chose Dauntless. It turns out that only 10 people will be elected as official Dauntless members. Because of abstinence and intelligence, Tris managed to become a member of Dauntless.
But chaos occurs when Erudite controls Dauntless's brain to attack Abnegation. Tris who is not affected by serum pretends like the others. At that time, Tris knew that For was also a Divergent. Eventually an attack was carried out by Erudite against Abnegation. In addition, Divergent hunting is also underway. However, all can be thwarted by Tris, Four, Marcus, Caleb, and Peter. The five of them fled with the train go to beyond the wall.
This movie have an easy to understand path. In addition, the acting of the players successfully supports the story. Divergent films are in accordance with the character of teenagers who want to find their identity","

"Divergent","Prismark10","25 July 2014","Twilight found a teen female audience. The Hunger Games found a teen female audience. They also sold a shed-load of books.Now its the turn of Divergent but this film fails. Like The Hunger Games this is a future dystopian society but this one has ever running trains that never stop at train stations. It certainly gives the phrase 'a running jump' new meaning. Even a bit of Ender's Game is thrown in here.In a Chicago which is now a massively walled city after a devastating war, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave, and Erudite the intelligent. However there is sixth group that are the faction- less who are outside society and regarded as outcasts. No one seem to questions the role of these outsiders who are left destitute.Members join a faction based on their choice but are given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Her father serves on the ruling council along with the head of Abnegation, Marcus Eaton (Ray Stevenson).Each year when kids turn 16 they go through a serum based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit. Beatrice test shows attributes of several factions meaning she is Divergent. She is told to keep this a secret as Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them. During her choosing ceremony she becomes a Dauntless.So like The Hunger Games we are told that the ruling government has magically found peace after a devastating war and everyone in society is happy apart from the faction-less. We see people happily working the land, some helping each other and the protectors running and climbing things. It certainly looks like Prozac Nation.Beatrice suddenly joins other Dauntless teenagers running and jumping in and out of trains and soon becomes a super soldier. Yet she does not realise that her training superiors are less comrade in arms and are actually horrid and mean, changing the rulebook. People who fail various stages of training become faction-less and this does not ring any alarm bells that society is not what its cracked up to be.However there is plot afoot for Erudite leader (Kate Winslet, unrecognisable in a blonde wig) to get rid of other Divergents and take over the government by getting rid of Eaton.Apart from a silly plot that is full of holes, the acting is rather weak, the characters have no charisma and the film is dull, looks cheap, overlong which makes it drag even more.Twilight had a romantic sub plot that sucked viewers in as well as dealing with issues of teens in a new town. The Hunger Games had Jennifer Lawrence, a genuine star in the making as well as the survival concept. This film has very little to offer apart from mixed messages. You soon forget which group is who and of course any viewer will realise that humans simply cannot be compartmentalised so easily as they do in this film, we all have certain mixed attributes. Therefore we are all faction-less.","

"Divergent","cjgrayso","16 April 2014","This is perfect storm of bad movie making: a stupid story, bad acting and bad directing. Who is ultimately to blame? Money grubbing CEO's. Who else? Thanks to the mega-success of the Hunger Games and Harry Potter, Hollywood's scouring young adult books, like some pedophile in a playground, looking for new material to get their greasy hands on. Divergent is one of those series. I've not read the books, but in the movie, you belong to one of 5 factions. Our heroine does not - she's divergent - and that apparently frightens the powers that be. Why? Because individualism is seen as a threat. In much the way independent film makers are perceived a threat in Hollywood. What follows is one inane, dumb, idiotic scene after another. I was rolling my eyes most of the time or laughing out loud at some of the nonsense I was watching. I almost got up to leave, but it was like watching a train wreck. That would be more entertaining.","

"Divergent","clubber2k","12 January 2015","I ignored this movie at first since it was released close to hunger games, looked the same, and had the least good movie trailer. but that trailer did it no justice.this is a movie for those with some imagination. likes dis-utopian worlds or maybe apocalyptic worlds. some said the story is unbelievable. how can everyone be a work drones except one woman? well I'll tel you, this is exaggerated but it still reminds me of old social / communism ideal world. everyone has its place and does what he is told for joint harmony. this reminds me of my parents always doing what is needed what they are told and expecting me to do something just because everyone else do it. and like in communism everything is good and peaceful and right. except the leaders which can do what they want to shape it. oh and kill those who pose a threat to them. yep communism.but no there's a new generation. just like my gen. the Y generation, that stopped doing what we are told, and instead started to ask ""Y"" questions - so did this one girl. there are others like her but she had the best instinctive to make a change (you'll see). all the charterers have a relevant background to how they act because of who they were. now they choose to do things different because of who they really are now. and that is what makes the shift. this could have happened a few years before or in another 100 years. when doesn't matter, only they who and why do.so whats wrong with it? 1. well it is a bit cheesy at times. they romantic part is predictable, simple yet believable in the movie world. 2. somewhat predictable. the story doesn't hide the main characters and the big issue, this is not a spy/cops thriller. there is no big twist. you enjoy following the characters and chain of events and how the characters react to it.I think this movie does everything hunger games did not: 1. its shorter. no need to wast your money and times. 2. the world is much more believable. not relevant but this is still our world. not a fully crazy imaginary one. our world just something happened. only this city matters. maybe there are others, maybe there are not. some said that hey don't understand how a poor civilization built this city but the civ isn't poor at all. its spends its wealth where it needs. some parts look bad, some look good.so final words, this is movie is a fun ride all along. those who didn't enjoy it are either too oldish (45+) to understand the idea (those who said this is a teen movie should realize under 40 isn't' teen, they are just too old for it). or maybe too dense to see beyond the basic simple story to see the message. this is our world. serfs and lords. kids and parents. workers and business men. those who do as they are told, those who try to control the lesser ones and those who try to find the in between. do what you want because you believe it to be right. if you are one of those, you will enjoy this great and fun movie. I know I did.9/10 from me. yep. and I'm not a teenager. 30+ straight male, how do you like that?","

Sounds like ""The Hunger Games"", doesn't it? Well, ""Divergent"" also uses this story. I had never heard of this series before the first movie got released. Having seen the movie, I can only conclude that they simply used the idea behind ""The Hunger Games"" and added a bit of Harry Potter (the serum-induced psychological test to determine a person's faction reminded me of the Sorting Hat).So, this franchise doesn't come across as anything original. I wish that someone would film Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Years of Rice and Salt"".","

"Divergent","Spazplayer20","21 March 2014","DIVERGENT delivers where so many of the recent young adult novel film adaptations have failed. I saw this film not having read the book and on its own it stands very well. First off the bad:1) action sequences feel slow and not natural. You can tell that the actors were not particularly familiar with hand to hand combat, not to say their characters weren't supposed to be but even when they're supposed to know how to fight it feels lackluster. 2) obvious age difference between the two main characters. 3) high school Clich feel for the first half of the film. Now with that said ^ here is what Worked: 1) length. Often we see film adaptations of novels try and cram everything into 90 or 100 mins but Divergent takes its time. Normally this would be a drawback but the film makes good use of the extra time (the film is 145 mins) to really progress. 2) the performances of the main characters are solid. Nothing amazing but the dynamic between the two main characters works well. - the visual style of the film is very good. The dystopian city of Chicago is very well realized. 3) brings to light moral and societal problems. Suprizingly deep for a young adult film.OVERALL divergent is a good film. It fails in few places but succeeds in most that count. With the failure of young adult movies such as Percy Jackson, Divergent healthily separates itself from them. I would recommend seeing it. There WILL be a sequel.","

"Divergent","galdude9021","19 July 2014","I was actually pretty excited about watching this movie. My cousin thought it was great and better than Hunger games, so I read the books before I watched the movie. I liked the books, but there were a few things I wasn't satisfied about. The relationship between Tris and Four is confusing and spontaneous, completely out of the blue and random. In the movie it is worse. They barely know each other, Tris' ear gets cut from Four, then Tris is making out with Four topless. They didn't include a lot of the important characters, like Uriah and Peter's crew. They barely acknowledged the characters they did put into the movie and there seemed to be no importance in them. Al's suicide was a big thing in the book and it didn't really make an impact in the movie, there was no significance, I wouldn't have felt any emotion if I hadn't read the book. Will, Christina, Tris and Al's friendship is too muted and you don't really get to know any of the characters well, the character development was non-existent, . Four of the characters I couldn't really tell apart from the others, Will, Al, Peter and Drew looked pretty much identical. Too much is left out and there are too many changes added to the movie that make no sense. In Tris' fear landscape it seems that Four is trying to rape her and she has to violently fight him off. In the book it is playful and she ends up laughing it off. Edward's knife stabbing in the eye accident is also left out and that was an incredibly important scene.This movie just really disappointed me, I never really get disappointed with movies, but this just frustrated me too much.The books and movie both had great potential but were just a little bit off.","

All in all, the movie was a perfect blend of comedy, mystery, action, drama, and romance. Thus, a new fan base was created.The only problems with this movie were the acting was a bit shaky at some points and it diverged from the books a lot too (see what I did there).

"Divergent","neil-476","11 April 2014","In post-apocalyptic Chicago, the Sorting Hat puts Katniss Everdeen in Slytherin, not Griffindor.This film, which appeared in the UK with no pre-publicity at all, no trailers, nothing, is apparently based on the first of a trilogy of Young Adult novels, which is curious for what is clearly - given cast and production values - a Major Motion Picture.The good news is that it is quite nicely realised - a good budget, solid production values on screen (some nice eye candy), good and well-delivered action, a strong cast, and a pleasing central performance from Shailene Woodley as Katniss. Sorry, ""Triss"".The bad news is that is so busy trying to emulate the Hunger Games and Harry Potter transposed into a cookie-cutter post-apocalyptic dystopian scenario that it often forgets to be its own thing. I know my synopsis above was somewhat sarcastic, but I honestly sat there thinking ""This bit's from Hunger Games. This bit's from Harry Potter. Oh, Hunger Games again."" This is a very derivative piece which hasn't worked hard enough to forge its own identity (or hide its sources, if the two are not the same). Which may explain the lack of publicity.Oh, and the fictional status quo of the five factions-based society (this film's version of The Hunger Games' Panem) makes little sense when examined closely, and raises more questions than it answers. Someone didn't think things through.So my verdict is that it is somewhat dumb, overfamiliar with its sources, but not unenjoyable.","

"Divergent","planktonrules","7 February 2015","To me, 2014 seems to be the year of the shallow attempt to recapture the financial magic of ""The Hunger Games"". First you had ""Divergent"" and then you had ""Maze Runner""---and all three games are aimed at the same audience and are pretty much the same movie in so many ways. All are set in a manipulative futuristic dystopia and all are aimed at creating franchises that will bring in the audiences like lemmings--ready to toss wads of cash at the studios. Don't get me wrong--these aren't bad movies but they are clearly lacking in creativity because the plots are, beneath it all, EXACTLY the same. All feature a plucky nobody who ends up somehow being different--and able to destroy the evil system despite the odds. Whatever....all I know is that because they all follow this formula there really isn't a lot to distinguish them. I say just watch ""The Hunger Games"" films and be done with it.So what do I like about this film? After all, it's not a bad movie and it's pretty well made. I think the look of this futuristic dystopian Chicago is pretty amazing. I loved seeing huge swaths of the city gone green as well as the drained Lake Michigan--not to mention all of the buildings in serious states of disrepair (though this former part may not be all that different from some parts of the city today). It looked great and gave you a wonderful futuristic look. Apart from this, the script was mildly diverting and it did hold my attention. The acting was generally good. On the negative side, too many times I felt as if I needed Cliff Notes from the book to understand exactly what was happening and several times there seemed to be logical jumps that could only be explained if you assume the characters were reading these as well. I was really annoyed late in the film where the heroine is out on her mission to stop the genocide--with dozens and dozens of killers chasing her. Again and again, she kept stopping...stopping to cry, stopping to catch her breath and just stopping for dramatic effect. Hello?! Folks are chasing after you with guns....KEEP MOVING!!!! Stop stopping!!! Yet, you can only assume she knew that she could save the day so there was no hurry! My overall feeling about this one is that it's good that the film has come and gone from the theaters, as I'd never recommend you pay your $10 to go see this one. However, as a DVD rental, it's about right.","

"Divergent","kosmasp","15 August 2014","Are you the target audience? Are you female, possibly still a teenager? If you answer yes to both questions and will most likely also have read the book (I haven't), than the answer to what you think of this, is likely to be different from mine. Still I watched this with a female friend of mine and she was much ruder than me, when it came to evaluate the movie.It is a different take on the Hunger Games I reckon, though I have no idea what the time-line is on those books. The whole idea about classes and deciding your own fate is the backbone and the one thing that sort of works here. What does not work is the ""love story"", again reducing teenage girls into messes who want to be treated as bad as possible, to fall in love with that ""hard shell, soft heart"" kinda person. It's like the more the guy pushes her off, the more she wants him.We also get the clichés we expect to see. I can recommend the ""Honest Trailer"" to this, just search for it online and you'll find it amusing too, I'm sure. It's what it is, the target audience cannot wait for the sequel(s)","

"Divergent","Coventry","14 January 2019","Okay, apparently the post 2010-world likes dystopian Sci-Fi/Fantasy fables made for, and preferably starring, teenage girls. I realize I'm just an old whiner, but these nowadays dystopian stories are soft and weak compared to the terrific and similarly themed films of the 70s, like ""Soylent Green"" or ""Z.P.G"". What was the typical and almost even logical thing to do for Hollywood producers upon noticing the tremendous success of the adaptation of Suzanne Collins' ""The Hunger Games""? Find more reminiscent novels to turn into massively hyped and over-funded film franchises, of course! Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"", ""Limitless"") chose for the books written by the young author Veronica Roth. The main idea behind ""Divergent"" certainly isn't too bad. In the soulless Chicago of the near future, society is divided into five different factions that each have their own color of clothing to illustrate what type of people they are, like grey for abnegation or blue for erudite. Children are born in the factions of their parents and can remain there for the rest of their lives, or they can choose to move to one of the four other factions at the age of sixteen. There exist psychological tests to help you decide which faction suits you the best, because once you made the choice it's forbidden to change again. When the seemingly ordinary teen Beatrice takes the test, however, the outcome is ""divergent"" and this should be kept secret as divergent people are considered uncontrollable, rebellious and a menace to this formula of a peacefully structured society. Beatrice makes the instinctive but illogical choice to join the Dauntless faction, where she must battle daily to become accepted, becomes infatuated by the hunky but mysterious Four and stumbles upon a conspiracy to re-arrange the factions that looks an awful lot like genocide. As said, ""Divergent"" certainly isn't bad and even qualifies as decent entertainment on a Friday night with a bucket of popcorn and a medium-sized beer, but the script is so frustratingly unsurprising and predictable! The supposedly clever plot twists, like the dark secrets of Four or the mysterious background of Tris' mother Nathalie, are so abundantly obvious that you honestly begin to question the level of intellect of the target audience. There isn't a single thing happening in ""Divergent"" that you can't see coming from three railways stations away and, astonishingly enough, Neil Burger doesn't do anything to put his mark on the film. The action footage is very tame, clearly because the producers wanted to maintain the PG-13 rating no matter what, and the use of special effects or futuristic gimmicks is kept to a minimum, which makes you wonder on what they spent the massive $80 million budget. Perhaps on Kate Winslet's erudite haircut?","

"Divergent","harry_tk_yung","21 March 2014","The opening scene shows a familiar post-apocalyptic city labeled as Chicago, inviting the audience's expectation of Mad-Max-ish fodder. But something does not look quite right – the city is not in complete rabbles, but instead has more than half of the skyscrapers still in good conditions. Then we see people, crowds we expect to see in a normal big city, carrying on with life in orderly, civilized manner. This is made possible, as we are told, because of the wall, which immediately reminds me of ""Warm Bodies"" (2013) in which a similar wall (in nature if not in grandeur) keeps out zombies. What THIS wall keeps out is unknown, even at the end of the movie (at least to those who have not read the books), setting up the scene for future installments.Inside the city we have an orderly post-war world where human beings are divided into 5 factions living in harmony, at least superficially: Abnegation (selfless), Erudite (intelligent), Dauntless (brave), Amity (kind) and Candor (honest). At coming-of-age, protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley), originally from Abnegation, goes through the mandatory character test which helps (but not dictates) which faction to choose. Following the motto ""faction before blood"", once the choice is made, the individual leaves family behind, unless it happens to be in the same faction as chosen. The complication in Tris's case is that the test is inconclusive, marking her as a ""Divergent"", a rare non-conformist considered a danger to the entire community, usually hunted down and exterminated. The kind-hearted test administrator (Maggie Q) suppresses the damning revelation, rendering it possible for Tris to exercise her choice just like everybody else. She opts for Dauntless, leaving her model family of loving parents and brother (who similarly chooses Erudite).The longest sequence of the movie, Tris's painful (in more ways than one) training and ultimate acceptance into Dauntless, is predictability institutionalized. That is not to say that it is incompetently rendered, but just reflects my summary line. Most important, she meets Four (yes, his name and I don't know if there is any connection to Number Four in ""I am Number Four"") (Theo James) the good guy in the pair of good-trainer-bad-trainer, with predictable developments.At 139 minutes, this movie is too long. The two leads are competent, action-adequate and very good to look at. You can't help but wish, however, that Woodley has more material to work with, remembering her Golden Globe nominated role as George Clooney's character's daughter. Two stellar supports, Ashley Judd playing Tris's mother and Kate Winslet playing the ambitious Erudite leader, are welcomed additions but their roles are somewhat lacking in dimensions.I note that just like the various YA adapted movies before it, ""Divergent"" sequel installments are already in pre-production. Although I won't be exactly holding my breath to discover what the wall tries to keep out, I'll probably watch them, if only because they are not in 3D (hopefully).","

"Divergent","heatherderringer","3 July 2014","This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichés from recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a confusing mess. Lead actor Shalene Woodsley does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. Furthermore, the movie is largely devoid of a coherent premise (although, in fairness, there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).*MILD SPOILERS* It's rubbish.*END SPOILERS* Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous dystopian tale, check out the Korean film Snowpiercer (2013).","

"Divergent","iconic-sr","20 September 2014","Brief Overview: Divergent is a movie based off the book by Veronica Roth also titled, ""Divergent."" I am going to start off by saying that I did enjoy this film, but there were a lot of bland moments and plot points that were covered in similar movies.The Positives: One thing that I really enjoyed was how well the movie stayed true to the book, starting with the cast. Shailene Woodley plays the leading role Tris, who is an awkward and remote teenage girl living in a futuristic society divided into factions. Woodley has also in the 2014 release, ""A Fault in Our Stars"" which has been met with positive reviews. She was also scheduled to play Mary Jane in the 2014, ""The Amazing Spider Man 2,"" but her scenes were removed from the final cut (and for Spider Man fans, she may return for the third installment, maybe). What I liked about Shailene's portrayal is that she does do a good job playing a plain personality, and just being plain in general. She was definitely not going to win a beauty contest when this movie was shot (which may be a problem for some), but that is the way she is supposed to be. The book makes important notes that her appearance does not stand out and she is somewhat of an outcast. Moving on to other performances, Theo James plays the role of one of her faction leaders, also known as ""Four."" He also lives up to his novel counterpart by giving the vibe that he lives on a completely different planet with virtually no tolerance. Another positive aspect is the chemistry between Tris and Four which really makes the movie stand out.The Negatives: In many ways, this film feels like a branch off of ""The Hunger Games."" Just watching the scenery, action, and the way the camera is handled gives me some Deja Vu. Also a lot of the character traits for the protagonist are strikingly similar. On a different note, ""Divergent"" lacks the ""explosiveness"" required to keep full attention of the general audience. I just feel that the script was slightly under par and maybe even disappointing for all the potential this franchise has.The Conclusion: I gave this film an overall rating of 7/10. I think this film would be more satisfying if you have previously read the book, but it is by no means a bad movie if you haven't. I recommend this film for most viewers.","

"Divergent","sheilah-953-788608","20 March 2014","To start off this review let me clarify that I have read the books, and read them not long before seeing the movie, so they were very fresh in my mind. There were issues I had with the book, and although I liked the books overall, there were many things that I didn't like about them.This movie I think is an excellent version, as many of the aspects that I found annoying or didn't like from the book are not included, or at least not focused on. To me this made the story that much better.The actors in the movie did a very good job, I found that both leads (Shailene Woodley as Beatrice Prior and Theo James as Four/Tobias) did excellent jobs in their roles. I was initially very hesitant, and didn't want to like them as they were not at all how I pictured the characters, but I am a complete convert. In fact, Theo James did his role so well that I honestly cannot picture that character in any other way except the way he portrayed it. Many of the supporting characters were superb in their small roles as well, Ashley Judd, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q, Jai Courtney, Zoe Kravitz, and Tony Goldwyn, all stood out to me as being excellent in their roles. Some of the other actors I found a bit weak in their parts, but I also realize that might have been because they were not given enough screen time to actually build the nuances of their characters to portray them well.The cinematography and editing I thought was also very well done. I really liked the costume and set designs for this movie, and how well they reflected the factions. From the clothing to their homes, it was all very well thought out on how such a civilization would actually love.The script was also excellent. At no point did I want to role my eyes because it was too silly (which happens a lot with these YA books turned into movies), and it managed to keep you interested in what each character was saying.The story adaptation, again, was also very well done. I cannot think of any part they left out that I felt was absolutely necessary to include, they did very minor story changes, but I also realize that is because to include them would have meant they left an open ended story for viewers who hadn't read the books (which would be very annoying).Overall, I think this is an excellent movie, and I would highly advise anyone who has read the books to go see it, and if you drag your friends who haven't read the books they will enjoy it as well.","

"Divergent","prince_c3","23 March 2014","I usually don't write reviews and on occasion when the movie is really amazing or when movie is really worst, but that movie still end up with above 6 ratings by Critics. So Divergent is one of those movies where producers, directors and production houses instead of spending money and time on script, editing, acting and direction decided to spend all the energy on publicity and promotions. More than 90% of users reviews are negative and still the movie given as 7.7 stars I mean isn't is the biggest proof that producers well paid the critics too. Well, before the movie release they start promoting movie which is the typical case of every big budget movies but they started promoting actress and actor of the movie in every magazine and newspapers, basically they wanted to create a reel life imitating real life scenario between the leading pair the way it happened with Twilight series and because of that, the Twilight series otherwise one of the worse Vampire/Ware-wolf series made lot of money they bank on Kristen and Robert Pattison love chemistry, so the production houses tried to bank on Shailene & Theo chemistry in real life, but it seems that Shailene is not only pretty but she is smart as well, she has lot of potential and she didn't play that game. SO many comments already written about the flaws in the movie I don't think I need to reiterate them here. Overall very disappointing movie in all departments. The only thing is Shailene Woodley and I believe she is promising but still she is no Jennifer Lawrence and I don't think Divergent would become Hunger Games series. Another bad thing about this movie is unlike Twilight series which has low stars ratings which is justified this movie got 7.7 stars rating is ridiculous.","

"Divergent","HaiisamAshraf","27 January 2015","Divergent"" is all about identity—about searching your soul and determining who you are and how you fit in as you emerge from adolescence to adulthood. So it's all too appropriate that the film version of the wildly popular young adult novel struggles a bit to assert itself as it seeks to appeal to the widest possible audience.It's the conundrum so many of these types of books face as they become pop-culture juggernauts and film franchises: which elements to keep to please the fervent fans and which to toss in the name of maintaining a lean, speedy narrative? The ""Harry Potter"" and ""Hunger Games"" movies—which ""Divergent"" resembles in myriad ways—were mostly successful in finding that balance.In bringing the first novel of Veronica Roth's best-selling trilogy to the screen, director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and screenwriters Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor have included key moments and images but tweaked others to streamline the mythology and move the story along. The results can be thrilling but the film as a whole feels simultaneously overlong and emotionally truncated.","

"Divergent","bellino-angelo2014","19 January 2023","I heard for the first time about the DIVERGENT franchise in 2019 but never been interested in seeing them because here on IMDB they have mixed reviews and look like copied from the MAZE RUNNER franchise. But last September I finally saw it because of most of the cast members and while I didn't loved it, I still liked it and found it worth the wait before watching.The movie is set in a dystopian future in Chicago where society is divided in five factions: Abnegation, Dauntless, Amity, Candor and Erudite. The rest, the so-called Factionless have no status or privilege. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) was born in Abnegation and her father Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) serves on the ruling council: Beatrice's test results prove that she is a Divergent, and since Divergents can think independently they are seen as a threat for the social order. So Beatrice joins forces with a group of other Divergents that are in exile and try their best for stopping Jeanine Matthews' (Kate Winslet) conspiracy. She won't succedd but since they made sequels, you can guess what we'll see.The first thing I noticed when the film began was that the sets were so futuristic and unique... not your typical city of the future, that's for sure! There were various stunts that looked a bit like those of the MISSION IMPOSSIBLEs and were cool. The acting was decent, nothing exceptional. Woodley is a very competent lead, same goes for Goldwyn as her dad and for Winslet as the villain, and the others (such as Miles Teller and Jai Courtney) are on par with them. The soundtrack wasn't forgettable but still not that important.Overall, an ok movie that somehow achieved a cult following. I wouldn't put it in that category but more in the category of decent entertainment and nothing more.","

The depth of the characters development is proper. Thus, this movie is also entertaining for adults. I sense good chemistry among the casts. The lead actress successfully portrays a confused yet brave teenager and captures innocence, while the lead actor renders a mature vibe that help save the movie from being categorized as another superficial teenage love story.","

"Divergent","Leofwine_draca","24 January 2016","DIVERGENT is another in a long line of recent Hollywood 'young adult' movies, inevitably based on long-running book series and designed to cash in on the same market as the TWILIGHT saga or the HARRY POTTER franchise. This one's almost exactly the same as THE HUNGER GAMES, featuring a dystopian future world (is there any other type?) split into five different factions. Teenagers must choose a faction in which to live for the rest of their lives.Yes, it's exactly like somebody watched or read the first Harry Potter film/novel, decided that the whole sorting hat thing was a cool motif and that they could write a whole book series with it applied to real life. Unfortunately, that opening plot point is the only thing this film has going for it, as the rest of it is mere set-up. We watch characters interacting, getting to know one another, and training - lots and lots of TRAINING - for over two hours before an action narrative sort of hits in the last half hour.The lack of incident and completely predictability of what's taking place on screen - we've been through all this training stuff before in the first two HUNGER GAMES movies and it was boring then - make DIVERGENT a real chore to sit through. I don't know why these films have to have such lengthy running times and so much exposition when all of the stuff we see could have been depicted in a mere half an hour with a handful of pithy moments instead of endless self-indulgence and stretched-out moments. CGI training sequences are not something I enjoy watching.What I did like about DIVERGENT is that it has decent characterisation for once, much better than in the Jennifer Lawrence franchise. Shailene Woodley is a decent young actress and completely sympathetic in the lead role, and newcomer Theo James makes an impact as her mentor. The supporting cast features the impressive likes of Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, and Tony Goldwyn, alongside more minor bits for Kate Winslet and Maggie Q, and overall the calibre of the acting is strong. It's just a shame that there's no story to go with the characters; I can accept and enjoy well-plotted movies without characterisation, but a film with good characters and no plot is doomed from the outset. We'll see where the sequels go with this...","

When I saw Beautiful Creatures I was so upset because they changed so much! I loved the books but hated the movie. And so did a lot of people apparently, because they aren't making the second one. But with Divergent they followed the book very well! If you didn't read the books you should. If you like The Hunger Games you will like Divergent! The actors did a great job. They really captured the personalities of the characters in the book. The thing that bugged me just a little bit about this movie was that they didn't explore Caleb's (Ansel Elgort) character a little more. He has a sort of big part to play in the books. Other than that I really loved the movie. I have a good feeling they will make the other books into movies too.

The people who complain about it being too slow are just folks who want every movie to be action all the time. The movie has plenty of action, but it also has humor, romance, drama, philosophy, and just general dystopian ingredients. The actors were phenomenal, the music --- well, I for one am getting the sound track, the story is very relevant to our surveillance society, and the pacing of the story and editing was just perfect. Along with Hunger Games, this has to be the best teen dystopian story on screen. I give it a 10, not because I think there were too many negative reviews, but because it frankly deserves a 10.","

They are called erudite, dauntless (athletic militaristic), abnegation (selfless service and government), amity (happy farmers) and candour. Each teen must choose a clan for life. For no apparent reason, the choice cannot be changed. Oddly, even the erudite faction has no educational or training requirements for admission. If the clan eventually rejects them after hazing, they became factionless, similar to homeless in our society.Our heroine goes for a sort of career counselling where they pull out the stops on CGI. It is quite entertaining and mystifying.Unfortunately, our heroine chooses the mindless, loutish, tattooed, militaristic, boorish dauntless faction who do nothing but jump on trains, climb buildings, fight and run in packs.The world is a Republican wet dream where everyone is pitted against each other and the weakest are shamed, deprived and tormented.After a promising start, the movie degenerates into a sort of boot camp army training film. BORING.The whole premise of the movie that having more than one sort of skill is weird and dangerous makes no sense as does the rule you may never change factions.This is a movie for teenagers who fantasise about joining a criminal gang.","

I would have given it a ten, but there were some important things in the book they didn't include. Uriah and Edward were not there. I know they hired an actor for Edward, but his part was so small I didn't even realize he was there. Because of that, the butter knife scene was also not there.

"Divergent","cltyler1","20 March 2014","Divergent is gripping and intelligently brought to life on the big screen from the director who brought us ""Limitless"" and ""The Illusionist."" Are we seeing something of similar essence with the ""Hunger Games"" series? Yes. However, my personal take was that the characters were more engaging and the plot was as well in this film. Shailene is excellent at the helm, and really brings forth a convincing portrayal of a heroine battling in a world where chaos and tragedy envelope the characters. Her graceful emergence from shy personality to dominance is done artfully and really speaks to her ability as an actress. Theo James is also exceptional in the co-pilot role and almost effortlessly seems to pull off the bad boy with standards persona in a manner I haven't seen since Will Smith in his prime. The plot is high octane and especially more gritty than I first imagined. The emotion raw in intensity and empathic build. As a guy who was just going to this film to act as arm candy and a shoulder to lean on for my highly enthused girlfriend, I can write this piece while honestly saying that my eyes were glued to the screen the entirety of the film and was pleased to see this film do such an excellent job at developing both the plot and characters involved in it.

I'm an avid fan of science fiction all the way back to Metropolis to Buck Rogers to Star Trek to Barbarella to Star Wars to Avatar. What makes this series so cool is the social fiction more than the science fiction. Not to downplay cool science fiction threads and special effects along with the stunts but the future's social structure in this premiere of the series is just absolutely brilliant. Many science fiction stories take you on a journey,adventure,exploration beyond our world but I always like social fiction based upon our existing world and what could be. The thing about movies is being taken away to that larger than life essence for a while, Divergent is no exception; except that maybe it does it more exceptional than most movies do.","

"Divergent","gumperman","25 March 2014","When first hearing of this film and seeing the first trailer, I didn't know what to think about it. It didn't excitement me much and all the way up to it's release, I didn't feel it had that same kind of vibe that 'The Hunger Games' had. A vibe that it was a must see film. Then I heard a sample track from the score, composed by Junkie XL. It was great, and it made me want to see the movie a little bit. Well that and I wanted to see if it was actually a great film, like The Hunger Games was. Plus I do like the main star, Shailene Woodley. Well, I just saw it today and here is what I think. The music is great, it has one of those themes that I can't get out of my head and a score I've been listening to since I left the theater. The film itself was a very interesting film, very different from what I understood from the trailer, but I'm not familiar with the story so that is probably the main reason. I really liked the futuristic, post-apocalyptic, dystopian feel that it had going on through it, but it also was kind of scary to think that human life could become that one day. The plot was easy enough to follow, but sometimes confusing. Though, if I had read the book, I'm sure I would understand it 100%. The elements I had trouble remembering were the names of all the factions that people were divided in, or chose to be in, and what those factions' meanings were. When they would show the symbols for each faction, it made sense to me, but the names itself I couldn't quite grasp. I'm sure a second viewing will clear that up, defiantly if that second viewing is on blu-ray and with the captions on. Anyway, other than that, It kept me quite intrigued in a pleasantly unexpected way and I really look forward to next year for the sequel, Insurgent, and the year after that for the concluding film, Allegiant.","

UNTIL it fell flat on the writing and/or directing.Was really into the movie at the start, very intriqued, but sloowly it started to turn into an already seen type of imaginary sci-fi movie with a mix of American teenagers TV-series drama and love. Just annoying. Should had been strictly kept as how it was in the beginning, SERIOUS. (Like star-trek!)Story world like this requires an serious execution, no lala-land love stories!","

"Divergent","zardoz-13","24 March 2014","The immaculate cinematic adaptation of Veronica Roth's futuristic bestseller ""Divergent,"" set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, is neither as gripping nor as gritty as its literary counterpart. I read the first installment of Ms. Roth's trilogy two weeks ago, and adventurous but formulaic best describes its narrative. Interestingly, Summit Entertainment is the same Hollywood studio that regaled us with the ""Twilight"" franchise as well as the ""The Hunger Games"" movies. Based on the $56-million ""Divergent"" coined over its first weekend, Summit has launched its third lucrative franchise. By its second week of release, ""Divergent"" should recoup the remainder of its $85 million production costs before the ""Captain America"" sequel stomps it into obscurity at the box office. Comparably, ""Divergent"" lacks the taboo romance of ""Twilight"" and the pugnacious pluck of ""The Hunger Games."" Happily, it surpasses its closest competitors—the colorless ""Vampire Academy"" and ""Twilight"" novelist Stephanie Meyer's other dead-on-arrival tale ""The Host"" that toplined a similarly feisty female. Chiefly, ""Divergent"" differs because its' government lacks the Draconian nature of its counterpart in ""The Hunger Games."" The fascist government that keeps its boot wedged firmly against the collective neck of Katniss Everdeen, her friends and family in ""The Hunger Games"" is conspicuously absent in ""Divergent."" Our heroine, Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley of ""The Descendants"") isn't like Katniss, and she doesn't define herself with an iconic choice of weapons so much as a lifestyle pursuit. Ultimately, like ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Star Wars,"" Beatrice finds herself cornered in a flawed society that treacherous evildoers want to sabotage through any means at hand. Consequently, ""Divergent"" doesn't have the built-in, ticking time bomb conflict that ""The Hunger Games"" has with a rebellion. Indeed, this predicament isn't far ahead, but at least not in this origins opus. ""Divergent"" incredibly surprising, but its 140 running time won't wear you out.""Limitless"" director Neil Burger and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" writer Evan Daugherty and ""Game of Thrones"" scribe Vanessa Taylor depict a dystopian society that has split itself into factions to prevent any one fraction from gaining the upper hand. Indeed, the unrest that lurks ominously in ""Divergent"" grows out of a conspiracy between wicked members of two fractions. The message, I suppose, is old people aren't entirely trustworthy. Meanwhile, ""Divergent"" opens with a gathering where teenagers can declare the fraction of their choice. At age sixteen, male and females assemble for The Choosing Ceremony. Basically, after a war that ended 100 years ago, the survivors divided themselves into a handful of groups: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. Each group is based on a personality virtue. Abnegation consists of selfless people who place the needs of others before their own. They feed the poor wretches who are not members of a fraction. Amity represents the peaceful people. Candor is made up of those who exalt honesty and truth. Erudite worships intelligence and sagacity. Not surprisingly, Dauntless embraces bravery and reckless impetuosity. Our wallflower protagonist Beatrice hails from a selfless Abnegation family. Abnegates dress in gray and are contemptuously denigrated as 'stiffs.' Andrew (Tony Goldwyn of ""Ghost"") and Natalie (Ashley Judd of ""Kiss the Girls"") are Beatrice's parents. Caleb (Ansel Elgort of ""Carrie"") is Beatrice's brother. Before The Choosing Ceremony, each teen submits to an aptitude test. The results indicate the suitable fraction for them to join. Dauntless member Tori (Maggie Q of the TV series ""Nikita"") exams Beatrice. The rules dictate the test administrator must belong to a different fraction from the one the tested teen comes from. Something goes wrong with Beatrice's test. ""You're different. You don't fit into a category,"" Tori confides in her. "" They can't control you. They call it Divergent. You can't let them find out about you."" Testing divergent is the worst thing that can happen to a teen in this society. No fraction will accept them if the divergent test results are made known. A sympathetic Tori warns Beatrice to conceal her status from everybody, including her parents. Nevertheless, this impediment doesn't stop Beatrice from surprising her mother and father. She joins the Dauntless. She struggles to keep up with these adrenaline junkies. They love to scale the elevate railway platforms and scramble aboard trains as the trains are breezing out of the station. Getting off these trains proves to be even more challenging! The Dauntless expects them to leap off the trains and land on nearby rooftops. Eventually, Beatrice renames herself Tris and braves perils galore during her initiation ritual, including a homicide attempt on her life. Gradually, she evolves from a lowly worm to a self-propelled butterfly with a kick. Along the way, she attracts the eye of one of her superiors, Four (Theo James of ""Underworld: Awakening""), and an amorous relationship develops between the two.Anybody who has read Roth's novel shouldn't be surprised by the textual omissions Burger and his scenarists have deleted some of the more violent scenes. The use of chemicals to test Dauntless faction members, especially with regard to their fears, resembles the missions in ""The Matrix."" Like ""The Matrix,"" ""Divergent"" wrestles with the theme of conformity. Our tenacious heroine learns how to handle herself during boot camp combat. As the finale appears on her horizon, Tris knows more about those she loved that she didn't know. She finds more strength in herself than she thought impossible, too. She enters the Dauntless world as an expendable but emerges triumphant. The scene on the Ferris wheel is cool. Casting is letter perfect. Actress Shailene Woodley was born to play Beatrice. She looks comfortable in the role. Although co-star Theo James appears a little too old as her boyfriend Four, the two generate chemistry and that makes us care about them. ""Titanic's"" Kate Winslet plays the chief villain, and Jai Courtney of ""Live Free: is appropriately sinister as Eric, who ranks above Four in the Dauntless hierarchy. Nothing about ""Divergent"" is remotely offensive, but its strong cast maintains our attention as does its futuristic designs.","

"Divergent","marc5477","27 July 2014","Here are the pivotal problems from my memory after barely watching it once (while playing on my phone): (warning some of these are spoilers)1) When Tris gets the flag it was because the guard was not guarding the only grate leading up to that position. Not science but retarded none the less. Further how the hell did that guard use all her bullets when Tris was the 1st person up the tower? Whatever.2) Three men couldn't push a 100lb girl over a ledge. Whatever. When she is rescued by her boytoy, he didn't bother removing their masks to see who they are when he had all day to do it while they were down.3) Brains can be wiped and reprogrammed with chemicals. No that's not how brain physiology works. If you wipe completely then you would be a vegetable because the only way to do so is to destroy pathways that form action, intent and memory. You cannot wipe a mind by chemical means without wiping it entirely. It might be doable with nano machines but this particular future does not even have guided weapons. Nano tech is beyond their ability. Hell their scientists are actually emotional pansy politicians. Retarded.4) Apparently ""divergence"" is the only way one can be a threat to society. Yea right. Apparently with all the collective knowledge of the science group, this is the conclusion they came up. They actually believe that the most deviant of society are the ones with the greatest intelligence and potential not those with low self esteem, low intelligence, and shallow personalities. But that is too much for them to figure out I guess. Some scientists they are... and you expect them to have nanotech? Its like expect al kaida to invent the 1st sentient AI lol.5) The ending was not as dramatic as the movie made it out to be. Finding a vial on the floor with an applicator is not quick thinking, its obvious and embarrassing (that she and her boy toy didn't figure it out sooner).6) The romance innuendo was unbelievable. Its worse than a Mexican soap. There was no reason whatsoever for that guy to be so overwhelmingly interested in her and willing to risk everything for her. Its like a bad high school drama.7) Actions scenes were worse than comedy action scenes. Bullets seem to go around the main character like a cartoon. Also no one seems to remember how to shoot when engages against her. Also she miraculously becomes an expert shot after being the worst shot during training. They should have just given her throwing knives and have her fly across roof tops like kung fu movies.Retarded movie for low IQ teens.","

"Divergent","ThomasDrufke","21 March 2014","There's a lot to like and there's also a lot to shake your head with this film. For one, it shouldn't be over 2 hours. Its near 140 minutes but a good chunk is spent just watching the same training over and over again. Shailene Woodley was good in the movie, and I also found that I like her love interest Theo James. I thought his character was much more interesting than Peeta and Gail in the Hunger Games Movies. With that said, I know a lot of people really loved this movie, and I respect that. But I just wasn't thrilled with how it played out.Before the negatives there are a few positives that made the film at least an enjoyable watch in theaters. I really thought all the actors fit their role, and I thought each character was written very well. Except for the parents but ill get to that later. Each of Tris' friends once she picks her group were fun. And even the twist with a few of the characters later were interesting and kept me guessing. Miles Teller was funny and delivered a few lines that I got a good chuckle out of. I think its funny how Woodley already has a film with Teller as her love interest and a movie with Caleb (Tris' Brother) as her love interest. The ending turned out to be better than the other 3/4 of the movie.Now onto the negatives, some actors were completely underused in this movie. Kate Winslet (who I expected to have a menacing presence) may have had close to 15 lines in the entire film. Also the parents were given little screen time, and were then just killed off right after each other. The scene with the mom dying was a little emotional sure but I didn't feel connected to these characters due to the few lines and how they randomly show up. The dad's death was poorly handled as well. The music in this movie never seemed to fit. The score that you rarely here was decent (Hans Zimmer). But really all the songs used seemed out of place. I'm never a big fan of any songs that appear in films, much rather stick to the scores. A few scenes the CGI is unbelievably noticeable which shouldn't happen with a big budget film like this one. There were also several CHEESY parts, including a few romance scenes that made me cringe at how awkward they made us feel.Not reading the book, I kinda felt like I was left with several unanswered questions, but perhaps the sequel will address them. I really hope Allegiant is better, and the change of director may help considering Catching Fire was substantially better than the original Hunger Games and they had a change of director. We shall see, but Overall it can be enjoyable with interesting characters and some cool ideas but disappointed with the final product. 6.7/10","

"Divergent","redcarpetrefs","19 March 2014","Divergent is a film adaptation of the novel, written by veronica Roth, that takes place in dystopian Chicago. The society that resides there is split into five groups or ""factions"", each representing different virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, Erudite. On a certain day each year, all youth that are 16 years old take test that determined which faction is the best fit. In the end, no matter what the result, one is free to choose whatever faction they wish to. However, if that faction is different from the one they were raised in, they must leave their families and everything else behind and fully commit to their new role in society.Tris (Shailene Woodley) is one of these 16 year olds to be divided. On testing day she shows equal aptitude for three separate factions, making her ""Divergent"". Confused, Tris is told to keep her results a secret and ends up choosing the Dauntless faction. As Tris deals with the grueling challenges of becoming Dauntless, she discovers that being divergent entails much more than she ever imagined.I think fans of the book will be very pleased with the adaptation. I have not read the books so I made sure to bring a friend, who had, to the screening with me. According to her, the film does a great job at making the book an emotional and entertaining movie without sacrificing major plot points that would otherwise leave fans disappointed. The Tris and Four (Theo James) are well cast. There's nothing particularly outstanding but they are enjoyable to watch. According to my well-read friend, their romance was whittled down significantly for the film, which I think worked out for the better. I really enjoyed how their relationship developed. And while it is a major part, it didn't overshadow the story as a whole.I was really impressed with the music. Being a dance music fan, I think the soundtrack is fun. But the musical score, composed by Junkie XL, is what stood out to me most. There are a handful of very emotional scenes and the music really drives it home.I am a little outside the target age range for this movie but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The obstacles that Tris encounters will translate to audiences of all ages. It's a great story with multiple scenes that led me to reflect on not only my own adolescence but also on my journey as an adult. Out of all young-adult-dystopian novels that have been made into movies, this one is definitely my fave.http://redcarpetrefs.com/2014/03/divergent-review/","

"Divergent","aharmas","21 March 2014","I've decided to go back and give ""Divergent"" a second opportunity so I could appreciate all the great things I had heard about it, its story, action, acting, and how it worked so well that we could expect sequels to let us partake of more of this trio of novels by Roth.After sitting through more than two hours of something that supposedly happens in the not so far future, a dystopian society where the government has decided to divide into four sections, which depend on the citizens' qualities, and because now there's harmony and everything runs smoothly, peace has been achieved, or so we are made to believe.To be fair, there are good things in the movie, and because they are pretty good, it's only appropriate to give credit where it is due. Ms Kate Winslett once again proves to the world the lady can handle just about any acting job you give her. In ""Divergent"" she's the leader of one of the sections, and she looks and acts the part. In fact, she's so convinced she's so perfect for her job, she takes on the job of improving what's already a perfect society, and every time, balance is off, someone is going to suffer. Winslett is cold, efficient, imposing, and pretty good in her ""Divergent"" persona. She's already played aristocrats (""Titanic""), interestingly, she's also given us a chance to witness her talents as a member of the lower classes, too, when she throws caution to the wind and joins Jack in the same film. Even better, she's proved that she can survive in a world where a totalitarian leader takes over, without questioning anything about it (""The Reader""). Here she's nothing else than a very smart and sophisticated cold mass assassin, and she gives us a performance to relish, a performance that shines and stands over the rest because there's very little else in this film to call worthy.And yet, there is Ashley Judd, badly cast as the rebel mother who surprises us with her stealthy moves, as a survival soldier who sacrifices her stability to save her family. She tries really hard with that steely core of hers to give her character substance, but the role is so ludicrous and poorly written that I couldn't help laughing instead of feeling devastated in her big scene. I remembered how much I have loved in much better material.Now, on to ""Divergent""... The material suffers from the lack of originality. We've seen this before in much better guise in more entertaining films, and sadly, the other trio of books and films have come out not long ago. The setting is the future, the masses have been oppressed, and the revolutions have started... Does that sound familiar? In addition to that a few other authors must be wondering why other people just borrow without even trying to hide the fact. At least in the case of Potter, the references were elegant, more of a good tribute, and having those phrases in Latin or something like that, makes the whole experience more palatable. It doesn't hurt that the characters are indeed much better written. One certainly wishes there was more magic in ""Divergent"".In addition to the fact that we are dealing with an unoriginal and paradoxically slow action film, full of noise, a loud and disturbing score that doesn't support but impedes our enjoyment of the muddy photography and the very interesting editing techniques, we have two leads that have absolutely no chemistry and a leading character that seems to believe that strength equals a vacant look. There's no transformation from whatever it is supposed to be at first, insecurity, indecision, confusion, to the hardened, both physically and psychologically scarred heroine. It's problematic because the entire premise rests on this transformation, and as pretty as the lead is, there's definitely not much of a heroic soul here. Anyone can hold an automatic gun and pretend they are a good shoot, but we have no Daniel Craig, Jennifer Lawrence, Scarlett Johansson, or anyone involved in the Marvel Universe here. They're both fictional, too, and much better written, performed and realized.I was having a bit of a problem with the setting of the story. Instead of leading through an hour of training sessions and escapades, and a very confusing testing session, I was hoping that someone would explain that train. Why does it keep running? What's going on with the way this society allows the people that don't to wander around? Why are some places to high tech, looking so futuristic, but we have other residences that could pass for Amish in the way they are portrayed? Someone wasn't really doing much to create a believable universe.I couldn't help comparing this film with another one where people engage in the deception of the masses through entertainment but have to become resourceful in order to survive, and there are flashes of social instability that eventually germinate into chaos and revolution. It does help that there is a more solid script and a main character that shows her flaws, her troubles, her growth, and her steel core with her acting, instead of a narration that well, helps get me confused and distracted me to the point I thought I was narcoleptic. Enter at your own risk. If you see this, you might not need that mind controlling serum after all.","

"Divergent","jpachar82","22 March 2014","The United States of America is not what we once knew – the nation was split and the government was run out by factions – 5 to be exact: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite. With everyone in these factions it was going to be a peaceful world until one day one girl, one test result can change the way our minds can change who we are – Divergent! One faction the Erudite comes in and destroys the peaceful nation by catapulting a ruthless attempt to rid the world of Divergents and the overrule the government so they can get their way with the leadership of one woman – Jeanine Matthews (played beautifully by Kate Winslet.) I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for the people who have not seen the movie but I will say this – this movie was lacking in some places where things were left unsaid, action was left out and things were changed up a bit.This movie was an awesome way of letting dive into a young writers mind of how she sees the world, Veronica Roth who at the time was 23 when she wrote this book. The book was action packed and so was the movie, matter of fact the movie was incredible. The cast ranging from Shailene Woodley to Theo James to the wonderful Ashley Judd and Zoe Kravitz (yes that is Lenny's daughter!) to the villainous Kate Winslet.But the question remains is: Which faction will you choose?

"Divergent","peterp-450-298716","7 August 2014","˝The future belongs to those who know where they belong.˝ ˝Divergent¨.A movie everyone was eagerly looking forward to. A movie a lot of fuss was made about. A movie that was doomed to be a mega-success in the cinemas as ˝Guardians of the Galaxy˝. The only difference with the latter is that the film from Marvel really looks original and refreshing and also has an unique atmosphere. ˝Divergent ˝ is yet another adaptation of a youth book, written by the twenty-five-year-old Veronica Roth, of which one hopes it will make a heap of money just like ˝Twilight˝ and ˝The Hunger Games˝ did. And after wards the merchandising could exploit the youthful fans for years. Admittedly, I had a good feeling about this movie and was wondering how this film would turn out. That good feeling melted away like snow in the sun after roughly 45 minutes. I came to the conclusion that it was just another teen movie, with the same stale story lines and banal trivialities that would make an impression on a young naive public. In other words, again a fragile individual that eventually grows into a heroine and, surprisingly, saves society from being ruined. Sigh. That's indeed for once quite different and terribly innovative.As I mentioned earlier, the first 45 minutes were fascinating. An explanation about the current situation with magnificent images of the ruins of Chicago. I was just wondering why they didn't renovate the existing buildings, since they could construct those ultra modern glass and iron buildings. Or were these half-streaked tower blocks the shelter for those who didn't belong to any class? Whatever. The description of the various factions was pictured nicely. It even went into a socio-political direction at one moment. But soon I couldn't prevent seeing comparison points with the other movies of youth books.However, I fear to say everything that's been said before and I don't think I will reveal any new original angles. Indeed, the system of factions reasonable compares to that in ˝The Hunger Games˝. Katniss became a symbol of liberation and hope in ˝The Hunger Games˝. I suppose that role will also be played by Beatrice (I could be hopelessly wrong since I've never read the books). The ceremony can be compared with that from Harry Potter. The only thing they do not need to do is to put that old talking hat on their head. Just as Melanie, a rebellious teenager, in ˝The Host˝, Beatrice gets hopelessly entangled in a puppy love affair, as expected. Nevertheless there is one positive point. It's by far better than ˝Beautiful Creatures˝ and way better than ˝The Mortar Instruments˝. And if you want to look at a futuristic film, where there is a distinction between certain classes and also has a struggle for freedom, then I suggest you watch ˝Snowpiercer˝. But then however, this movie lacks a bit of real romance and the aggressive and violent level is a bit higher. So it's not for the faint romantic souls.The initial phase where Tris is heading out with the jeering mob of Dauntless, climbing and balancing on bridges while wandering through town and jumping on hurtling trains and after wards jumping back on flat roofs (yes just getting on and off a train at a platform is not challenging for these daredevils) is still enjoyable. Even the tests that they have to endure and the mutual competition that arises is still acceptable. But in the end I thought it was a barbaric and cruel faction that throw out newbies, who ultimately have chosen for them, because they didn't pass the tests. The moment a slight chemistry develops between Four and Tris, it goes downhill for me and it becomes a little too predictable. The ˝Beverly Hills 90210˝ level was reached without any problem with the glitzy, handsome protagonists and feel-good moments. It won't be long and the merchandising machine will be on track and we are bombarded with all sorts of trinkets and gadgets. The next years will once again be filled with Barbie-like stuff, TV programs, PC Games and fashion statements that are related to ˝Divergent¨.Shailene Woodley is perfect for this role and exudes a charisma and fragility. Her ​​future as a teen idol is guaranteed. She will travel the trajectory as a rising star just like Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson did before her. We'll just wait and see if her future performances will be appreciated by moviegoers. Theo James has his looks and that will also guarantee a high melting level for all the the teenage girls looking at him and who will be floating home after wards. His toughness doesn't last long and before you know it he protects Tris as a real mother hen and winds up on the soggy and corny romantic path. Of all the companions of Tris the only one that I can remember is the role of Miles Teller as the terrible enervating Peter. When I look at his performance in ˝The Awkward Moment˝ I'm sure that the irritating quality is a personal trait. Kate Winslet managed again to come across as haughty and disdainful. For the rest it wasn't really an impressive role.Ultimately ˝Divergent˝ is an adolescent story with a disappointing predictable plot. I suppose the sequel, like with ˝The Hunger Games˝, will be a middle film which will contribute even less. So I'm not going to bother to watch it. Despite the sometimes extremely professional elaborate action scenes, it all feels as fake as the applied tattoos.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be","

"Divergent","IrishFrog","22 January 2016","Now here's the thing: I've read the book, which means I started the movie knowing what to expect. So the cheesy plot, the seemingly nonexistent background, everything was already inherent to Divergent in my mind. To me, it was simply part of the concept that the movie would develop, so I didn't find it so horrible. In fact, I even thought it was a good adaptation of the book, but then that could have been because I read it over a year (or maybe even a couple of years) ago. I can't say it was objectively good, though.The romance was awful, there seemed to be no chemistry between the characters in question, they definitely would have been better off as friends. Time seemed to be off too. I mean, I knew quite some time was supposed to have passed between (SPOILER)the choosing ceremony and the final confrontation(/SPOILER), but the director didn't seem to be able to convey the passage of time properly, so hadn't I read the book, I think I'd probably have a sense of timelessness and would see it all as a bunch of things that happened somewhere at some point with some unknown amount of time separating them. Not only weren't characters really unique or remarkable, but also the film lacked emotion and thrill. Most scenes that could have been intense seemed to be left unexplored in detriment of more fight scenes and, seeing as I'm not really a fan of action (or romance, for that matter), I didn't care much about all that violence. Despite all that, I did enjoy myself while watching it. I don't know why. Maybe seeing images I'd only had in my mind be put into something real and concrete made it special to me, maybe I already knew how bad it could be, so whatever good thing came of it was surprising enough... In the end, I'd say this is a movie for you to watch when you don't have much to do and you just want to relax.","

"Divergent","captaincameron","22 March 2014","I always click ""may contain spoilers"" in case I slip, but I try not to offer any. And as i write this review, I should admit that I never got around to finishing the book, so I can't say how true the film was to it. But I can say how true the film was to, well, films in general, and that was this: average. The pacing was poorly assembled. How the world came to be the way that it was was never explained. Why Kate Winslett was in the movie was unfathomable. This may be a spoiler, so stop reading if you wish to avoid such, but when our heroine and others are being trained in hand-to-hand combat, they adopt some sort of weird ""I'm hugging a skinny person to my chest"" stance with their hands and keep their legs almost entirely straight. This is guaranteed to have them get the crap kicked out of them. But the good points: the characters were consistent all the way through. Good point, I guess that was. My advice: Wait for this one to hit the premium channels. More advice: While Divergent was the first in a trilogy, and Hollywood has a way of making a trilogy into four or five or seven movies, don't expect a sequel. This really was that sort of weak.","

"Divergent","elsidaliaj","21 March 2014","I wish I could leave -10 for this AWFUL AWFUL MOVIE. Me and my girlfriend who enjoys all sorts of movies, I'm more picky, walked out on it in the 1st 20 minutes.It was as a 12 year old was playing director for the day. Climax music for a random walking scene, with nothing Epic going on? Check. A police force faction who acted like complete a**holes for no reason? Check. They would run everywhere for no apparent reason, act loud and make noise for no reason. Ohh here is the best part, they would climb up to the overhead subway, again for no reason, and the train would not stop at stops, it would keep going so they needed to jump into it. Wait it gets better, they end up in their headquarters where it looks worst than a run down prison, then next scene they decided to get tattoos, and they are in a swanky upscale lounge with everyone's hair done. LMFAO. That was the point we decided to get up and leave from this complete trash. If you were a fan of the Hunger Games don't get sucked into this movie it's nothing like it, it's the most childish cheesy thing you could ever possibly watch. You have been warned.","

"Divergent","PassPopcorn","31 March 2014","Divergent is yet another bestselling novel I've never heard about, and part of yet another young adult trilogy, by yet another female writer (Veronica Roth) I've, again, never heard about. Also, this is yet another movie I would never have watched, had I not had to write this blog – basically because it looks awful, boring and unoriginal. Before I turn this into a rant against this newest fashion everyone seems to be crazy about, I'll talk about the movie. Divergent is probably best summed up in an anecdote: while trying to point out the difference between The Hunger Games and Divergent, the latter's director Neil Burger started explaining what it was about – and his explanation could have easily been applied to both movies. Ironically, Divergent hails individuality while being a copycat itself.Divergent is set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, where people are divided in five factions, depending on their virtues: the Erudite are smart, the Amity are kind, the Candor honest, the Dauntless brave and the Abnegation selfless. Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) and her family are Abnegation, but she and her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) have to take the aptitude test to determine which faction they truly belong to. Beatrice's results are inconclusive, she's dubbed Divergent and must keep this secret. Eventually, she chooses the Dauntless faction and starts a difficult training after which the weakest ones will be cast out and become factionless – all the while, hiding her true, Divergent nature, as Divergents are being hunt down and killed.Surprisingly, Divergent didn't turn out to be as bad as I thought it would be. It might be because the director is Neil Burger, who also directed Limitless and The Illusionist, which are good movies. Also, the acting isn't bad, although, sometimes, somewhat underwhelming. This applies especially to Kate Winslet, who plays the 'bad girl' in the movie, the Erudite Jeanine – and the fact that she's bad is evident from the first moment she's on screen, just because she's cold and falsely kind. Her character isn't developed any further, she remains irritatingly perfect, as if that was enough to make a good villain. But in this case, the problem is mostly of the screenwriters – and probably the novelist, who created the interesting setting and faction system, but didn't exploit their potential fully or elaborate them enough to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies.As I mentioned before, the movie reminds much of The Hunger Games, but I don't see that as the movie's (or the book's) bad quality. What surprises me is that, after all those silly young adult flicks we've had and still have, people and mostly teenagers are, once again, interested in the same old story – just check out Divergent's box office results. The market is saturated and it's extremely difficult to create a new YA series that will be truly good anymore. Divergent (the movie, but I doubt the book is better, at least story-wise) isn't good: it's predictable, filled with clichés, boring, too long, unoriginal and so on. And still, the book came out and it was a success, and the movie came out and was a success, too – and this will most likely happen to all the other similar novels and movies that will be published in the future. I can only say, if you want to get rich fast, just write a teen love story, with a wannabe social commentary, not set on out planet and/or in our time, and you're guaranteed to succeed.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/","

"Divergent","SnoopyStyle","4 February 2015","In future Chicago, the inhabitants have fenced off the city and split society into five factions. Abnegation is selfless and put in charge of the government. Amity is the cheerfully peaceful farm workers. Candor is honest. Dauntless is the wild brave protector. Erudite is the intelligent scientists. Those who don't belong are forced to live as Factionless. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives as an Abnegation with her family. She is about to choose her lifelong Fraction in the Choosing Ceremony. Tori (Maggie Q) gives her a test and tells her that she's Divergent meaning she has more than one element in her. It's something that must be hidden. She switches Fraction to Dauntless and trained by Four (Theo James). There is a dark scheme underway by Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet).The phrase that keeps coming to my mind is ""I don't buy this world."" Every revelation led me to question the origins of this world. This future world seems weakly drawn. I also don't buy the motivations of Dauntless leadership. I like some of the characters and willing to buy their stories. It's not the best of the young adult friction but it works enough to continue.","

What did they spend $85 million on? There's no special effects whatsoever unless you consider a computer generated landscape of a futuristic Chicago a special effect. The acting is weak. The two main characters are completely miscast for a romance, it's borderline pedophilic. The filmwork feels like it was shot on a vid-cam. I would have walked out about three quarters of the way thru but didn't want to disturb the others in the theater so I just sat there yawning and rolling my eyes. What a stupid movie. I guess with this type of trash appealing to the Twilight slash Hunger Games crowd I should say, Oh mah gawd gag mah with a spoon.","

"Divergent","eddie052010","15 April 2014","Over the past few years, the young adult novel adaptation has become a popular as shown with the box office success of franchises like Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hunger Games. However, despite the million dollar success of the aforementioned franchises, other attempts to create big franchises based on young adult novels, more often than not fall flat on their faces. This is due to either the fact that they aren't unique enough to stand out (and therefore doesn't get the box office popularity it needs to start a franchise) or are flat out rubbish. This is more of the former. While there is some bright sparks that suggest this franchise has more to offer in future installments, the first part is far too safe, predictable and formulaic to justify it's stance as a film that will lead on to a more interesting franchise.The plot of the film is that Beatrice Prior is living in a future-set dystopian Chicago, which is divided into five factions which are based on the various personalities of the people who live there. These are Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (truthful), Erudite (intelligent) and Dauntless (brave). Beatrice Prior, however, is a divergent, a group who are hunted down by the government in order to maintain the peace. In order to hide this, she joins Dauntless, a more militant faction under strict rule. Will she be able to cope by belonging to a single group or will she reveal her divergence.The plot is one of the film's more obvious flaws, seeing as it steals many of its major plot threads from another source. The faction system brings to mind The Hunger Games, but while watching the film you'll start to notice that the film seems to owe more to Philip K. Dick, with much of technology used in the film and the way that the mind is a running theme, seems to have come out from one of his stories. This isn't a huge gripe, seeing as how it is slightly more subtle about it's theft than other franchise starters (Constantine and The Hunger games for instance), but for a film called Divergent, it doesn't seem to be unique enough to truly stand out in order to interest audiences not familiar with the source material.That highlights the major flaw with this movie as a whole: it's far too bland and safe. It's a setup movie at it's worst, something that gladly sets up (some of) the world and characters but is lacking in confidence to truly spread it's wings and soar. The world isn't shown in high detail, the villains here are clearly pawns for a bigger power and on top of this, throughout the majority of the running time, nothing hugely important seems to happen. Sure we find out that the girl here is a divergent and a few major events in her life happen here and there, but for the most part, the movie consists of training segments and montages. Not very exciting stuff is it?It definitely isn't exciting, considering when the action consists of shaky cam, fast editing and close-ups, that ruin the action than make it more intense. It isn't just during the action though, as there are many parts which use gimmicky camera tricks in order to make the movie cooler than it actually is. Casein point, there is a dream section where the camera circles the characters, which could potentially make you feel nauseous.However, there are some good things, that gives this franchise some hope of improving. The acting for the most part is good, even if the main lead is bland, and Kate Winslet is wasted as the villain. The world definitely looks interesting, and the money ($85 million) is clearly on the screen. On top of this, excluding action and certain scenes, the direction is good, and proves that he is great at dramatic set pieces. Despite all of this, the film is clearly lacking in many areas to justify itself as the next big sci-fi franchise.Overall, despite a few high points here and there, the film lacks any punch. Even though things could improve in future entries, the film itself isn't divergent enough (pardon the pun) to stand out and have any staying power as a result.","

The film comes across as a bad TV movie but overlong and is no doubt trying to cash in on hunger games.The plot is dreadful and has more holes that the albert hall, and those silly guns make NERF guns seem lethal. Also Why or why in all bad SF films do characters wear these one piece baby suits with a large belt. Surely in the future they will have more to base their fashion on than Star trek generations!","

"Divergent","grantss","18 April 2015","Inception meets Brave New World, but dumbed down for kids. You could also throw in a few other dystopian/post-apocalyptic movies and books that this is derivative of (not that Inception is such a movie, but the dreams-within-dreams scenes in Divergent reminded me of that).So, derive a plot from these books/movies, then dumb it down for kids. Hero(ine) is a teen. The good guys are the running, jumping, climbing, fighting types, not the intellectuals, or anyone else. (The perpetual running, jumping and climbing actually made the Dauntless people quite comical, rather than heroic, to me. Their whole shtick just seemed so lame). Throw in the usual underdog prevails against the odds and ultimately becomes a hero routine, with a bit of romance and an evil conspiracy by the adults/non-action types and you have your common-or-garden teen action movie. Only positive thing I can say about this is that at least it was better than The Hunger Games (but only marginally so). At least Divergent had some semblance of grit and edginess - Hunger Games is a like a Disney action-movie.","

"Divergent","trepessa","25 December 2014","When I sat down to watch this movie I wasn't sure at first if I would like it but I actually did. I'm not fond of dystopian civilization movies but this one was very good once there was momentum to the storyline. This is a trilogy so the first movie is setting it up for the other two movies or four if they divide the last book into two parts, which has become the standard for a series of books. People need to do a little research before going to see a movie like this. The book was published by Harper/Collins Children's Books, knowing that the novel is geared either for children or young adults. In this case, it was for young adults and that doesn't mean it is to attract fourteen year old teens. People keep bringing up Twilight and this isn't the same type of science fiction story at all. The other is more towards horror and this is not. Besides Twilight was wildly popular and with people of all ages. Those that didn't like the series are in the minority. My daughter was a manager at a movie theater when they were all released and they filled several at each opening and it wasn't all teens.Divergent is a futuristic society that is after some cataclysm which can be natural or a war and in this case it was a war. People ended up divided by nature but some didn't fit into one category and this threatens this particular society. They kept the story in one city and how they resolved what happened to them and not all over the world. The cast was excellent and I saw no problem with the acting. There will be similarities with other stories of this type if they are based on a dystopian society. This one is nothing like the Hunger Games whatsoever. It follows its own storyline which is quite different but after a great cataclysm how the society was functioning. Don't go if you can't deal with the main actors being young. There were many adults in the movie with major parts and covered by very well known actors. This movie was about going through a test and getting placed in a segment of their society although you were free to choose regardless of the results of the test and once chosen that was it for life.I enjoyed this movie and I'm a senior. I don't think there is any age preference to watching movies. The subject matter was very serious and very adult oriented. I await the next segment which if as good will have me watching until the last movie as I did Twilight and Harry Potter. This movie did very well at the box office and the reviews are mixed by professional critics. I am not paying much attention to reviews here who are not professional, because most of them are predictable because this side of science fiction is either you hate it or you love it generally speaking and I didn't love it but I thought it was a good movie and very creative. Even though I have seen dystopian movies in the past this one was inventive on many levels. If you know you don't like this type of movie don't do reviews and compare to every other movie with a young cast. The age of the cast isn't relevant it is the reason for them that is relevant, the place they fill in the society being represented. The movie shows how one got placed into the various societal groups when you reached the appropriate age and what they went through in a few of them by the choices they made. It was rigid and the movie showed how it was falling apart because there was no room for change and growth and rivalries began to form. It's violent like other movies of this type, so be prepared for a less than homey atmosphere in the future society created in this story.","

The writing was poor, inconsistent and very basic it could not compete with other action superhero's movies released in the last couple of years. I gave a 6 because i find the directing and the cast were good, they made the movie stand out. I found Theo one of the best parts in the movie.. I mean lets be honest, they had to choose a good looking actor and make his this perfect to attract audience.","

I have never read the books but going into this film without reading them I didn't know if I would like it. But I was wrong. This movie was Very Good! I love the character of Beatrice, I think she is a great role model for the youth of today which is the main problem with some of these teen flicks today which have very thin leading roles. What surprised me also, is that I recognized the actress who played her. She was the daughter from The Descendants. A very big step up from such a small film.There is also some social commentary in this film. It talks about the effects of living in a world where people have to be the same or else they are thrown onto the streets. Very clever for a teen film.It is very worthy of the IMAX treatment, its a big and bold film that I think is going to be the next best thing in a long time.

The faction day thing seemed interesting, but it dragged on a bit. There's something so boring and bland about the setting and the look to this film. It's just off putting.The characters' are so boring it's ridiculous. It makes it hard to cope with the plot if you cant connect with the characters (robots) themselves.

"Divergent","Hellmant","24 March 2014","'DIVERGENT': Five Stars (Out of Five)Big budget adaptation of the popular youth book about a future world where society is divided into different factions based on people's beliefs and ethics. The hero of the story is a young woman who doesn't fit into any category, so she's labeled a 'divergent', which makes her a threat to government and the accepted conformist way of life. It stars Shailene Woodley as the divergent heroine and co-stars Theo James, Kate Winslet, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Miles Teller, Zoë Kravitz, Tony Goldwyn and Maggie Q. It was directed by Neil Burger and written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor (based on the book by Veronica Roth). I enjoyed it quite a bit and found it to be one of the better youth book film adaptations ever made.The story is set sometime in the future, after a war which divides the remaining civilization into five different factions (that are supposed to represent a person's skills and virtues). There's amity (which are the people who are the most peaceful), abnegation (made up of the selfless), candor (the most honest), erudite (the most intelligent) and dauntless (the world's most brave and fearless). There comes a time when teenagers must make a choice to either stay in the faction they were raised in or pick another. First they take a test which tells them which faction they belong in. Beatrice Prior, who later goes by Tris (Woodley), fails the test and is known by what society calls 'divergent' (due to the fact that she doesn't belong in any faction). Divergent people are seen as a threat to society, since they don't conform, and are killed because of it. Tris joins dauntless and must survive a rigorous testing process, in order to be accepted there, while also keeping her divergent status a secret. At the same time she learns there's a plot by one faction to overthrow another.I really like the setup to this sci-fi tale; it's interesting, complex and very entertaining at the same time. Burger (who won't return for the two planned sequels) and the screenwriters did a great job of bringing this world to life on screen. It's intense and very emotional at times. One of my favorite parts of the film is the performances; I think Woodley is an amazing talent to watch out for and is very impressive as the lead here. Usually the male actors suck in these youth book adaptation flicks but the guys cast in this are actually able to hold their own with the awesome female cast. I thought James looked horrible in the previews but he's not bad in his role at all. I also think Jai Courtney is always interesting to watch and it's funny to see Miles Teller as Woodley's bitter rival (after last seeing those two as lovers in 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW', which was one of the best movies of last year). Winslet, Judd, Q and especially Woodley are all of course outstanding in the female roles and I thought the whole film was just really well put together. I especially liked the main message of the movie; that it's good to be different and an independent thinker (even if you're seen as a threat to the conformist way of life) because being unique is definitely something to look up to. It's great that 'THE HUNGER GAMES' has raised the bar so high for movies like this because now we get much better quality films because of it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UY2UtXfI_w","

"Divergent","jshaw20","22 March 2014","The question everyone who hasn't seen the film, Divergent, wants to know: is Shailene Woodley as effective as Jennifer Lawrence? The difference is in the character development and plot, something neither actress could do anything about.Woodley is as engaging as the rest of the cast that includes Theo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q and Ray Stevenson. Woodley, who looks like she could be Lawrence's sister, was seriously considered for The Hunger Games, and was expected to have the lead in Catching Fire, but Lawrence made it back. Catching Fire has a more decipherable plot than The Hunger Games. Woodley's ""Tris"" in Divergent is as wonderful as Lawrence's character, ""Katniss."" It's easy to love them both.Divergent, a young adult book transferred to film, is as entertaining as any following the dystopian trend that includes The Hunger Games and its sequel, Catching Fire. For adults who enjoyed those films, then Divergent does it one better. Not that The Hunger Games was not a good film; it was done very well. However; the society and logic for the games don't work for all some of us reality-thinking adults.If we were thinking on a broader scale, we might ask a lot of questions if we wanted to, but we don't. These films, including Divergent, based on young adult books, are voyeuristic in that they involve prying observation of ""our own children"" represented on screen. We want to see our children brave, heroic and caring. We'd like them to save the world we messed up. For grown-ups, Divergent and The Hunger Games are still vicarious thrills. We love watching the young win--even it is against others the same age. As long as those hurt or killed are deserving (meaning bad guys) or going to kill the good guys.What makes Divergent different from the rest (and I don't pretend to know all the films made or being made in this vein today) is that the scene is on a larger scale and the young are entry-level to the scene. Their journey is just beginning. Grown-ups have already screwed things up by dividing society by its values. Evil has the usual melodramatic pervasiveness in these films; there is always a villain to make what seems to be a good plan (the world as it is presented to us) even better.That said, Divergent is a decent science fiction film that teaches a lesson to society--or by direct consumption-- teenagers in the world. Teens have questions about who they are or who they should. They questions their actions and reactions constantly. Unlike utopias that portray a perfect world, dystopias portray a world in need. Teenagers, needy or not, can identify with a world in need. The audience or reader sees the distorted world vision, but the characters--the society does not. To be dramatic, most dystopian science fiction we see on film is usually so dark and so grim as to be unrealistic. Most of the world is destroyed by war either among themselves or by aliens.Good science fiction tackles what we should or shouldn't do as a society when it comes to science or technology. And, especially for film, I think it helps to have a positive ending.","

"Divergent","moriah-doyle","4 April 2014","I loved the book, which probably set me up to be disappointed by this movie. To me, it seemed that important parts were missing and random things added. Peter came off as a light hearted jerk instead of a dangerous sociopath and Four just happened to suddenly like Tris. These were important things to develop. Instead, time was taken to have a show down with Janine at the end??? It wasn't just the deviation from the book. I saw this movie with a Divergent-virgin and he asked me multiple times if it was almost over. He felt lost and confused. I understand when movies are changed because the book just doesn't play out but that did not appear to be the case.This was very disappointing and I frankly expected more with Roth being part of the production team.","

"Divergent","ma-cortes","30 December 2018","Thrilling first installment of a successful trilogy, dealing with a stirring dystopian Sci-Fi in which a beautiful and intelligent adolescent becomes involved into lots of dangers, risks, emotion and violence. As Tris, Shailene Woodley, will be forced to make complex choices about sacrifice, loyaly, courage, love
redemption and allegiance. This is a Science Fiction and drama film based on Veronica Roth novel. Sixteen-year-old Tris Prior : Shailene Woodley, lives in a destroyed city of Chicago, in a difficult society divided into factions and, nowadays, she searches answers on the ruins of the town. As each faction represents a diverse way of handling things. Candor are the honest. Erudite are the intelligent, in which her brother, Ansel Elgort, belongs. Abnegation the selfless, in which her parents : Ashley Judd, Tony Goldwyn belong. Amity the kind. And finally Dauntless the brave, in which Tris enlists herself after an extremely dangerous training . The Erudite led by Kate Winslet , have declared war against Abnegation because they think that they have essential information about Divergent. Then the Erudite scheme a massacre against Abnegation. Then, Tris unlocks secrets , uncovering horrible deeds and along with his partners and with the help from others on his side carry out a strong fight against a nasty alliance run by Kate Winslet which threatens to tear their society apart. Tris takes desperate, disturbing choices, and makes difficult decissions to protect the ones she loves, and, finally, discovering the shocking truth.This first part contains thrills , chills , noisy action, high body-count , breathtaking state-of-art-special effects, enough characterization , and violent happenings . Here our starring Tris faces one impossible challenge after another, as she unreveals the truth about her past and, ultimately, the meaning of the strange and mysterious divergence, as well as the dark future on her sad world . The movie relies heavily on the long interrogatory with excessive use of machines, and abstract images on the dreams performed by Tris , as it turns out to be tiring, confusing and a little bit boring. It is followed by Insurgent 2015 by Rober Schewenke in which Tris approaches the residents of Amity led by Octavia Spencer and meet the factionless and Four's, Theo James, mother : Naomi Watts. And finally, the conclusion and unexpected denouement : Allegiant. Stars Shailene Woodley who gives nice acting as the valiant teen who is really haunted by her past, as well as she must confront her inner demons. She is well accompanied by a good support cast to be with her in the three entries, such as : Ray Stevenson, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Zoe Kravitz, Jay Courtney, Mekhi Phifer, Maggie Q, Ben Lloyd Hughes, and Kate Winslet.The picture has a colorful and brilliant cinematography by Alwin Kuchler. And a thrilling and rousing musixal score by Junkie XL. The flick was well directed by Neil Burger, though it results to be overlong and a little bit tiring. However, Neil did not make the second outing, as he couldn't due to scheduling conflicts with postproduction in this Divergent 2014. Burger is a good professional director who has got some successes as cinema as TV. As he has directed notorious films as The illusionist, Limitless, Interview with an assassin, The upside. And TV series and episodes as Billion, Books, the jury TV, The asset TV, among others. Rating : 6, decent Science Fiction movie that will appeal to teenagers. Well worth watching.","

"Divergent","dromasca","7 April 2017","Based on a trilogy of books written by Veronica Roth, Divergent brought to screen by Neil Burger begins as many other similar dystopian films years after the civilization as we know was destroyed by war. One of the surviving pockets is the city of Chicago. In the retro-futuristic ruins that we know from many other films the local community survives by having itself divided into five strict casts, with well defined social roles - agricultural production, justice, social assistance, policing and defense. One has to chose once base on some kind of a hipno-test that detects his abilities and recommends the future path. There is no return. Outfits are thrown out of the system in kind of a homeless world. Those who do not fit into the patterns are feared, and eliminated when identified. They are the Divergents.The film is the story of one of them - a teenage girl who chooses to train to become part of the more exciting military-policing cast - or maybe two if we add her trainer who has one secret in his pocket - as they fight the system, try to adapt, but do not find their way of integrating, so they revolt. The premises are almost as strict as the social rules of the world that is being described in the film, and it would have taken quite a lot of talent and character building in order to overcome a simplistic approach. Unfortunately this is not the case, and the film hesitates between a future vision which is not original enough and a teenage fighting adversity story which is not complex or interesting enough.Director Neil Burger of The Illusionist fame quite disappoints here. I should say that he disappoints again, as after that 2006 movie he never got back to the level of story and characters building that he reached there. He never succeeds to exceed the clichés of the The Hunger Games genre. No, this is not supposed to be a compliment. Divergent is too much resembling many other films of its genre, the young Shailene Woodley and Theo James act well but they are no Jennifer Lawrence and the presence of Kate Winslet in a well built supporting role is not enough to save this film from a very average grade. Divergent is missing some more divergence.","

As the title states, it was the best book-to-movie adaptations yet. It was so accurate and was so honest to the books that it just blew my mind. Ever scene was so true to the books that it amazed me. Of course they had to cut out a few minor scenes for the length but I have never been so proud and happy. It was a really long movie like about 2 hours and 30 minutes give or take and I'm glad it was so long because they had a chance to include everything. The acting was great. Shailene Woodley was pretty great, she really understood Tris and Theo James and her chemistry was really beautiful. I really really liked the movie and I want to go see it again.

"Divergent","gndecastro","24 March 2014","Awesome movie. The movie plays with the theme that society tries to force us into a specific box when we really wish we were free to do many different things with our lives. The story exaggerates this theme by reducing people to five different personality types. Once they reach adulthood, all people are forced to choose and live by one set of rules only. The main character, Tris, does not fit conveniently into any one type so she is considered dangerous because she cannot be controlled. Even though this is being compared to Hunger Games (young people in combat in a dystopian future), it is actually completely different. Only the setting is the same. There were a few minor details that could have been corrected. This is a must watch for any fans of Sci-Fi, action, or even if you just like to see a female in a lead role. Loved it. P.S. - If you have not yet seen the trailer, watch it after the movie. It revealed a bit too much.","

"Divergent","edwardanthony9","20 March 2014","Not quite the quality of The Hunger Games, but still have its own persona and unique setting. The story takes time to find its feet, and while the action sequences was great, the vast number of characters kind of put things in the mix for this decent young adult novel adaptation.The world felt a bit weird and extreme at first, and it takes time before we can finally believe and be immersed in the world. Meanwhile, story-wise was great in the bigger picture, but the first half of the film was all about Dauntless and so it flows in a very narrow scope. Afterwards, the bigger picture is revealed, when we finally realize the significance of ""Divergent"" characters, and the scale of the conflict. That's when the story kind of takes a hard turn and get going for a full blast finale.The vast number of characters makes it hard to follow most of the supporting characters, making things a little confusing, all the while making us less caring for them. Yet, this also means that we can kind of like the main protagonists. With all the different kind of characters, those we want to hate, those we don't care for, leaving us with the main protagonists to like and root for. This is perhaps the reason why we can care for them emotionally, despite the less emotional nature of the unfolding plot. The first half of the film has no drama for us to feel, while in the second, there was too much of drama where we end up getting lost emotionally (in the end, all I care about is the two main protagonists).The visuals were great, and so were the action sequences, supported by a decent soundtrack with some very likable themes as well. The villain of the film was interesting on its own & fresh for a new franchise like this, and the acting by Kate Winslet was also brilliant, but to be frank, they will need a more threatening & challenging villain if they are to up the stakes for the sequels (truthfully, it is well decided in the novels already, but given that I don't read them, I cross my fingers that the next villain will prove more challenging). The twist towards the end is interesting, and quite a nice touch as well. Meanwhile, the ending felt much too abrupt and unfinished, and it just begs of a sequel to come fast.VERDICT:Good: Great visuals & action, Decent soundtrack, Unique setting, Vast array of characters (mixed)Bad: Takes time to find its feet, Abrupt endingSCORE: 7.0(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)","

"Divergent","KineticSeoul","25 July 2015","Watching this movie was like watching ""Twilight"" (except nowhere near as bad), ""The Hunger Games"" (Because of government Totalitarian, ""Harry Potter"" because of the class system and factions, and a bit of ""Inception. Overall this is another teenage romance movie that totally has that written by the mind of a teenage girl that fantasize a lot all over it. But this one is impressive for something that has been written by a girl in her early 20's. I could tell how this story emulates from other stories, but it has enough creativity to make it it's own. Although the ""Inception"" like device that works like something along the lines of the Scarecrow fear gas concept can be a little too much. Even if it plays a big role in the story. So what this movie is, is a sci-fi dystopia romance flick about couple of teens standing up and rebelling against a over controlling government. So yeah, the premise has been done before. Especially in certain animes. This movie is directed pretty well and the cinematography is decent for a movie such as this. But I actually liked the message behind this movie, which revolves around choosing your own path and not be fearful of what others think of you. That your life is your own and others should not play a part in controlling or manipulating you. Overall, this movie was alright. I thought it was a okay watch and I don't mind seeing the sequel ""Insurgent"".6.7/10","

Divergent's totally, starry-eyed, little tale of the future was conveniently twisted into yet another full-blown Romeo & Juliet story where, this time around, teenage jocks (both male & female) plunged head-long into serious training to become the coveted ""Dauntless Ones"".And was I at all surprised to find out that Divergent's futuristic society was, once again, a nation that blindly preached peace through total threat and enforcement of violence?.... No. I was not surprised. Not in the least.If you ask me this utterly pretentious, $85 million production was just another version of ""The Host"", but, of course, this time it was all done on a much grander scale, with definite shades of ""Starship Troopers"" thrown in for good measure.At 2 hours and 20 minutes, Divergent really pushed the limits when it came to being tolerable entertainment. In general, I thought that most of the cookie-cutter characters in the story were just a bunch of shallow, two-faced, arrogant snots and I couldn't have given a sweet-damn whether they ever triumphed in their goody-goody, little mission, or not.All-in-all - Divergent was nothing but superficial fluff marketed exclusively for a very gullible, non-thinking audience.","

But this movie appears to be nothing else but another attempt to corrupt naive girls and boys into the ""You are the chosen one"" story-type. In every single second I could feel how much this movie tried to be the next Harry Potter ripoff, just like Hunger Games did it. Juveniles get categorized into dumb superficial ""fractions"" like HP did it with Slytherin, Griffyndor etc. to address the teenage-viewers desire for belonging to a team and having a clear enemy, there's one of the most predictable and unsophisticated romance-story lines involved I've ever seen, the whole set and the actors make one feel like watching a low-budget production, there is so few thought and logic behind this movie, that the constant super-serious atmosphere just makes it even more of a second hand embarrassment. When I left the theater with my father I quickly tried to change the topic to avoid mocking around.

"Divergent","filipemanuelneto","14 February 2021","After the resounding success of ""Hunger Games"", American studios were hungry for more films and trilogies for young adults. ""Maze Runner"" and ""Divergent"" were two of the most evident, with scripts and source material that, in everything, remind us of ""Hunger Games"". In this film, the beginning of another trilogy, we are presented with a dystopian future: the human race faced the Third World War and almost died out.In order to regain peace, the survivors grouped in the city of Chicago and created factions, in which they engaged according to their vocation: Erudite grouped intellectuals, teachers and scientists; Amity did the same with farmers, manufacturers, artisans and traders; Candor includes magistrates, lawyers, bailiffs and lawmakers; Dauntless welcomed the police and military; the Abnegation brought together civil servants, doctors, nurses, social workers and all those who dedicate their lives to helping others. By their characteristics, they are also the political leaders. The faction is chosen in adolescence, after a vocational test that should help, or even indicate, to which faction you belong. There are also those who have no faction or have left theirs, and who live in misery. In a system where the faction is more relevant than family, being without a faction is being excluded from society.The young protagonist is Beatrice, or Tris, whom the vocation test indicated belonging to more than one faction, that is, being a Divergent, a serious threat to the faction system. Choosing to join the Dauntless, she will face serious difficulties to integrate and pass the tests presented to her. To make matters worse, her father, who is one of the leaders of the Abnegation, is being questioned by the strength of the Erudite, led by the cruel Jeannine, eager to rise to power, albeit by violence.I really liked the movie, overall. At the time it was released I felt it went quite unnoticed, overshadowed especially by ""Maze Runner"". Now that some years have passed and the success of the competitors has faded, it was interesting to see this film, I felt that I could appreciate it better and that the film has aged well until now. The story is good, it holds us to the end, and it develops in an engaging way.The cast is quite good and competent at what they should do. I especially liked Shailene Woodley, who I didn't know until I saw her here. She is good at what she does, she has talent and, on a more personal note, she is identical to an old flame of mine, which is almost the same age as her, and that of course made me remember my own past. Theo James was also excellent, particularly in the action scenes, where he seems cut out for the role. Miles Teller is just as good, especially considering that his character is hateful. Equally worthy of our hatred is the character of Jai Courtney, who is very good at the task of being rude, brutish and somewhat sadistic. Kate Winslet is cold and insensitive, and in fact she performed very well, but I don't know if I would bet on her as the first choice for the character. The film also features Zoe Kravitz, Ansel Elgort and Ashley Judd.Technically, the film is visually impressive. The cinematography is excellent, vibrant and sharp, and I loved the landscapes of a half-destroyed and decadent Chicago, of dry rivers and lakes, and devastated buildings. Incredible, but not coherent: if the entire human population was there, wouldn't more space be needed? Why not rebuild all? Didn't they have two hundred years of peace to do so? Another thing I liked and found amazing was the action and fighting sequences. Really well executed. I also liked to see Intrepid climb buildings with ease ... in a city that is famous for its strong winds (another logic problem that can only be forgiven for being less relevant). The sets and costumes were very well done and the soundtrack also fits into the overall set.","

"Divergent","Fashionatic","3 February 2015","I didn't watch this when it came out in movie theaters because I thought the preview looked stupid and basic. I was partially right. It is a basic form of a dystopia fighting to become a utopia. It is very similar to the hunger games which is why I dropped from 10 to 9 in ratings. Other than it being too similar to the hunger games, it was a good movie. I was not expecting both of Tris' parents to die. I did wish Tris and Four had more scenes together. Maybe in their new series they will explore their relationship further. I was not a fan of how it ended. Tris and Four just left the dystopia with all the leaders still alive. Obviously, they will come back for revenge. Overall, I can watch it over and over again because they picked a very good cast. I also underestimated Shailene. I use to watch her ""secret life"" show on ABC family, so I was expecting her to be an over dramatic character. She played this part well.","

"Divergent","The-Sarkologist","12 April 2014","I'm not really sure about this movie because it seemed to be a little rushed, especially at the end. In fact it seemed to be one of those movies where a young person joins the army, spends three quarters of the movie doing basic training, and then the last quarter of the movie going out and saving the world – the only difference is that this movie is set far in the future after a major war where society has split into five interdependent clans that are each based upon a virtue (bravery, honesty, compassion, etc) and that once one joins a clan (based on a ceremony at the age of 16) then one cannot step out of the clan into another clan. The people are also tested to see which clan they best suit, however during that testing it can come out that one does not necessarily fit into a single clan, making them divergent.To be honest with you I could not really see how the idea of the divergent being dangerous was and why they needed to kill them. In fact the whole concept didn't really work all that well for me. It wasn't a bad movie, if in a way you don't mind a bit of action, but on the whole it didn't seem to make all that much sense, with the whole section involving the training and then the attempted coup at the end. This further added problems to the whole concept, namely that if the system had been set up to prevent conflict in the future, then why was it that, all of a sudden, a conflict arose in the form of an attempted coup. It seemed that, on the basis of the plot of the movie, that the whole system has essentially failed.There is also some Christian themes in the movie, which have come about from the author's statements that she is a Christian, and when one looks at it one can see right-wing Christian ideas coming out of this book. Basically it represents the ongoing conflict between the extreme church (as represented by Abnegation) and the extreme scientific community (as represented by Erudite) however, it also comes down in how you perceive the nature of the story, because Abnegation can also represent that aspect of society that supports the planned, egalitarian society, while the Erudite supports a free-market, might means right, form of society, and we see these aspects within the warrior caste, where those that don't make the grade are cast out and become factionless, and then the apparent coup against the ruling faction on the grounds that they horde the food, and hand it out to those who do not work for it.","

"Divergent","adamjohns-42575","16 August 2021","There is a definite hunger games vibe to this film. Not just in the storyline, but even in the way and the style that it is filmed. I do wonder, however, whether it might not have been better received it had been released first?I don't personally think that Shailene Woodley was the best choice as the lead, although I haven't read the books yet to say that she isn't a good version of the author's character.Theo James is not only handsome, but he plays his part well and although he's annoying, so does Miles Teller. I think that perhaps if the film hadn't been so rushed, we would have seen more of them both. Having said that, I did struggle to tell some of the male characters apart.There are times when I found the violence to be a bit much. I will never understand why some military branches feel the need to beat the strength out of people. Everyone has a place, it might just be admin or Medicine instead of fighting.It's not a bad story, it's just one we already know. It's a shame that there are so many of a similar ilk out there now. They may have all shined individually if they hadn't all come at once, but it's fairly obvious what will happen, because in one way or another, we've seen it all before.I have to say though, that I think this is Kate Winslet's best performance yet.","

"Divergent","billygoat1071","21 March 2014","Divergent has recently been called the next big thing. People are expecting this series to match with Harry Potter and mostly The Hunger Games. It could be just another one of those dystopian future tales that revolts against a tyrannical government, but the concept sounds a little transcendent that can somehow relate to the young adult readers. But the story itself is lacking a definite center, forcing the action to come out when it needed to without any slow burn at the ticking bomb. It's almost like any of the genre's generic films: exposition over substance. Though the exposition here is at least more than great visuals, it manages to make it all exciting despite that it generally isn't. Divergent is competent in filmmaking, but mediocre on themes.The films has a decent way to introduce the world and it truly is intriguing to explore the surfaces. It's so intriguing, the actual storytelling ends up being contrived without any growth. The threat just suddenly distracts the nearly endless exposition, but what really suffers is the subtext. The film doesn't seem to be interested in snagging its thematic potential, all what this narrative is capable of is innovating. This is a common problem to the YA genre, apparently, and the momentum and conflict once again just pops up out of nowhere.This underwhelming storytelling is thankfully carried by a more fascinating and delicious vision. Neil Burger creates it into larger-than-life, and they are much entertaining than what the script tries to deliver. Everything just moves briskly and makes sure that it doesn't miss a satisfying thrill. The coolest scenes are proof that these filmmakers have big ambition to the project and yet the narrative fails to justify it. The cast has also done well. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are competent enough as the heroes, and Kate Winslet somewhat elevated her villainous character.Divergent could be like one of those vapid YA's such as Beautiful Creatures, Mortal Instruments, or whatever. Except this one is probably the best among since it has a craft that at least made it watchable. But then the meat is not well defined. It's frustrating because the ideas are just right there on display and you don't know where the potentials have gone. The bright side is there are more cool sequences, like the zipline ride and the wannabe parkour from a train (with the Woodkid soundtrack), than mouth sucking subplots that the genre has been iterated in years, we could use more of that. But there are bigger things to complain here, there really seems to be something far more compelling beneath the concept. So for now, we at least get a movie that has better focus to intrigue our imaginations and not teenage hormones.","

It's no ""Hunger Games,"" but director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and writers Evan Daugherty (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") and Vanessa Taylor (""Game of Thrones"") do a respectable job bringing the Veronica Roth novel to life with maturity and actual filmmaking talent.Having read the book, it's kind of in the same boat. It's not as good as the first ""Hunger Games"" book but it has that same adult, ultra-violent tone with romantic subplots that don't overtake the plot but rank a clear second to it. The dystopian world of ""Divergent"" is far more complicated than ""Hunger Games,"" which widens in scope as the trilogy continues instead of turning the whole world it has built on its head in book one as ""Divergent"" does. Essentially, ""Divergent"" the movie is as good as the material allows it to be, meaning its faults run as deep as those of its source material.That said, ""Divergent"" is an intriguing and engaging story, even if it feels unpolished at times. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) is a teen living in one of society's five factions in dystopian Chicago. She has reached the age when young people are tested to find out which faction (all of which are based on different virtues) they are best suited to, though in the end they are given a choice no matter what the results say. When Beatrice takes the test, her results are inconclusive. This means she's divergent; she doesn't belong in just one faction, and in a world where everyone is supposed to fit in a specific place, this is dangerous. She chooses to leave her selfless faction, Abnegation, for the bravery and free-spiritedness of Dauntless.Woodley's talent and career trajectory suggests that Summit Entertainment was going for the next Jennifer Lawrence-type to play Tris and she's as good as it gets. With the book being told from the Tris' perspective, it's incumbent on her to communicate the many feelings that Roth so excellently expresses in the book and she does. The rest of the cast isn't too bad either, though only Theo James as Four, Tris' Dauntless mentor-turned-love interest, gets much of a platform. He's every bit of mysterious, dark and handsome as the part necessitates.""Divergent"" sacrifices these side characters in the name of bringing all the memorable plot points of the story to life and explaining Roth's highly intricate dystopian world. There's nothing simple about the faction system for those who haven't read the books, so it eats up some screen time. And with so many scenes and moving pieces, there's little breathing room in the screenplay. The other initiates that Tris befriends (or tangles with) in Dauntless who keep the story grounded in a lot of ways don't develop in the film so that parts including Tris' experiences in the fear simulations, the capture the flag scene and more can all have space in the final cut. ""The Hunger Games"" took a similar philosophy, to let the main character be the real emotional focus of the film and to shut others out, but again, ""Divergent"" is more complicated, and the story doesn't have emotional turning points in the same way ""Hunger Games"" does.Artistically, however, the adaptation does a nice job, even if it borrows on the ""Hunger Games"" aesthetic a little. Burger nails the test and fear simulation scenes, in which Tris experiences a lifelike simulation induced by a serum. He gives them the eerie, larger-than-life quality they require but in a natural way that outdoes the average film's creepy nightmare sequence. The adrenaline rush of Tris' dauntless adventures also comes through. Speaking as a Chicagoan, it would have been nice to see more of the city's actual aesthetic in the film, which is essential to this series, but there's more potential for that in the sequels.So many young adult novel adaptations have been made, and maybe barely 10 percent manage to become ""Twilight"" or ""The Hunger Games."" It isn't and won't become those (even though it's better than ""Twilight""), but ""Divergent"" proves there is room for a successful middle ground in this genre, something it desperately needed.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

"Divergent","vgale-31-601397","8 April 2014","**May contain spoilers** My partner god bless her loves these books and seeing it was part of her birthday week I relented and went with her to see it. To be honest from what little she had told me (or I had forgotten) this would be one of those ""chalk up the brownie points and suffer through deals"".I'll try not to knock the book as I haven't read it but from what I've seen in this movie and from the reaction of my partner, I may just have to read it to see how this went so terribly wrong from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the books and the perspective of someone who has.First: Where was the lead in? not sure why there was a war or who it was against? but that may help the audience understand the concept of the factions or the actual reason for the story.Secondly: Where was the character development or more so the relationship between them, I mean the deaths of the parents in this movie meant less to me than any other movie I've seen, I felt nothing and geeze... you could see it coming from a mile away. The father just threw his life away when they could of easily taken out the 5 or so guys in the room, especially with a number of them having their backs turned, let's not mention he walks into the middle of a hallway with no cover...And more: So they have to face their fears in the simulation but when they both go in Four doesn't seem afraid bar some sarcastic comments.Conclusion: Unless you're some fanatical fan I can't see how you could enjoy this movie, this was cringe worthy at best. If it hadn't been for my partners birthday I would of walked out and I'm still upset I didn't... and trust me.. my partner was probably more upset about this steaming pile than I am and she's an avid fan of the books.","

"Divergent","mh-hirschfield","9 July 2015","I had heard nothing about this movie before I began to watch it. After seeing the first 10 minutes, I can confidently say that I could predict the mind numbing 6 plus hours remaining in the trilogy. There are so many things wrong with this (recurring) movie adapted from the same model based on books with the same recurring story (characters, themes, etc.).This laughable new genre of Teen Trilogies are todays version of the Mad-Libs books from my grade school days... except they are unable to turn the page to another storyline, are restricted to the same repetitive word bank and only able to exhibit originality through the cool first names assigned to the leading female protagonist.The next Trilogy should be centered on a young author who discovers that all books are now only written by huge corporations aimed at maximizing profits (through follow up movies, documentaries, theme parks and related products) and how he/she plans on burning the whole boring system to the ground.","

"Divergent","drqshadow-reviews","5 August 2014","With the flood of teen lit-inspired movies on the scene today, it can be all-too easy to unfairly shuffle them all under the same leaky roof. Often, that short-sells the more gleaming examples of the genre. Not so with Divergent, a ruthlessly narrow little bit of phony escapism that confirms every ugly stereotype. Dim and wooden, it's a thoroughly hand-holding bit of tack that can't seem to get over how breathlessly important it thinks it is. The generic core storyline has nothing to offer, over-familiar and rich with the scent of manufactured drama. Its cast, thin and transparent as they come, spends most of the bloated runtime reveling in their own majesty at the expense of actual character development. Not that the actors seem capable of exploring any such depth, were they given the material to work with. Shailene Woodley and Theo James, beautiful people without so much as a single spark between them, seem to have been chosen exclusively for their pouty appearances on the promotional materials. Likewise, an awkwardly mismatched sparkle-pop soundtrack stands at odds with the bleak, dystopian tones that the plot stretches for. At least the visual effects are well done, for what that's worth. It's a real waste of time and effort, an insulting vehicle to cash-in on the latest craze and promote a few of the parent company's tunes while they're at it. I wish I could get my two hours back.","

"Divergent","MrILoveTheAnts","22 March 2014","""Die A Virgin"" is the story of a girl trying to find her place in the world. But the factions want her dead for some reason or other, I think it's because she's can lucid dream while doing acid. It's not very well explained.For $80,000+ million dollars this movie actually looks really good. It's a nice semi-original looking world, like a mix of ""I Am Legend,"" with ""Aeon Flux."" All of the exterior shots were great, but interiors really needed some work. I don't think they could afford chairs or feature really. There's a lot of people in mono-colored rooms all wearing the same colored cloths. All the guns, whether they're the training guns, the real guns, or the future guns, all make the same fake zappy sound effect that make people just want to lay on the ground regardless of where they got shot. This removes the emotional impact to the audience has when someone actually gets shot so when people die it's like nothing happened at all. Actually the lead girl gets shot in the leg in one scene and is up and about running in the next. The hand to hand combat is nice but then there are these flat shootouts where people are just hiding behind cover, shooting at one another. These shootouts lack the creativity of a good action movie.Her parents are throw away characters who show up for these bland shoot outs and ...*** Spoilers *** ... die almost immediately. Shailene Woodley is a decent lead and does a good job of acting when her mother dies, but because this is just a women that might as well just have a name tag that says ""MOM"" on it, I just didn't care. They needed a tender moment or two to establish what this women actually meant to Tris, a little thing she did as a child, or something with her hair, a saying or something that becomes her last words, Something! She has a tattoo I think so that's something but not exactly the same as being the women who put a flower in her hair when she was young. It doesn't help that she's wearing gray for the entire movie either! They're just bland characters that get shot and I really think it's just to spice up these shootouts? So the end of the movie happens and they kill all the people in the room except for Kate Winslet's character. And they forget to kill her on the way out, I'm guessing because they need to make two squeals out of this piece of crap. This is the women who basically started a war and orchestrated the mass genocide of Tris's family and faction. I really wished this movie had the balls to have Tris grab her by the hair, drag her out into the street, and effing execute her for her crimes against humanity... but nope, we have to complete this lack luster 90 minute love story between Tris and Four. She has to say things like ""Both my parents died today,"" apparently without any tears coming out of her eyes either! They have to flee the city on this run away train no one seems to be driving for some reason or other too.","

"Divergent","mattkratz","17 April 2017","This wasn't too bad a movie. Let's see if you find yourself drawing comparisons to The Hunger Games. A dystopian future (how many of those have we seen?) set in Chicago, where life is divided into 5 sanctions, and Tris's ""test"" in inconclusive and she winds up choosing the ""dauntless"" sanction and surviving a rather brutal militaristic set of tests to get in. It turns out her mother went thru the same thing.The movie features decent action scenes and good performances as well as some good scenes where they try to ""scare"" the people trying to get into dauntless. I like the latter scenes. This is basically a movie about fitting in. Based on the other reviews, you will either love it or hate it. The cast worked well together.** 1/2 out of ****","

"Divergent","BrentHankins","20 March 2014","Big budget adaptations of popular young adult novels have become the latest trend in Hollywood, with each major studio hoping to create the next Twilight or Hunger Games phenomenon. While many of these quick cash-in attempts have resulted in embarrassingly low box office returns, Summit Entertainment's Divergent, based on the bestselling novel by Veronica Roth, could very well be the proverbial ""next big thing.""In the future, society has been divided into five factions, each with a defining personality trait and a specific social role to fulfill. At the age of sixteen, each member submits to an aptitude test designed to guide them into choosing a permanent faction, but Tris (Shailene Woodley) is shocked to learn that she is ""divergent,"" showing equal aptitude for more than one faction. Not only is Divergence rare, but many consider it to be a dangerous condition that could threaten the delicate societal balance, and Divergents are routinely met with ""accidents"" that leave them in a body bag.In order to distance herself from her family members and keep them from discovering her secret, Tris elects to join the Dauntless faction, an elite group of warriors tasked with defending the city. But Dauntless training is more than she bargained for, with a hostile fellow recruit (Miles Teller) garnering an obscene amount of pleasure from pummeling her in the combat ring while faction leader Eric (Jai Courtney) nods his approval. She finds comfort and solace in Four (Theo James), who seems to understand much more about her than she chooses to reveal, and who might be her only hope for salvation.Divergent spends a hefty amount of time building its world and establishing its characters, and despite stilted dialogue that finds itself in dire need of a punch-up, the relationships still feel genuine and relatable. Woodley and James have palpable chemistry, while Teller and Courtney play their villainous roles with gleeful abandon. Kate Winslet also has an enjoyable turn as a sinister government official whose interactions with Woodley are chill-inducing - expect her to play a major role in the eventual sequel.Divergent is at its best when the action finally gets rolling, which admittedly takes awhile due to the colossal amount of exposition required. Woodley never quite looks comfortable throwing punches and wielding weaponry, but her talent and charisma do a nice job of balancing the scales, and she carries the film admirably. By the time the credits roll, audiences should be entranced by Tris and eager to follow her along to the next step of her adventure.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com","

This movie is BORING, predictable, cliché, poorly acted, overly girlie, nonsensical, and the plot line is paper thin. I felt as if I was watching a project put together by high-school kids, who just happened to have a decent budget. There isn't a speck of creativity or intelligence in this piece of crap.

What group of citizens would ever tolerate any such nonsensical arrangement? None! That's why it's never happened and never will happen! These stories exploit adolescent insecurities, mostly of females. They suck in immature minds into identifying with the main character as some kind of hero for resisting trends in a purely illusory social situation. They are moronic and worthless! Total garbage!","

"Divergent","ifeedmedia","10 April 2014","I went to see this movie and i must say this is a special kind of horrible. Not one of the subplots made any since and most of the characters accept the leads were poorly introduced. They set up divergence as if it is a special ability but its not. Its just a tittle. The main character Trice never really comes off with anything that looks like a special ability. The fact that there are no contrasting examples of her special ability make her ability hard to see. She just a girl falling in love. The movie is slow as molasses and until you get to say 45mins into the movie you want to fall asleep. The plots are all incomplete and at the end you have no summary of what just happened.The society they set up in the movie is not realistic in anyway. The Dauntlets are basically a group of wild side party teens and they act like they are tough when none of then really show a capacity to fight or defend. Though the story sets them up as the defender or police of this world.There are pointless scenes like a zip-line scene that seems to come out of no where and have no relevance to the plot or the development of their NON-hero Hero. The movie is like a mesh of other films like, they use the color look of Twilight and try to set the 2 main character up in the same romantic way. The world reminds you much of The Hunger Games but has much much less action and much less relevance. There is even has a touch of Matrix to it accept with all that technology they had no gun that could fire in rapid succession. Everyone in the movie pulled guns and most of the time they did not shoot. Nothing is cohesive in this movie and I would rather you go see a re-airing of Spanglish, Tremors or Judge Dred if you want to see a much better movie. I am a guy so maybe this movie was made for ladies more than men but I really did not like this fragmented, inconclusive, cheesy movie. Any 4 year film student could have made it.","

It's so bad that we broke into laughter at some of the silly, stereotypical dialog and predictable plot elements. Kate Winslet walks through her part as though she'd been blackmailed into appearing. Kafka it is not. Not even close. It is obviously derivative of Hunger Games and does not even pretend to be the morality play or political satire that some seem to think it represents. The closest it comes to a ""genre"" is a Hong Kong martial arts film, but most of those are better. None of the characters act or react like real people. It's not good science fiction, not good fiction of any other kind.","

"Divergent","Rob_Taylor","14 August 2014","So, it seems these days that the word 'dystopia' has come to mean 'any old nonsense society we can think of regardless of how impractical or unbelievable it is.' Snowpiercer, The Hunger Games, Total Recall (the remake) and so on, all share this common belief that any crazy society makes a viable setting just so long as you can gloss over the many, many cracks that even a moment's examination will discover.Divergent is just a variation of The Hunger Games, when it boils down to it, with teens being forced to do dumb things for the sake of the society. There are five factions, but the only one that would probably be of any interest to, you know, an actual teenager, is the slightly demented Dauntless clan. They run, they leap, they do dumb things, and all just because they can. They are essentially painted as the 'fun' faction and it is hard to imagine, given their rivals, that any teen would pick anything else at choosing time.Hmmm. Let's see... Farmer, Doctor, Lawyer, or Dogsbody. Or I could be a leaping, fun-getting Dauntless! Such a choice...There is also the nonsensical 'test' that all teens must take, but the results of which are generally pointless, since the teen can pick any faction at the time of choosing. Yet everyone gets all worked up about the test anyway, like it actual has a point.All of the usual teen concerns are on offer here, but it is hard to take any of it even remotely seriously. It's just so ham-fisted in its delivery of all these teen issues that it invites derision for the most part.Acting-wise, all is fair, though no one shines. Almost all of the population appear to be teens, though, with a handful of adults around to spoil the fun and almost no small children at all, which seemed odd.The main heroine goes through the motions of trying to fit in and failing, all the while falling hopelessly in love with her much older instructor. One begins to wonder if the writer had a crush on one of her teachers that went unfulfilled in her youth.All in all, an overlong exercise in endurance with a daft societal premise that just plain sets itself up for ridicule.SUMMARY: Too long, Too derivative. Only worth it if you are a teenage girl who doesn't get out much.","

"Divergent","nina_xue","10 April 2014","For those who haven't read the Divergent series by Veronica Roth, you might be wondering about all the similarities between this film and The Hunger Games – both set in a dystopian future with a very powerful 'state' controlling every aspect of life, society divided up into a number of classes and a fearless lead female who's willing to fight and take on the State. Well, you would have wondered right. But having said that, The Hunger Games turned into a massive box office success for a reason and if it ain't broke don't fix it right?I found the concept quite fascinating – society is divided into 5 different factions based on their personality traits. But, as expected with teenage fiction, it was a little too oversimplified for my liking. Another issue I had with the faction system was the overlap between Abnegation and Amity, as they both value kindness, peacefulness and forgiveness as their core life principles. So isn't Amity just a less extreme version of Abnegation, disguised as a bunch of barefoot hippies?But much in the way that The Hunger Games made us all wish we were the archery- extraordinaire brave enough to volunteer ourselves as tribute to save our doe-eyed younger sister alongside the boy who threw bread at us, there are also many qualities that are admirable in Tris. Perhaps a major difference between her and Katniss was the fact that Tris rejected the selfless values she was brought up with in favour of her true identity as Dauntless. At the heart of the film is a story about identity and having the courage to stay true to yourself. In that sense, while almost everyone could relate to the bravery and sacrifice in The Hunger Games, Divergent is targeted at a slightly younger age group.All in all, this was an entertaining film but don't try to read too much into the story. Staying quite true to the novel (although not as closely as The Hunger Games), the film in my opinion even improves on some aspects of the book. For example the final confrontation between Tris and Jeanine (Kate Winslet) flowed more smoothly than the scenes described in the novel.Shailene Woodley brought an added dimension of vulnerability in Tris, and there is just something fascinating about her that really makes you pay attention when she's on the screen. And Kate Winslet was excellent as always in bringing cold and calculating Jeanine to life.IMDb: 7.6/10Rotten Tomatoes: 40% (From projectreel: http://projectreel.wordpress.com)","

The Premise I daresay was decent enough for an engaging Sci Fi movie, but this falls flat on its face so hard it broke its jaw and nose within the first 15 minutes. A good lead actress in a shoddy plot/screenplay, crawling along at a horrible pace with no direction whatsoever. Please avoid this movie, even when it ends up on Cable in a month or so.

"Divergent","anisandaru","12 May 2019","Divergent is a science fiction film in action, fantasy and adventure. The divergent was officially released on March 18, 2014 in Los Angeles. The film was directed by Neil Burger, Evan Daugherty, and Vanessa Taylor.
The divergent tells of the city of Chicago which was destroyed by war. To create peace, 5 factions formed according to personality. Abnegation that is unselfish and simple. Erudite is smart and prioritizes science. Good and peaceful Amity, Candor who prioritizes honesty, and Dauntless who is brave and free. Whereas Divergent are people who have more than one faction in their personality.
Children who are 16 years old must take a test to choose a faction. After the test, Tris has 3 results there are Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite. Tris must keep his identity as a Divergent. During the selection ceremony, Tris finally chose Dauntless. It turns out that only 10 people will be elected as official Dauntless members. Because of abstinence and intelligence, Tris managed to become a member of Dauntless.
But chaos occurs when Erudite controls Dauntless's brain to attack Abnegation. Tris who is not affected by serum pretends like the others. At that time, Tris knew that For was also a Divergent. Eventually an attack was carried out by Erudite against Abnegation. In addition, Divergent hunting is also underway. However, all can be thwarted by Tris, Four, Marcus, Caleb, and Peter. The five of them fled with the train go to beyond the wall.
This movie have an easy to understand path. In addition, the acting of the players successfully supports the story. Divergent films are in accordance with the character of teenagers who want to find their identity.","

"Divergent","Benjamin-M-Weilert","8 March 2019","While The Hunger Games really cornered the market in the ""young adult dystopian future"" category, many authors jumped on the bandwagon to cash in on this phenomenon. I'll admit that many of these series that got movie adaptations I had never heard of before and likely will not see/read. The Divergent series, though did stand out as the top of ""the rest"".It can be difficult to create a dystopian world, especially one that's at least somewhat set in our current one. The CGI-modified Chicago looks pretty good for a city that's been through what it has, but where the computer imagery really comes to shine is in the dream sequences. I would have liked them to be a little more obvious so the audience isn't always guessing if it's a dream or not, but that's part of the charm, I suppose. Having since read the book this was based on, I do have to say that the director made some good decisions on what areas to cut in order to keep the intent of the book, but at a pace that works better for a film. In fact, the dream sequences were even more difficult to pin down in the book than they were in the movie, so the film did a good job with that.However, this film still struggles with the ""teenage angst"" that many YA adaptations have. Of course, because of this and the aforementioned CGI, this film does get the feeling like it's a mashup of The Hunger Games and Avatar: The Last Airbender. That being said, the plot and societal structure felt thoroughly thought out and it truly helped distinguish between character archetypes when they are connected to specific colors.Surprisingly well-developed plot and characters with a good visual feel, I give Divergent 4.0 stars out of 5.","

"Divergent","fciocca","15 September 2019","This review will contain many spoilers regarding the story.Divergent is a movie with good premises, but since the beginning you already know that you are not going to watch an original movie. In fact for the whole duration I had a sense of Deja-vu: set in a dystopian future, after the ending of ""The War"" (?), the Chicago population is divided into 5 different factions. Everyone need to be fitted in one of these categories or you will end up as a homeless and factionless individual rejected by everyone. In order to decide which section you belong, you need to perform a test that tells which is the best faction for you, but during the ceremony day you get to decide which is the best option for you. Our main character is Tris, that during the test seems to belong to more factions. These people are called Divergents and cannot be controlled. They are considered really dangerous from the society and as soon as they detect one, they simply kill them.So, another movie that tells that nobody belongs to a fitted category, that anyone should think with their own brain, and should have their own idea. Nothing original, but premises remains okay. The main issue of this movie is the lenght: almost 2 hours and a half. The first hour is focused on Tris, that after choosing the Dauntless faction, basically the group dedicated to protect the population, tries to integrate herself inside the faction in the best way possible, even if she is clearly not fitted, a thing that insted of being slow cooked, could have been resolved with a short montage, or, if the director felt the need to elaborate on, in a 20 minutes sequence, saving the viewer from the boredom. Finally the story begins and everything is so predictable, including the love story with his trainer, that is in the air since the first moment they met. The main villain is an erudite that want to genocide an entire faction that manage the city, so she, with her faction can finally take over the government. In my opinion she is not very credible as a villain and in the end was also pretty easy to defeat.The acting is very flat, Shailene Woodley has the same expression for the whole movie, you cannot tell the diffference between happiness and sadness on her face and when she acts, she use always the same way of speaking. Theo James is the same. I wonder who did the casting and how they could pick so poor actors, especially if we are talking about the main ones.I will try to watch the complete trilogy, before saying that the entire saga is completely unworth to be watched, but this movie is in fact very predictable: it uses a narrative scheme very well known and that you see a lot nowadays. It is a brainless Hollywood movie made for early teenagers (like 14/15 years old, maximum), if, of course, they manage to go through the entire movie.I gave 4 stars out if 10 because CGI is on point and I really liked this distopian world. Also allucinations inducted by a special serum, are well studied.","

"Divergent","bemyfriend-40184","3 May 2021","It's for teen girls. Telling them to be brave, to be diversified. It's telling them to have many interests, and aspects to one's self. And that is a good thing. As a film, it was fine. The action was okay, the pace was okay, the characters and actors were fine. In my time, gender roles were very strict. Girls didn't do boy things; and boys didn't do girl things. I think the author of the story is trying to say that people are diversified. They are divergent. In the story, the leaders feared diversity; because it is harder to control. So they doubled down. But maybe if people were allowed to be free, they wouldn't be so mean.","

"Divergent","billy-94115","7 September 2015","Last year, I was dragged to this movie by my family. When the trailers were starting I said to myself, ""maybe it's not gonna be that bad, maybe I might really like it."". Then the opening narration started, and I knew I was going to be tortured. What followed was a long, (or at least felt long) crap-fest that rips off who knows how many movies. Bad acting, bad plot, bad action, and just plain bad. So far this is the only time I've fallen asleep in a theater. A lot of people are saying Shaliene Woodley is a good actress but after seeing this, I'm never going to agree with them. For Hollywood cash grabs, this is definitely one of the worst. To quote Roger Ebert, ""This is not scraping the bottom of the barrel, nor it is not under the barrel, it isn't ever the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be in the same sentence as the barrel."". People, save your money, skip this movie.","

"Divergent","diafora17","23 July 2014","Take a brilliant concept that reflects some possible future scenario - inspired by the marvelous Aldous Haxley's 'Brave new world' - add a twisted 'matrixinian, hunger games' wanna be variation from Veronica Roth - and finally make a Hollywood film out of it; what do you have? An insult to human intelligence.The first 5 minutes of the film, focused on the essence. They where great. The rest of the long 2 hours where a bad mixture of the hunger games without the hunger, the matrix without mr Anderson, star treck without the stars, and dumb running, kicking, fighting, agonizing for no reason what so ever mambo jumbo. Overall quality? No better than a B class TV series. So why 7.4 in IMDb? Surely can't tell (paid reviews I presume). So I give a one star to balance things out. What is the message? In a future where mankind faces serious identity issues, where individuality is replaced by casts, where society is a threat to humanity... then what does one do??? Learn karate, pick up a gun and shoot the hell out of the bad guys!!! Wooaaoou! Totally mature and intelligent! I seriously prefer swangeneger's philoshopy 'Destroy da planat and get da hell oder heeer'.Hollywood's intention: Insult humans to the degree they begin to like it. Make ridiculous films so that every one turns into TV shows. Then keep serving them insulting TV shows... they won't mind... they are 'brain dead' to quality and originality. Thank's Hollywood, I'll pass (next time at least, cause I wasted 2 hours+ watching this crap).","

The way they advertised the movie I thought its going to be something but in real its nothing but a poor try to adopt a very good book. I was wondering all the time what is the big deal of being a divergent than when I came to know there was only one question ""so What?"".Personally I am a big fan of Shailene Woodley, I have already listed her as one of my favourite diva but watching this movie I would say she got beauty but no talent. Her expression shows lack of seriousness. Still the 5 stars I gave this movie is only because of her.I am never gonna recommend anyone to go and watch this movie.","

"Divergent","bryank-04844","17 August 2015","'Divergent',much like what it means to be a Divergent, never finds its pacing, story, or place in its 140 minute run-time, which is way to long in this case. The movie is unorganized, clunky, awkward, and cheesy. It never delivers a suspenseful atmosphere or on the gritty-mature nature of the story that it prides itself in having. Sure, it might have these aspects in the book version, but it is non-existent on film. I'm sure the word-of-mouth of this movie was not persuade movie-goers who are not familiar with the books to venture out and take a look, but those die-hard fans are sure to turn out in droves to see the hot male actors deliver their favorite lines.Again, the story takes place sometime in the future in a war-torn Chicago, where the remaining survivors of whatever happened are put into different factions to live and contribute to society at the age of 16. Each faction does something different whether it be lead, help others, grow food, or provide security. Much like when you're a teenager, trying to fit in to a certain group or discovering your true identity, each 16 year old is given a sort of test with hallucinogenic drugs that will tell them which faction they will most likely be in, which our main star Beatrice or Tris for short (Shailene Woodley) is labeled as a Divergent, which is bad news for society, as she doesn't exactly fit in with any faction. This means she can think on her own and not follow orders. People are supposed to report Divergents so they can be killed, but on the big ceremony day, these teenagers choose which faction they join for the rest of their lives.Only in this future, once you choose your faction, you can no longer see your family again if you choose a different faction from theirs and the one you grew up in. This isn't really explained in logical terms and doesn't make sense. Tris was born into the Abnegation faction, which is a peaceful and humanitarian group of people who lead the rest into a good future. But Tris seems to like the Dauntless faction, which provide security for people, and are loud, fun, and look like punk rockers. Hell, the way the even arrive looks fun as they jump off a moving train and and walk into the Choosing Ceremony like they were in some rock/rap music video, while the rest of the factions are in colored long robes, resembling a court judge.Upsetting her parents (Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn), Tris chooses Dauntless while her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) chooses Erudite, the faction that is all business and led by Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), who is quite good as a villain here. As soon as Tris joins her new faction, she and the rest of the recruits start training in the underground tunnels of a train line which is now home to the Dauntless. Since the Dauntless are the ""police"" of this new world, there is a lot of physical training to go through, which is led by Eric (Jai Courtney), a rough no-non- sense man who would kill his best friend in a blink of an eye. After the first hour of Tris going through physical exercises that would make a marine think twice and some full-contact fights with the other recruits, Tris realizes there is something much more sinister at work here than protecting the people.One of the leaders of Dauntless is called Four (Theo James), and notices something different about Tris on how's she' not like the rest. Four administers a series of more hallucinogenic tests to look for her fears and to see how she deals with these situations. But her test results always prove that she is a Divergent, but of course Four and Tris are attracted to each other so nobody finds out. We come to find out half way through the film that the Erudite faction is planning a takeover Nazi- Germany style by drugging the Dauntless into soldiers and killing every man, woman, and child that belongs to the Abnegation faction. Now Four and Tris must make out and destroy the Erudite faction's plans before blood is shed, all while they are under everyone's radar.This PG-13 movie never gets to gritty for people under thirteen, but it so desperately wants to be that. The interactions between the characters are clumsy and are not given enough time to feel any real emotion for when something drastic happens with the exception of Tris. There aren't really a whole lot of good fight scenes or big special effects either. This first installment in the 'Divergent' series seemed like one big 2.5 hour set-up for something bigger, that ultimately won't pay off. Woodley and Winslet are the best here as Winsley delivers her character with a vicious angle and Woodley gives a great and charming performance like she always does. A lot of people are saying that Theo James turns in a great performance here, but they are all wrong. His performance is one-note, boring, and has no energy. If this movie was James's demo reel, I would not cast him in anything in the future. Miles Teller, Jai Courtney, Mekhi Phifer, and Zoe Kravitz all turn up here as well, but aren't given a whole lot of screen time. But Teller as always is hilarious and great on-screen.The filming isn't that great either and seems like a paint-by-the-numbers shooting script than anything that would force us to think or entertain. The score is uninspired even though Hans Zimmer was credited as an executive score producer, and it never adds to any emotion or suspense happening on-screen. I guess 'Divergent' has nowhere to go but up.","

"Divergent","RossRivero99","15 December 2014","Neil Burger's Divergent is a bad film version of Veronica Roth's 2011 best-selling book of the same name set in a futuristic world in which there are factions that are based on somebody's virtue. It stars Shailene Woodley (who was brilliant in The Descendants (2011), but flopped in this movie) as Tris a girl who gets tested for some unknown reason and learns that she is ""Divergent"" and can't fit in, and ends up going to some training and also ends up falling in love with her instructor (played by Theo James in a very nauseating performance) whose name is hilariously the number Four and also meets another instructor named Eric (played by Jai Courtney whose performance reminds me of the way that Alfred Molina portrayed Johann Tetzel in Luther (2003). Then after that Tris finds out all of this information from her mother (played by Ashley Judd) and the culprit for the attempted Divergent destruction is a woman named Jeanine (played by Kate Winslet). There was a lot of other things that I didn't like about this film besides it's storyline but the acting, cinematography, directing, and especially the action sequences in which the action scenes were shot way too quickly, though i only liked two things in this movie which were the casting, and the stunt-work to the film.The one thing I don't get when it comes to watching it is when people like this film for no apparent reason at all but by just saying it's ""great"" though I had many reasons to criticize it, I do think that this movie is nothing compared to sci-fi classics like Inception (2010), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Planet of the Apes (1968), E.T. (1982), Minority Report (2002), or even Jurassic Park (1993) or The Matrix (1999). Unfortunately little did I know that this was going to be a regretful experiences that this I consider to be one of the year's worst films.","

"Divergent","RevRonster","8 October 2014","""Divergent"" makes me feel like I have to take a step back and preface that all my opinions on the film are made under the basis that I am fully aware that I am not the intended audience for the film. I'm a 33 year old man who collects comic books, plays video games, and spends too much money on comic conventions every year—I'm not the person that the production had in mind for watching ""Divergent."" However, they didn't have me in mind for ""The Hunger Games"" and I came around to be a fan of that franchise—although, I admit I didn't care for the first film.While the visuals are good and it really sells the dystopian future the film is set in, and the acting could have easily been a lot worse and, in reality, was pretty passable (although, you would think a film that has both Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd would have a little stronger performances), the film has just a way too predictable formula to really be anything but boring. I understand that this very specific subgenre that is the tween dystopia novel adaptations follow certain guidelines—all genres really do this—but ""Divergent"" felt like a ""fill in the blanks"" template for the tween dystopia film. The characters, the story, the unfolding origin of the backstory all play out exactly as you would predict it would as the opening credits begin. In fact, the film is so predictable that there is almost no need to watch it because, chances are, any prediction you make about it will come 100% true.I was pretty critical of the first ""Hunger Games"" film but the sequel won me over; however, I don't really see this happening with ""Divergent"" because the cast doesn't have enough great players thrown in, and the story, overall, is pretty bland and flavorless. Still, I won't rule out this franchise might get better and more interesting. After all, the boring beginning and the whole establishing the universe is now over so, theoretically, things can go up from herebut things can also theoretically go down, as well.","

"Divergent","batista_fan","27 March 2014","Last year, book to movie adaptations were very hit and miss. The Mortal Instruments City of Bones was an example of an absolute terrible adaptation. Completely butchered, over adapted to the point were it's like a parody of the source material. I'm not a purist, but it was simply down right sad. Nothing like the book. Then I saw Catching Fire which was an example of a near perfect book to movie adaptation. Characters nailed it, not over adapted, and properly paced. This movie Divergent however was exactly like The Mortal Instruments movie. As someone who read the books, this adaptation was an absolute embarrassment. One: This movie was over adapted! Too many important, meaningful scenes and components from the books were cut out, leaving us a Hollywood wrecked, cobbled together pretender of the book. Two: The evil characters were not evil. Plus an added bonus, most of them were devoid of character development Peter wasn't evil, he barely got any screen time! And his entourage of sociopaths, who oppressed and tried to kill Tris in the book were done terribly. Molly had two lines during the entirety of the film, and one was complimenting Tris! Drew was the worst, he was non-existent in the film. No screen time for him. And Eric, totally a one dimensional character. Lack any emotion or character development or even a reason for him to even exist in the story! Three: There was little to no conflict in this movie for the protagonist Tris. Without conflict, there is no narrative, no plot progression, and ultimately no entertainment value. Things were resolved so easy in the movie it was ridiculous. Tris is told she has failed initiation; which never happened in the books, and she just stays against orders of her superiors without complaint. What? Not plausible by any means. They should just cancel the squeal because there's no talent, evident of this movie. 1/10","

"Divergent","dierregi","1 April 2017","Our teenage female heroine is Tris. Like most adolescents she needs to be part of a group, establishing at the same time that she is much superior to her peers.In her society people are conveniently divided in 5 factions (actually, 6), according to virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite (plus the factionless, the pariah of the new society). At a certain age, teenagers must decide which faction to join, regardless of the faction of origin. They are previously tested to establish their main trait and make a better choice about the faction to choose.Choices outside their birth faction are frowned upon, but still allow for the protection of belonging to faction. Not so easy for Tris. She is ""special"", therefore a threat to society because she thinks ""independently"" - whatever that means.Those like her are called ""Divergent"" and are the object of a secret witch hunt. So Tris must succeed her initiation in the adult world, while hiding her true self. It could have been a mildly interesting story, but there are too many problems, both with the plot and the filming. What of the factionless? Are they also divergent or just lazy misfits? Why nobody seems to care about this main issue of their society? Isn't the elimination of the ""divergents"" too radical a way to deal with an alleged problem?Finally, instead of developing a comprehensive plot, half of this very long movie is devoted to Tris' initiation into the Dauntless faction. Scene after scene are about her tests and trials moving the plot nowhere, except for the introduction of a dumb love story.Targeted to the same audience of The Hunger Game, this is yet another movie that made me check the time more than once. It drags along forever and the ending is so open and silly that one can hear it screaming out loud for a sequel.","

"Divergent","dewimutiah","20 March 2014","If you have read the series, you might understand the stories underlying this community mess, dividing it into five factions based on one different virtue. Of course a group of people living with only one virtue would cause chaos inside the one faction itself and affecting the society. But here, the other problem is, when your mind can't be fitted into any group, you'll be called divergent, and they'll hunt you down. That was what happened on Tris (Woodley).About the plot itself was lack of surprise for me. All the flaws of the plot originally came from the book. All about this messy complicated world, was introduced at the first part of the movie. I think it was the hardest part for Burger to explain the audience about the world of Divergent. You'll find it confusing and somehow boring. I love how Burger dealt with this. The way he built up the character of Tris turned this movie into a beautiful journey if a young woman leaving her family and society. She must learn new way of life that opposite with her old ones. Abnegation was stiff and odd. And she had to choose which one of factions she wanna live in and how she managed herself to fit into the new one, how she managed herself to face the family she left. I think it's the beautiful from Divergent for me, Woodley could deliver the emotion. The flaws of the setting and plot can be covered by the way they building the character.I think it's a good book adaptation movies. Some of adaptations ruined the original book. But Burger picked a good point of the book to develop it into a movie. Which he chose to build the journey of Tris. Fans are worried about the age of Theo James, they are expecting 18 years old actor to get the role of Four. But i think James's maturity here helped much in developing the characteristic of Four. He could bring Four's trait exactly fit. Four looks mature and capable of handling things.The romance wasn't too cheesy, not like the other teenage romance.What Burger did, make this teen stories acceptable for adult audience. Even though, the plot and setting is kind of mess. But Burger and the team, so the actors, did, yeah, okay, in developing Divergent movie. For me it is a good book adaptation movie. I was surprise by the lead actress performance.I recommend you to watch, until the studio gets enough profit and pick the sequels. Because this one isn't kind of standalone movie. The mystery of the factions hasn't solved in the end of the movie, and i love to watch the other journey of Tris and Four, and how that world recover.","

The futuristic dystopian setting is hard to accept, and even if you do, it's difficult to understand the motivations of many of the characters in it.It is similar to many other ""young adult"" movies, and it probably hits its target audience better than it hits me. But, allowing for some plot holes and similar, I wish the setting had been more interesting and understandable. Maybe this will be more in focus in the later movies? Why the society looks like it does? It is never really awful, though. If you manage to go along with the premise, the movie is easy to swallow.

"Divergent","Amari-Sali","21 March 2014","Trigger Warning(s): Violence against women & short scene showing attempted rapeLet me first state I did not read the books and what first drew me to this film was Zoe Kravitz being in it, but after seeing The Spectacular Now, having the reunited Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller in the film was quite the bonus. Add on Maggie Q, Mekhi Phifer, and Kate Winslet, you pretty much have one of the best casted YA book adaptations, which follow the a female lead.Characters & StoryIn an Oligarchy system, featuring limited social mobility, people are split between five factions, at least in the hub of Chicago. You are either a Erudite, the highly intelligent; Amity, the farmers; the Canter, the white collar justice system; the Dauntless, the soldiers and police; the Abnegation, the social workers and government; or you are the faction less. In their world there is no in-between. Faction over blood, so if you decide to change factions from your family, there is a likely chance you may never see them again, and with the system as it is, leaving your family is almost portrayed as dishonor and disloyalty. However, there are those who want to break this system.Enter Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) who is our heroine. She is what is known as a Divergent, someone capable of fluidity between the characteristics of all the major factions, which is a problem for Ms. Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet). You see, Ms. Matthews, being the head of the Erudite clan, seemingly wants to seize power for just being part of the technological movement isn't enough. She believes the Erudite should run the government, so she decides to do two things: 1. Discredit the Abnegation faction by going after their leader and mounting support, and 2. Using the Dauntless, with their leader Max's (Mekhi Phifer) help, to commit genocide.All this leads Tris, Beatrice's new name after joining the Dauntless, on a journey which has her be tested in physical confrontation, mental abilities, and being left with very few things to fight for, but for what is left she seems willing to give her life for.PraiseNow, I don't mean to put down other YA adaption headed by women, but to me Tris was the first one which seemed human and real. Catniss seems so devoid and drained of emotion that it is like she is a robot whose AI hasn't been updated to emulate human emotions; and though I loved Beautiful Creatures, the heroine for that film seemed more so like she was made to fit some type of standard for the respectable woman. With Divergent though, Tris to me was a human character. She was written with flaws, fears, strengths and just enough of an awkwardness so that she doesn't become something worth rolling your eyes at. And I think the credit must go to Woodley. Though The Secret Life of the American Teenager made me write off any talent she could have had, her film choices have really allowed her to blossom. She has the capability of playing someone who is vulnerable, and seemingly meek on the outside, yet can have this fierce passion which even if she gets her ass whooped, there is still a fire which makes you want to root for her. Also, I must note that for a movie a little over two hours, I never felt like I was bored. Woodley's co-stars, and the Divergent universe is so interesting to the point the missing details bother you enough to want to pick up the book. And perhaps that is the biggest praise you can ever give in this day and age.CriticismHowever, and mind you some of this criticism is due to not reading the book, I do wonder why despite all the technological advances, even with the apocalypse, there are no telephones? I ask this because each faction is somewhat secluded, and I could not understand how these people cut themselves off from their families? I mean, young adult rebellion from what you grew up in makes sense, but to seemingly do it forever? I don't get it.But, perhaps my biggest issue is that it Divergent follows a lot of the usual standards for Young Adult adaptation to screen. And I won't spoil too much of it, but as you watch nothing really does feel like you can't guess the next move. I mean, as Tris goes through her trials you do wonder where her journey could go, but after a certain point you can see things are set in stone. However, perhaps my biggest issue is the fact they pair Tris with a love interest, and though said love interest doesn't have someone to compete with, at the same time I would love for a movie like this with a Hayao Miyazaki type way of showing friendship between the sexes, instead of always having it go toward a relationship being endgame.Overall: Worth SeeingTo me, this is better than The Hunger Games and so much easier to get into. Woodley seems very in her element, and between the action, the friendships, and the threat of domination, it is very satisfying. And though I doubt I will read the books, I will likely spoil everything for myself by checking the Wikipedia entry. So, with that said, go see it!","

"Divergent","redber","18 March 2014","""I don't want to be one thing, I want to be good, honest, & kind."" It is here. Like kids waiting for cookies in the oven. The moment of truth has come. From the beloved book by Veronica Roth, Hollywood has their grasp on this baby, diaper inside out. So how was it?I always wanted to see a 60s, 70s stylized sci-fi, Pink Floyd inspired. Unfortunately, the style nowadays settles with fake, eye-rolling & desensitizing teen material, separating young people's appreciation with good cinema for this. So where does Divergent fit in? Come on, where doesn't it? This is the epitome of modern-day, 3-week cinematic hit, & forgotten two star snore on a Sunday afternoon 2 years from release on Shaw. Yeah, the acting, the story, & the vision here is flat all around. These actors will get their fame & clinch a lifetime spotlight in Young People's magazine, & TMZ laughs. So it's another wretched teen blockbuster. The look of this dread, it's disgusting & destroys my palette. I believe a Juno-quirky teenage styled flick, fused with an intense sci-fi is an interesting conception. However, the game plan & execution results show. Now Imagine a Rainbow, Pull-n-peel licorice, if each peel was a different color & was pre-pealed, & each peal defined a film genre, you'd have the layout for Divergent. It's not free nor comfortable. To satisfy hormone-confused teens, they heavily coat it with held-back character interactions & motivations, never reaching or exploring above or below the norm. Maintaining teen-equilibrium content of an awkward nature, which in itself is awkward, with one somehow managing to free themselves & enjoy that in an unbelievably grand fantasy universe as it's backdrop. Tis unmixed, left to dry. Too afraid of doing or even trying. It remains a scattered vision not knowing what it is, forgetting what it is, & leaving asking the critic's swear word: why?There's a big twist. I read the book, & it is a rhythmically flowing experience filled with page-turning thrills and emotion. The film, which many passion-lacking productions exploit easily, breaks down the story to so many different visions, it's as if several directors manhandled the project. The story was compromised in the process. Nothing was clear nor soothing or enduring. Every 5 minutes I felt I needed to re-engage myself because the music went off the page too often to care.It is on the verge of a Broken Picture. Maybe that's the vision, a new revolution in cinema we are yet to settle with. Maybe this picture is ingenious in every way. You'll have to go see for yourself, if you dare to tread such sociopathic material. Be my follower, Diver.","

"Divergent","dilipbts","7 June 2020","When reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate to film. It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best.","

"Divergent","schmidteren","22 July 2014","Filled with plot holes, clichés everywhere, out of this world unnatural dialogue.It probably would have worked fine for me if I was a teenager, and haven't seen as many movies as I have. The movie takes too many ""textbook"" ways, while also lacking a lot in character developments. If I could describe the world presented, it is very teenager like. You could say it reminds me of another movie not in my age group ""Twilight"".I don't think there is more worth saying about this movie. As a very avid movie watcher, it's def not worth watching. But for pure spectacle, it is still suggested for non avid movie people, and the younger audiences.Have a great day and thanks for reading.","

"Divergent","kermitkid","30 March 2020","Despite what most people think this is nothing like ""The Hunger Games."" Are there similarities? Yes, but there are also similarities to the Giver and I don't hear people calling plagiarism on that. While some of the dialogue is a bit cliche, and it felt like I'd seen some of the movie before, as a whole, I enjoyed it. They could have chosen a better actress for the main character, Tris, because at times it feels like Shailene Woodley is not delivering the dialogue as she should be. Sometimes she sounds bored, and sometimes she overacts, but Kate Winslet portraying the evil leader of their post-apocalyptic world saves it because she's almost as creepy as Donald Sutherland's portrayal of President Snow in the Hunger Games. I enjoyed the subtle bits of humor sprinkled throughout what is otherwise a dark film. The first hour or so was a bit slow, but the third act was great. I was really enthralled by Hans Zimmers' score, and the electronica music inserted here and there, even though it makes no sense to have it there. I have never read the books (and don't plan to because I want to be surprised) but still enjoyed the film. This is one YA novel film adaptation series I hope succeeds.

"Divergent","talisencrw","16 August 2016","I decided since this was my mother's 75th birthday to check out the first of the 'Divergent' series, since I love Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd, and Neil Burger's earlier 'Limitless' was intriguing and decent for recent sci-fi. Unfortunately the actors playing the main protagonists and the special effects were atrocious, the paper-thin plot was resoundingly predictable and I couldn't wait till it ended.Definitely one Burger that was way overdone.Of course Hollywood garbage like this produces a ton of sequels, while much better and original projects get kicked to the gutter It descended into a shoot-em-up, which must have made Republicans and the NRA happy. It's a half hour too long, given epic treatment when it deserves far less, and the dialogue's terrible, as if a high school student had written it. I'll pass on any sequels. And the poster's hilarious--Four transcends his fear of heights, just to get Tris' butt in his face. I hope for his sake she didn't have tacos for lunch.","

"Divergent","yoitsjaydee77","3 April 2014","Honestly when I first read Divergent, I was clinging onto the front of my chair and really excited when I heard that the movie was coming out. I was satisfied, but dissatisfied by the movie. SATISFIED: I was really satisfied with some of the scenes such as the zipline. Now the zipline was something I was angry and happy about. I thought just the journey through the ziplining was cool and the music was amazing. It was also really cool how in the initiation and they were eating, Max told all the initiates to rise and they picked them up and I thought that was really cool. I also liked how the Dauntless were always hooting and shouting when running and I pictured it exactly like that. I really liked the soundtrack. Kind of made it epic and cool in that sense. The ferris wheel scene was really cool too The action and the fighting scenes were amazing and intense.. a bit too long though. DISSATISFIED: Now back to the ziplining, the fact that the initiates just easily dragged Tris along was a bit confusing. Also the fact that Uriah is barely.. probably not even mentioned in the movie is just unbelievable. He becomes one of Tris' very good friends throughout the series. The love of Four and Tris seems VERY confusing and forced. The chemistry is very intense and sexy, but.. seriously. ""Are you kidding? What makes you think you can talk to me?"" like. in the book you were so nice and crap and now you're and asshole. cool Four real cool. And an asshole to an implied and questionable sex scene to immedietly saying ""I love you"" is just A BIT strange don't you think? This whole movie in general seems too rushed like. no. nonono. Like all the characters that were meant to be important were just brushed over. Al's death seems so unimportant, you don't even get to dive in who Will is making his death seem also not important as it should have been, Edward is not even mentioned which is strange because his hatred of Peter in the second book will not be well explained when it comes out like. That's the guy who stabs Edward in the freaking eye for goodness sakes. The scenes are all chronologically wrong. Especially the ""visiting day"", the capture the flag/ziplining scene, Tris to Caleb's visit, and omg so much more. Also what's with the Tris getting cut out and running back on the train part? And Eric saying ""Who let you out?"" And Tris saying ""Me""... Eric responding ""Okay""??? Like.. you're okay with someone riding along who you CLEARLY cut out? Seriously? And you don't do anything about it? I was expecting something like her getting literally thrown off the train. Also, the roles of the factionless were unexplained. They just seemed like helpless little hobos that you don't want to be with. They run jobs such as running the trains and cleaning up mess. And the jerkish hateable parts of Peter.. weren't present. He wasn't an asshole. He wasn't even an asshole. He was supposed to, but it seemed like he was trying to hard. I love Miles Teller, but he CANNOT play a bully.. it just doesn't work out like that.. And what's with the ""Hey Tris, that was pretty cool"" said by Molly? Molly and Tris are legit enemies. not friends. Also the determination of the initiates for surviving and ACTUALLY GETTING IN DAUNTLESS was brisked over as well as the dangers. The pit isn't even a pit. The chasm? What chasm? And what happened to the Dauntless girl who died from jumping off the train? That was supposed to symbolize that even the Dauntless aren't safe. Talking about cast.. the acting.. some of it was.. not. good.. like Al's line when throwing knives, the ""scared of being shot at by an airborn knife"" line was just said. not even acted. Tris gets shot running with Four at the end, but.. recovers? She runs perfectly after. If I got shot in the shoulder, I'd probably be crying the whole time. Like seriously.. How come Jeanine was so nice? like. isn't she a bitch? or supposed to be that is? ""Stop. Are you hurt?"" This was said by Jeanine when Tris was at the Erudite Compound to visit her brother. Is she even supposed to care? Also, in the book, when Tris goes to try to stop the sim, she finds Four ALONE IN THE ROOM CONTROLLING THE COMPUTERS. Okay. alone. controlling computers. no. He was being tested.. or so I think.. and he was with other Erudites and Jeanine who happened to be there. Oh and also. If you're going to put Jeanine there, at least kill her instead of knocking her down.. seriously.. How come Tris gets to grab the flag and not Christina? I thought that was supposed to be vital for their friendship, at least to Tris. And the fact that Tori was a bitch in the room taking the aptitude test was weird.There's actually more but.. you know :)","

Divergent is a combination of The Hungers and Harry Potter with all the pickings for the right house or faction, whatever. The most idiotic part was the parents' death scene: cry like hell for the mother, don't even bother for the father. Overall, totally not impressed: uninteresting, not original, and extremely long . But I don't know what I expected actually. Maybe the books are interesting, who knows. After seeing the movie I won't read them.

Shailene Woodley shows great acting chops in the lead role. It's not a perfect film. Sometimes you wanted to see a bit more of the political backdrop going on while the main character is going through her personal journey. Unlike the Hunger Games Films (Of which I love those books - haven't read the 2nd and 3rd Divergent Books yet) thus far, with similar themes - the Movie doesn't peek into scenes beyond the Protagonist's prospective to add depth. But overall the film keeps you interested. 3 1/4 out of 4 Stars.","

"Divergent","mgruebel","13 October 2015","The film is not at all bad, if one takes it on its own terms: a fairytale disguised as young adult movie. It has all the ingredients: a surreal environment, moralism, odd characters (puss-in-boots, seven dwarfs anyone?). The message is the same dark message found in many fairy tales: You will grow up, the world is bad, and your parents will die.Shailene Woodley as ""Tris"" has to grow up fast when Kate Winslet, leader of the brainiacs in a quintipartite society that lives in the fenced-in ruins of Chicago after WW III, decides it's time for the smart guys to take over. Tris joins the ""Dauntless,"" the solider-faction that keeps the peace among brains, public servants, growers, and truth speakers (meet the press of the future?), not counting the homeless. As a ""Divergent"" who embodies elements of all five factions, Tris confronts the master plan, and in the process, she must face her worst fears, find love, and see her parents die as she loses the innocence of her childhood. In this fairy tale, Tris and her Divergent boyfriend are thus the only full humans, or real people. The viewer will identify more with some factions than with others, but of course we are all divergent, and so it is easy to identify with Tris.There are problems that keep this well-intentioned film from reaching higher. For one thing, the dystopia is so sad (like a particularly grim Brothers Grimm tale), that I would have rooted for the brains, had their plan not included killing a fifth of the population. That plan is not very brainy. Why not just inflict the mind-control potion on the public servants directly, instead of on the soldiers? No killing needed, more population to do the bidding of the brains. If I were a scientist, that's how I would have arranged things...but wait - I am a scientist!In a fairy tale, we must not dig too deep for logic. Instead, there is a well-paced story with sympathetic lead characters, villains who are bad but convinced of their own goodness (almost always true of real political villains), and the moral pontificating is fairly minimalistic. I found it quite watchable for 2 hours and 17 minutes, although it would have been better with about 25 minutes cut out. That's true for many overly long action movies nowadays - few can hold to the line like Besson's ""Taken"", a 90 minute fairy tale of princess in distress rescued by the king that's a good notch above this film because it is concise.Decently executed view-once coming-of-age story, like Hunger Games or Mazerunner.","

"Divergent","vistheindian","6 April 2014","Quickie Review:With the popular demand for young adult novel adaptations, comes yet another movie called Divergent. Tris (Shailene Woodley) learns that she is a Divergent, a threat to a post-apocalyptic society as she doesn't fit in its system. Now she must try to survive the witch-hunt for all Divergents. This movie is as generic as it gets for this genre: love interest, protagonist is special but that's not a good thing, training montages, and so on. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Woodley's character Tris. Beyond that there is not much else you will care about.Full Review:In a post-apocalyptic world, a society has been sustained in the ruins of Chicago. In this city the population is divided into five factions, where every citizen must fit into so they can fill a role of the society. The main protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley), finds herself to be a Divergent, someone who doesn't fit in any faction and therefore a threat to the system. Tris along with her mentor, Four (Theo James), must now find a way to put an end to a plot to hunt down every Divergent.Divergent is directed by Neil Burger, who has previously made The Illusionist, and Limitless, both movies which I quite enjoyed for doing something different. However, this movie fades into the noise of the young adult genre and does very little to differentiate itself from the generic clichés. As a result, this movie feels very lackluster and uninspired. The world created is intriguing at first, how the society is divided into factions to avoid conflict and war. Ironically this interesting idea also works against the whole movie, because all the characters are so cookie cutter and are exactly the same as everyone else in their faction. This may be intentionally done, but it leaves the audience with little care for anyone who is in peril on screen. The only characters that have any complexity is Tris and Four. So that's where I'll give some credit to the movie, the two central characters. Shailene Woodley is a great young actress in all the movies I've seen her in, and she is the best part of Divergent. She grows as a character and conveys her struggle between fitting in and being herself convincingly. Theo James, although not an incredible actor was at least layered and likable.Movies are an experience, and my experience watching this movie showed several red flags in Divergent beyond the ones I already mentioned. There were moments in the movie that were meant to be taken seriously but come off so melodramatic and awkward that I, including the rest of the audience in the cinema burst into laughter at its unintentional ridiculousness. Also the movie spent too much time on the training aspect of the movie, to the point I partially forgot what the conflict of the movie was. It only got to the real meat of the plot at the last 30mins of a 2hr 20min movie! There is one line that is uttered about the world outside of the fenced off city of Chicago. At the end of the movie, some of my friends and I agreed that we found that one line to be more interesting than the rest of the movie. That is not what a movie is supposed to make the audience feelAll in all, this is not a movie that is a must see. Perhaps the fans of the novel it's based on will enjoy this movie more than I did. Still I would not recommend spending your money to watch it in the cinema. If anything just wait for the DVD/Blu-ray release. It's a watchable movie because of Woodley's performance, and I appreciate the effort but I can't say I enjoyed it.","

"Divergent","hugorocksmy","21 March 2014","Even though this movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was a good start for the franchise. One of the best things about the movie was Shailene Woodley performance, she was excellent as Tris, and you could feel her every emotion in her face but mainly in her big beautiful eyes. And although it wasn't as very well showcased in the beginning, you could see it flowing out of her in the final third act. Moreover, the story felt kind of bland at times and as if it never reached its high point, which sincerely kind of came in the end multiple times, which led the ending to miss great opportunities to end ambiguously exciting. Therefore, it had an interesting premise, that can eventually become more interesting as the movies progress, but meanwhile this movie covered what probably any other franchise would've done in one. This never felt as good as Twilight or even The Hunger Games, and it might need to work more with its characters, because I found it hard to relate to any of them, but it isn't that far behind of any of the previous movies.","

"Divergent","Stautis","14 April 2014","The thoughts going through my head during the majority of this movie was: ""Has this really been published as a book?"" and ""This seems like something I could write"". And I just don't tell myself that, it actually seems vaguely similar to something I wrote years ago on an exam. Welcome to a world where all the guys look strangely familiar and have forgettable names. Apparently there has been some sort of war that almost wiped out humanity. A small part of the population has however managed to seal Chicago off. The founding fathers of this society has clearly been reading up on dystopia and has come to a conclusion that Hunger Games is the way to go. Only smaller. This is all acted out where plot holes are blatantly overlooked and the identity of a character really isn't that big a deal.Suffering from a lot of vibes similar to that of the vastly inferior first Hunger Games movie. One can see a movie going for the same social commentary void of the core originality. The originality was also lacking, although not to the same degree, in the aforementioned film. This obviously isn't to much of a problem seeing as how it's really not THAT similar in the way the movie gets the message across, but there are very similar traits to this film and you can draw some lines that would be hard to credit for being original. As I haven't read the book i can't say if that's something to blame on the author of the book or the writers working on the screenplay. To me it seems like whoever was in charge of what was going on towards the end of the film got a bit sick of working on this. There are scenes in this movie where you may find the dialogue laughable or spine-tingling and cringeworhty. This goes for the story as well, when you're not able to tell where this movie is headed it takes a turn for the worse. However, don't worry, the guy next to me proved that predicting this movie from start to end isn't really an achievement. I'm not gonna say that the acting was terrible, but it had it's definitive weak moments. Towards the end, and I don't think this will surprise anyone, there is a crying scene. It may actually be one of the most annoying moments I've ever seen on the silver screen or on any screen for that matter. I could go on pointing everything that is wrong with this movie, but i won't. There are redeeming factors to this movie. I think the cinematography has some shining moments, maybe with a bitter aftertaste of pretentiousness. Anyone familiar with the musical works of Woodkid will know that his music has cinematic traits as a result of several years behind the camera, which I personally think is great. It really goes along well with this trendy and ""not-so-dark-dystopian"" world. Ultimately it seems like a mix of Equilibrium and, as i already have mentioned to the point where it becomes boring(much like the message of this movie) The Hunger Games. You take the mush, cover it in 100$ bills, add a relatable teenage identity crisis, some predictable romance and overthrowing of a government and you have yourself a hit, at least among the younger generation. Clearly though they haven't gotten it all wrong. My younger sister at the age of 16, seemed to think much better of this film. Hmmm... Go figure.","

Along with the played out story line and plot this film was filled with mediocre acting and tired character lines. After seeing this film I can now legitimately compare it to ""The Hunger Games"", since everyone else does. There really is no comparison. ""The Hunger Games"" is better. ""Divergent"" is really more like a knock off, I'm not trying to be cruel but that's kind of what it is, of course with some differences. In this film society is broken down into the brave, the peaceful, the intelligent, the selfless, and the honest, but a divergent is someone who's mind is versatile and can carry themselves in any lethal situation. The average person has at least two or more of these traits at the same time so I think almost everyone in that society would be a divergent. Because this film is almost like the ""The Hunger Games"" some people who enjoyed ""The Hunger Games"" will probably enjoy this one but in my opinion ""The Hunger Games"" is better.","

But in this movie, people seems dumber. People are forced to join five different factions, purportedly to promote peace. And once they decided which faction to join, they are not allowed to change. Why is that? No explanation is offered in the movie.Since it is known that some people belong to the divergent category (who are hunted and killed), and they can be revealed during the fear test, why isn't anyone else monitoring the test so the divergents can be caught immediately? There are many other stuff that doesn't make sense if you think about them. So to enjoy the movie, it's best not to think.","

"Divergent","falynsoul","22 March 2014","I think this franchise would be better served by being treated to a full budget HBO production 10-13 episode run. The world the books create is highly detailed, gritty, and chock full of emotional depth and events that are just not possible to represent well in a 2-3 hour film.That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film for what it did offer. The mental pictures I developed through reading the books were eerily similar to the ones in the movie. I tend to favor a movie's art style and atmosphere over acting/character development so I may be biased here. The post-apoc world was tastefully done, and didn't go overboard with blue glowing screens and lighting. The overall color tone is well balanced and natural, something that cannot be said for a lot of films that tend to feature over-saturated skies and light sources.Acting seemed solid to me. I tend to miss certain cues from the book, so if a character was acting differently than in the book, I probably didn't notice. The movie won't shock you or make you cry, but it did make me feel exhilarated at certain points. It was nice to not have unnecessary sex scenes for once. I'm not against sex in film at all, don't get me wrong. I just think the romance was done tastefully done.Overall, a solid release. (no pun intended)","

"Divergent","bkoganbing","27 September 2014","In a futuristic society the population is divided into castes based on aptitude tests. The names should give you an idea of what direction the people are led into. Erudite, Candor, Amity, Abegnation, and the warrior caste Dauntless. It's this caste that is the defender of the established order. Of course there's a lot of folks out there who are casteless, didn't make the grade in any caste and now are something along the lines of the Hindu untouchable. But the rarest of all are those people whose intelligence quotient is so high they can test into any category. They are called Divergent and the established order fears them because they can move chameleon like into any faction.Shailene Woodley is such a Divergent, but she's taught to mask it well. To the surprise of many she chooses Dauntless and goes into basic training for Dauntless far more rigorous for this Spartan group than the others. Woodley also discovers a plot to turn this warrior society into some kind of Fascistic tool and this is where the action truly starts.An interesting idea if not entirely carried out successfully testing for whatever virtues one possesses for your role in society. The great unwashed out there who don't fit in are accounted for. What seems to be missing here is an account for those bad character flaws just where do they go. I suspect they are the villains of the piece but a society as advanced as should test out those people as well.Woodley makes a nice and earnest lead supported by fellow Dauntless member Theo James a young man who sees what Dauntless is being subverted into. Also note Kate Winslet who is one of the subverters.Divergent is a nice if not entirely successful portrait of a futuristic society.","

Sure the factions don't make sense in a real society but I'm here for the story. The story is quite powerful of a girl struggling to make it through dauntless tests. Its story about overcoming. It inspires. The girl is weak at first but becomes one of the best. She is divergent and doesn't fit in. I didnt understand why they would kill divergents, just make them factionless instead. But still the movie is solid with gripping story and great acting. The lead actress is phenomenal. I don't know why some people would rate this below 5. They clearly don't know what a good movie is. It is one of the most liked movies on Netflix and rightly so. It's quite entertaining as well. Never felt bored for a single moment.","

"Divergent","bbickley13-921-58664","22 March 2014","Another movie based on a bestselling novel. I think the first time I heard about this flick was when I went to see Beautiful Creatures, which is also based on a bestselling novel. I first herd of that movie when I went to see the Host, which if I'm not mistaken is also based on a bestselling novel. You get the idea. It's good to hear that young girls are reading novels.Though these movies are for young girls mostly, I do get a kick out of them. After all, most of them are centered on some super natural creatures or have a large Sci-Fi theme. This movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, which was visually awesome by the way. A War broke out about a 100 years ago, and In order to bring back order in a world fallen apart, the society sectioned off its people into 5 Fractions and when a child is old enough, they take a test to decided which fraction they actually belong too. Most people go back to the fractions they were born into with very few being chosen for a different Fraction, However in the case of the main character Beatrice, the test were not conclusive, meaning she would not fit into any Fraction. The people of this world refer to this as Divergent and being such is not good. The movie screams the message for young girls to grow up and be what they want to be, especially with the plot of Beatrice, who was born into a Fraction of mostly boring framers, choosing to join the fraction of really, really enthusiastic Law Enforcers. Although I can't help but to point out the similarities in this movie to The Hunger Games, and I must admit, though I find Beatrice who becomes Tris when she joins the Dauntless fraction, warmer than Katniss Everdeen, I realize if I have a Choice, I prefer my female protagonist tougher . There were way too many times in the movie that Tris' boy toy, Four, one of the leaders and trainers of the Dauntless, had to come to her rescue. In all fairness, this may have something to do with the fact that unlike most Super heroines that have been exploiting the big screen lately, Tris has no love triangle. She has 5 chooses to where her life will go, but only one choice in men. Maybe in the Sequel?The movie has a pretty well-known cast. Some people I knew by name like Miles Teller, who co-stared in the Spectacular Now, with Shailene Woodley, who played Tris. I felt a little sorry for the guy as he had a chance to grow in this movie outside of being type cast the sarcastic easy going best friend thing he's been doing in a lot of flicks, but it did not happen. Zoe Kravitz, who plays Tris BBF, taking after her father Lenny Kravitz, who is in the Hunger Games. Ashley Judd, who has a small but important role as Tris' mother and Naomi Watts who put on a little weight since the last time I've seen her, but still looks hot. Then their where a few faces that seem to float around the teen to young adult movies. The movie does a good job in appealing to a lot of people. Its starts as a dramatic film focusing greatly on the society these people live in, which I found unique in a movie of this caliber, but they give you a nice helping of action as well.It was a good choice for a movie to see, but I like hunger games better.","

"Divergent","rpete528","2 November 2014","Sorry...this movie sucked right out of the gate. If you are over 18 you probably won't enjoy this. This was definitely generated toward the teen population. It just seems to be a poor ripoff of the Hunger Games. It's a post war dare I say apocalyptic war time? In Chicago where people have to join factions to keep harmony and peace. If you can't fit in then you're factionless. You don't really get an idea about the war or really a full picture of who or why these factions are created. There are a lot of holes throughout this picture. You have to be tested to join one of these factions. There is just too much about this movie that is bad. The acting is weak, the writing, all of it. I basically watched this because my wife wanted to rent a movie on a Saturday night and she picked this thing. Hey Verizon, can I get my $5.99 back?","

"Divergent","t-reese1711","25 March 2014","I do not understand how anyone would expect this movie to be identical to the book. There are things that they have to do differently in the movie for certain reasons. Have you ever actually watched a movie based on a book that did everything like the book said? Of course not! To take words and bring them to life for readers on the silver screen means that things will be changed or taken away from because you just cant film some things to the T. For the most part they stayed very true to the book, with the exception of a few parts. I don't see what the big deal is. I read the book over five times and I was very impressed with the movie. When I first heard that Shailene Woodley had the role of Tris, I was worried, but she did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Veronica Roth seemed happy with the outcome and I think that's because she knew that they couldn't do everything exactly as she wrote it. Neil Burger did an amazing job directing because he made everything look real. It wasn't computerized or anything of that sort. I'm very proud of the cast and crew for creating a wonderful adaption of this book! Can't wait for Insurgent!","

They, and these films, were an attempt to coattail the Hunger Games books/films and the Twilight books/films.Shailene Woodley is not a strong actress. The one film she starred in that not only did well at the box office, but had a good platform for her acting range, was The Fault In Our Stars. It's pretty good, watch it.The films are littered with half formed ideas and plot lines, shaky effects and weak acting. Even those actors and actresses, who have been good in other things, are surprisingly (not surprisingly?) off their game in this slog.

Two of the main characters are the soldiers who are also divergent, its almost as if soldiers are closest to divergents. Whereas all erudite are shown as evil, come on give me a break. Also the romantic angle looks completely unnatural and forced. The premise made one think it wold be all about this lady who does not fit in, however soon you have this lady not just fitting in but being a super human. She fails so many tasks and yet somehow manages to recover from all of them.","

The movie does actually make me think and is pretty smart in parts, especially the Tris vs Jeanine scene towards the end, despite it's predictability. To be honest, I rather enjoyed the movie until all the corny lovey-dovey scenes between Tris and Four; the movie minus the Tris and Four ""romantic"" parts would've raised the movie's stock in my book. Another thing that would've helped was to revise the completely lame ending, which doesn't quite make sense, is totally anti-climactic and is obviously screaming out: ""SEQUEL!"". Lastly,I was hoping there'd be some explanation as to why they had to live within the boundaries of the city, apart from Tris narrating at the beginning that there was a ""war"" - which I don't fully believe, so I hoped there'd be a twist ending, but it never came. Actually the more I think about it, the more I dislike it and the more critisicism i can think of. So in the end, yeah, I didn't like it.","

"Divergent","Badmoviessuck","3 December 2018","Divergent is a bland experience and they do not do anything new with the story they are telling.ORIGINALITY
This movie has a lack of originality.
Cause 80% of the movie is just Beatrice trying to not be under the line and we see her trying to succeed, that is her desire through out the movie.
They didn't use their time to try something new with the story to improve the experience.CHARACTERS
They didn't try to develop the side characters they choose their time to only focus on Beatrice, It's fine to let the side characters have little screen time but the movie would have been better if they made the side characters have a good amount of screen time and they manage to develop the characters.
Beatrice is this bland character who has no personality whatsoever.
For me it felt like that sometimes she was a bit shy and when the plot needed her to not be shy then she wasn't, when it came to her it felt like her personality was unclear and lacking.
And during the end of the her growing as a character was almost non existent.
She began as a trash fighter and then turned into a decent fighter that's the only growth you will get from her and we never get to see how she develops and becomes a decent fighter cause when she trained hard she was still trash at fighting and then magically she could fight decently cause it was convenient for the plot.
Beatrice is there for plot convenience.
Four is bland as hell.
I'll give them some props for managing to make him grow as a character that's the only good thing about him and that growth felt rushed and poorly executed.
He has more personality than Beatrice and we could clearly see those personality traits.
Four might be bland but he is still better than Beatrice.VILLAIN
The villain was bad she had a lack of screen time and if she had more screen time she would be a decent villain.
I understand her motive that they kill the Divergents cause they are scared of the unknown but i think it could have been developed more.VERDICT
This movie is an unoriginal wasted potential that people should not watch.","

I checked my watch and alas only about 30 minutes had actually elapsed and to my further dismay the movie never did get interesting and the plot remained rather lack luster.I usually love movies set in a dystopia, but this one was on par with watching paint dry. The acting was average and that's being very generous. The action was weak. The plot was weaker. The romance forced. The characters were flat.Also try not to laugh when Tris yells ""stop it"" to the bad guys during a scene that isn't suppose to be funny yet you can't help but laugh at how ridiculous it is.

It is not as scientifically sophisticated as movies like Gattaca or Artificial Intelligence. And it's not as large scale as LOTR or Ben Hur. But it a really good flick.

Little did I know.The basic idea of the movie: We live in a post-war world, where people are divided into factions, based on virtues. As young adults, they got to chose which one they want to join. Surprise surprise, we find ""divergents"", people that don't fit into the system and are threatening its existence. They are chased and killed in a totalitarian system. Sounds familiar? I hope so, otherwise you have missed lots of movies in the last decades. The last one I have seen was ""Upside Down"", and it wasn't a great movie either, but it is so much better. And it has only a score of 6.4, I just really don't understand that.There's really not much to say about the movie itself. Lots of martial arts and gunfights, some kind of a love story, political intrigue. Characters without faces, intentions without sense, a movie without a justification for existence.","

Many people watch movies just because they have been adapted from great books but I don't believe a film should rely on a great novel. This movie is poorly executed and could have been so much better. There are striking similarities to 'The Hunger Games' but there is no comparison to how well 'The Hunger Games' has been made and the exceptional performance of 'Jennifer Lawrence'. In contrast 'Divergent', which also featured a futuristic society governed by a strict regime with numerous divisions, is not convincing and none of the characters are strong enough for the viewer to care about them. The movie seems to end up becoming a teenage romance tale and the climax is confusing and dull. Even the main theme of being a 'Divergent' is not explored or really explained, maybe this has been reserved for a sequel. However based on this movie, I definitely won't bother with any follow up movies.","

That's why every now and then a new Mtv-like teen actor who's interviews are like audiobooks of what their managers has given them to read pops up into the movie business.The formula is now known. A teen next door who is just so random and socially awkward and can't stand mainsteam fashions and activities is globally cherished as other teens crave for someone to relate to.However, that's not a new thing. In fact it's the same thing that macho men and dynamic women represented in the 90s as well as the 80s. The thing is that those actors, because of their Hollywood persona, actually had a personality. Now teen actors have nothing that would differentiate them from one another except their face. They are just mirrors for teens to put themselves on as they have no characteristic that would not match with any of their own.That's why we end with such talentless and without personality actors, and a script that supports such characters:""A common teen like any other (THAT COULD BE YOU!) finds him/herself in a situation of him/her being different of their peers(OMG THAT'S LIKE TOTALLY HOW I FEEL!) and achieve greatness being a non conformist in a world full of conformists."" sounds familiar?Please stop paying for such movies.

"Divergent","haosstoposto","4 August 2014","Another movie in the genre of Young Adult Fiction. I haven't read a book, because to be honest, most of these books are written around the same idea: rebellion of the youth coming of age against some form of totalitarian society (read: society of the adults). It is clear why these ideas are so appealing to the teenagers, it is in their nature to be rebellious. We also have obligatory love story, and that's it. Divergent did not blow me away with it's story, but it's far away from awful. The premise is interesting. In some unspecified future we see residents of post-apocalyptic Chicago living within five categories (factions) of people (Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave, and Erudite the intelligent), according to their character traits. But there are also the Divergent, people without faction, who live outside of society like Untouchlable caste in India. Each 16-year-old person must choose his/her faction and remain there for the rest of life. Our heroine chooses military faction (because they are soooo cool - and irritating) and we see her complete her combat training only to face great conspiracy between leaders of Dauntless and Erudite to seize the power for themselves. She manages to foil this plot and escapes with her friends. What happens now, we will see in an obligatory sequels. My main criticism is the portrayal of the Dauntless faction-army and police force of the city. They are shown as crazy, brave, tattooed, sexy youth and no wonder that they are so appealing to our heroine and young audience. They always run, jump, do dangerous stuff and so on. But even though one of the faction commanders says they train soldiers and not rebels, I wonder. They learn how to fight, of course, and most of the time they look like a bunch of brigands. They repeat the mantra faction before blood"", and not once in the movie I see their loyalty to the society they are bound to protect (against what, remains to be seen). Honestly, they look as coup d'état-in-waiting, but whatever. All in all, not great, not bad.","

I would have enjoyed the movie even if I had not read the book.The movie actually shows you more of the city that the story takes place in then the first book alluded to. I highly recommend this movie. It is a good one to see if you enjoyed The Hunger Games series.

"Divergent","Isvind89","26 March 2014","I'm a huge fan of the books. The psychological angst and inner fight that Tris has to fight with and against. How she want, but cant, conform into the norm of society. How she, a little girl, is hated and despised for something she has no influence over. The books have so many layers of meaning that I sometimes marvel at it. Now to the movie. I tried to watch it as a movie, not a adaption, and think I did fairly well. Yet there are a few (or many) things that really bothered me. The lack of chemistry between the lead actors. The acting in general wasn't very good except for Kate Winslet and Shailene Woodley who delivered with what they got. Yet, I am marveled over how plan, dull and one dimensional the film was. I never felt anything about the inner struggle of Tris or the psychological terror that the environment is filled up with. Divergent is a inconsistent tale that some will enjoy for the same reasons they enjoy Twilight (which I still haven't figured out how one can). The only reason I'm giving it a 5 instead of a 4 is due to Winslet and her performance. Even though her character (that is one of the most complex and sophisticated antagonist I've ever read about)is made into the classical villain with megalomania.","

Totally boring, predictable, dumb, and even the basic premise of the story is unconvincing to start with. This system with the 5 castes would not ensure any greater stability for society than the system we currently have. Even on a theoretical level, it would solve no problems and there is no logic behind it. They want people to rigidly adhere to a one-dimensional category (I'm smart, I'm considerate, I'm fierce, I'm honest, etc.) and they even assign castes for them but then they allow people to choose? You can't have democracy and dictatorship at once, you can't raise sheep but also urge them to have self-determination. So even the basic concept of the story is flawed, and no matter how good your structure is, if it isn't built on a good solid foundation, the whole thing will crumble. Take a look at the society in Brave New World, now that's hard to challenge, it's actually a very solid system even if it repulses us as we read.","

I knew she would not pick her home faction as her choice it was pretty f*****g obvious she would do that hahaha I thought the reaction of her parents was pretty f*****g funny too I had almost no sympathy for them for the entire movie their characters were rather pathetic really.We could all tell that Kate Winslets Character was going to be a villain towards the end of the movie and even her character sucked too, her motives and beliefs were very questionable and didn't really make any sense.When Tris meets Four it was very obvious that they were going to get it on later and their relationship seemed very rushed and actually pretty pointless.BUT WOW THIS MOVIE HAS ALMOST NOTHING ORIGINAL ABOUT IT!!!!------I saw everything coming, come on guys what the ****? What was the point of seeing this movie?? Why waste my time??? There was so much cringe worthy moments such as when Tris is fighting the soldiers (WHO HAVE EXTREME STORM TROOPER SYNDROME) and her mother and been shot and starts to die, the soldiers keeps shooting at the f*****g wall instead of moving in to kill her while Tris is going wwaaaaaahhhh all over her mother.Also what was so f*****g problematic of the existence of divergents? As far as I knew their only f*****g powers were in the dream simulator or whatever it was called and those weren't even special powers. Otherwise Divergents were pretty pointless.To finish this review up the script sucked, the acting was okay, the visuals were okay, plot was dumb and nothing special, characters were not really developed well.Do not watch this movie if you have any sense of what makes a good movie it really is a waste of your time.","

When I was a young adult and reading books that meant no sex, single plot lines, no swearing, and the complexities of daily living are ignored. It didn't mean that there was no plot and completely unbelievable situations.I tried, I really tried with this film, but after 30 minutes I gave up. If this is the sort of stuff young adults are reading now and this is what's considered good stuff, then let's destroy all books published in the last 20 years and start all over again.We're meant top believe that every teenager in Chicago, which has been shut off from the rest of the world, when they reach a certain age, has to choose their future career based on a drug-fuelled dream and that, once that career has been chosen, then they can never change that career. And there are only 5 careers open to them. Really? Really?!? Really! And this choice is to be made by these teenagers at a ceremony where they share blades, cut themselves on their palms and drop blood into a bowl. Really? Really! And if they want to join Dauntless - the soldiers and police - they need to have no brains, be all brawn, follow orders mindlessly, and be as reckless as possible. Really? Really! First act of the new Dauntless recruits? Jump on the non-stopping overhead trains, and then jump off a few minutes later onto the roof of a building (again whilst the train is in motion). Proof, if proof were needed, that Dauntless is full of idiots with a lot more luck than judgement.And that's just one of the 5 Factions.Yes, young adult fiction is less complex that adult fiction, but that doesn't mean brainless, it means simpler.I just couldn't switch off my higher brain functions watching this film and gave up before I felt my IQ start to ooze out of my nose, taking a permanent dive into single figures.If you really, really don't think at all when you're watching films, then you might be able to get through this one unscathed.

"Divergent","carrotbastard","29 April 2014","Goodness gravy gracious, I don't even know where to begin berating this train wreck of a film. I suppose I'll begin by criticizing the fact that the characters had little to no development whatsoever. I mean, good lord, characters that were hastily introduced during the first few minutes of the film and scarcely mentioned amid the film were hurriedly brought back with the intention of implementing those typical Hollywood cliché ""PLEASE DON'T DIE ON ME, PLEASE!"" scenes. I'm not insinuating that there is anything awry about designing characters to simply exist and complete the fictitious paradigm, but rather that the writers should be privy of the fact that the audience could care less if they die later on. The acting was also astoundingly mediocre. Even during the resolution of the film's primary conflict, you can discern an incredibly cringe inducing, spurious inflection in the antagonist's voice as she frustratedly reacts to her defeat with irritable overused phrases such as ""NO, WHY YOU."" This film also resorts to ""shocking"" or ""plot twist"" scenes roughly every five minutes. I've no antipathy for those personally, though, after the first 20 minutes of consistent ""OH NO"" moments, the audience becomes far too exhausted to care anymore.I direly wish these were all the caveats I had noticed while viewing this film, but, unfortunately, I could continue raving for an additional 5 unnecessarily long paragraphs if I direly wanted to. Alternatively, I'll conclude this review by sufficing to say that I would recommend this film to no one under any circumstances ever. It's nothing more than a try hard, egregious attempt at creating an edge-of-your-seat experience for the audience and is far more probable to leave them anticipating those enrapturing strings of text we call the credits.","

"Divergent","wakemeup36","3 September 2014","I used to be an avid movie watcher not too long ago. All sorts of movies: action, comedies, dramas, thrillers; you name it, I left no genre stone unturned. Unfortunately, it got to the point where every new movie I watched felt like a rehash of something I had seen before. I have been on a movie hiatus for about 4 years since then. I have still watched movies in this span of time but not as many as I used to. I do not observe them as carefully as I used to and don't consequently write reviews about them either. However, something about this movie awakened the critical beast within me. I have not seen such a plot less movie pretending to be deep in a long time and I need to write about it to feel like I didn't waste 2 hours of my life on nothing.What is this movie about, you may wonder? In a dystopian future, human beings are split into 5 factions. I don't remember the names of these factions and I won't bother to look them up. But basically, you have labourers, farmers, scientists, charity workers and the army. The charity workers also happen to be politicians and the scientists are jealous and want to be the politicians so they hatch an evil scheme to take over. Also, there are people who don't fit into factions and they are called 'divergent' (and are presumably talented at everything the other factions excel at), aka our main character Tris. The authorities don't like divergent very much because umm they couldn't think of a faction name for them I guess? Actually, the movie logic is that they can't be controlled. But why not? Just make a different faction for them and now you have them in line right? Oh well, let's just ignore that and take a leap of faith. The basic plot isn't anything I haven't seen before, and I've been out of touch with movies for the last few years. A lone teen/young adult in a dystopian rebelling against the really bad system that rejects them. Several movies have attempted this before, including Equilibrium, The Hunger Games etc. Does this movie do anything well enough for me to forget about the aforementioned fact? No, not really. The acting is bad, the music is annoying and the characters are terribly written.The acting is incredibly hammy. Sometimes the actors tend to overact while at other instances, they can't conjure up simple emotions. It gives the movie world a very dead feel to it. For example, a scene that is supposed to be rather dramatic towards the end of the movie has our main character bawling her eyes out like a maniac, while a similar 'tragedy' occurs a few minutes later and she doesn't bat an eye. The villain played by Kate Winslet is also emotionally dead and shows no acting range at all. Perhaps it's because English isn't my native language but I had a very difficult time making out the dialogue at times. The actors' speech felt very mumbled and incoherent.The music is very off balanced. Much of the time it overtakes the dialogue. Additionally, a lot of it isn't original music composed for the movie but popular radio songs instead which I always find a cop out when it comes to movie soundtracks. One of the scenes has knives being thrown around Tris by her instructor. It's supposed to be very intense and the music makes sure it tells us that by being very obnoxiously loud every time the instructor throws the knife. Similarly other scenes, particularly action scenes, have a very terrible use of music that distracts from the movie.The characters. Where do I even start? The main character, Tris, has to be one of the blandest characters since Bella from Twilight to be ever put on screen. She has absolutely no personality. Yes, she's 'Divergent', but what else? What does she like to eat, does she like animals, does she have any hobbies, does she like to screw around with her friends? The filmmakers made sure they don't address these questions at all, so we're left with nothing but a blank slate of a character. The other characters aren't any better in terms of development. The romance subplot is so forced, its borderline laughable. 'Hey, I touched you tattoo, let's have PG-13 intercourse now!' is the gist of the romance. The villain (Winslet) is pretty boring as well. 'I don't like human nature very much as it leads to violence so I'll use violence to destroy human nature' is her philosophy. None of the characters are interesting or have any sort of development throughout the story. The romantic interest is just a pretty face, the bad guy goons are well goons, and the main character's friends are just present as decoration pieces.Even after ignoring the unoriginal and silly plot, the movie doesn't offer anything that will make me want to look at it in a positive light. Weak characters, horrid music placement and cheesy acting clutter the movie throughout. How this had enough of a following to warrant a TV show, I will never know.","

"Divergent","a-williamson217","21 March 2014","I've never read the books, so i don't know how it compares to the movie yet, but here's my opinion: I think that it was too easy for the main characters. There was very little conflict, and not too many obstacles for the main characters to overcome. For instance; Tris is told that she's kicked out of the Dauntless group, yet 5 minutes later she follows the group and the very same person who kicks her out has nothing against it. Also, the 'limitless ammo', 'bad-shot bad guys' and 'one shot death' clichés just make the movie a whole lot worse. Also, there's no real explanation to anything. I don't know if they explain the Divergents' invulnerability to the serums and tests in the books, but all of that was completely unclear to me during the film. I have to say, at the end of the day, 5 might be a little bit nice on the critiquing chart, but i think it's appropriate for the amount of money and work put into the film.","

"Divergent","phd_travel","16 April 2014","The story is so much better than ""Hunger Games"" which I found sickeningly stupid. The more intelligent premise of Divergent is involving and you feel more for the characters. Even though the movie is long is moves a long and is well directed and well paced. The fight scenes aren't overdone which makes it convincing.The cast is likable and well cast like in Twilight. Shailene Woodley is actually good and sympathetic here seeming vulnerable and feisty at the same time. She isn't as beautiful as Lily Collins in Mortal Instruments but she is a very believable actress here. Theo James looks a bit older than her but they have good chemistry. Supporting cast is good too. Liked seeing Ashley Judd on the big screen again and she looks like she could be Shailene's mother. Maggie Q is quite a welcome presence too. Kate Winslet is suitably loathsome without overdoing it.Looking forward to the next installment.","

"Divergent","Hopstimop","23 July 2014","First of all this is way better, than ""The Hunger Games"" which is in my opinion a childish B-movie at best.Both movies suppose to be for young adults and both have a very similar story, but Divergent did it way better.Many people complain about clichés and a predictable plot, but they don't realize, that this is a movie for young adults.When I was young I loved such stories and I didn't see their clichés, because I didn't KNOW that those are clichés.You have to read many books and watch many movies to recognize standard things as cliché.There is nothing wrong with clichés. They make up our entire life. We learn from them as young adults.I am a 45 years old male and I enjoyed this movie as I would have enjoyed it in my teen years.It had no ups and downs or surprising twists, but it also didn't bore me for a second. I just liked to watch the protagonists going through their lives and the story being unfold.It is a solid movie with incredible visuals, sympathetic characters and a nice story.It has no explosions, but it is still better, than all transformers movies altogether (which are really really bad), so if you like nice movies with a little bit of message, which just let you forget your problems for two hours and just let you enjoy the mood, then watch it.If you like post-apocalyptic settings, even better!","

"Divergent","j-lindsay-sens","13 October 2014","Overall, this movie clearly had a targeted audience, teen girls. The movie itself is not a bad movie, but i am not in its target audience so i didn't enjoy it that much. The music was teenie, acting was average at best, plot was mostly predictable and very easy to follow. The story line is stupid...splitting everyone its factions, ya cause we all know that wont cause problems and power struggles. I never read the book, but the movie had major holes and it was almost hard to watch. There was minimal action and comedy and it was mostly about teenage problems:fitting in, hot ""bad guy"" guy and such and such...Unless you are a teenage trapped in a adult body, this movie is below average, but it could be worse.I've seen worse, but I've seen a whole lot better","

"Divergent","romaniederreveaux","29 September 2022","I had to watch this movie in school. But I can't deny that, although it's not my style, it's all in all a very nicely worked out film. I think this film is also the most beautiful film in the entire DIVERGENT series.It is a typical SCI-FI film and that brings with it the necessary special effects. I think the color palette of the film is very dark, but that also ensures that you can fully empathize with the story. Only some things are slightly less visible on a large screen.Some things in the film can encourage young people to do stupid things, such as jumping on trains for example. I have no idea why this is being shown in schools, probably just for the hype.","

I thought this was a stand alone movie but checking IMDb they are making 2 3 and 4 in the same ilk as THG /facepalm.I also have another issue with the rating on this movie I have just read through loads and loads of user reviews on IMDb for this and there are 3 6's maybe 2 or 3 over 6 and hundreds of 3 or less scores but the score on IMDb is a 7.1????? how does that work???? 95% of the reviews for this movie are terrible and rate it really low but it's getting a 7.1???? Anyway it just shows how strong the teenage girl market is because this is squarely where this film is targeted. The rot set in with twilight then the hunger games jumped in behind and now this. Well I'm this is going to make a lot of rich studio execs even richer GUYS YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THAT YOU CAN SPEND STOP MAKING THIS CRAP!!!!","

"Divergent","mmaq63","24 March 2014","I'm a 19 year-old female and yes, I've read Divergent and am currently on the third book in the series. It is honestly one of my favorite book series'. With that said I'd like to say that I was wary about seeing this movie at first because I had heard some bad things about it, but I figured it couldn't be THAT bad. I was wrong. Before the opening credits had even finished, I knew I would be disappointed.1. I realize that it's hard for directors and writers to fit all of the events from the book into a 120-ish minute movie, but I just can't comprehend how they concluded that this would be the best way to execute the story. Key events were missing and/or changed. Many characters that play an important role in later books are completely cut from the movie, thus probably resulting in more plot/event changing in later movies. Basically a movie with the same name and some similar characters to Roth's book, but other than that, almost nothing in common.2. Watching the movie, it felt like the actors were trying too hard. The whole movie seemed quite superficial and all of the characters were unbelievable. They were saying their correct lines but it just didn't seem genuine at any point, probably because the writers were rushing to fit everything into the time limit. There were a lot of very cheesy moments that made me roll my eyes or cringe at how awkward they were. Four (Theo James) was probably the most believable character. And that's being generous. I suppose it's not the cast's' fault for being given what they had to work with.3. It was way too easy for the main characters. Tris gets kicked out of Dauntless, goes to the train and just is invited back in without a second thought. Then at the end Marcus just happens to know where the Erudite are controlling the simulation and when Tris and Four are trying to stop Jeanine there just HAPPENS to be a serum and injector right by Tris and Four?4. The movie seemed way too rushed. It was like the writers were trying to fit a whole story in so they wouldn't make book fans angry, which was completely pointless since half the story was changed anyways. Tris' mom and Will both die, Tris finds her dad and other surviving abnegation, Marcus knows where the Erudite are controlling the Dauntless and four of them randomly leave the other abnegation without any explanation to break into the Dauntless headquarters that they automatically find and stop Jeanine all in under 10 minutes. At least the directors found a way to squeeze it all in...? I can't even imagine what it would've been like seeing this movie without having read the book. Too many questions were left unanswered. I could barely keep up and I've read the book. So many important plot points or ideas were never touched or explained in the way the book does. We never get to actually become attached to any characters so by the time Tris' parents both die I couldn't bring myself to care. At the same time it felt painfully slow. When the movie finally gets to the ""good"" part (when the mind-controlled Dauntless invade Abnegation) I was more than ready to leave the theater and pondering what I'd be having for dinner.5.The relationship between Tris and Four did not seem real at all and felt forced. throughout most of the movie Four is being a complete asshole (more, in my opinion, than in the book.) to the point where it seems completely unlikely that he and Tris could ever be anything even close to friends and then all of a sudden he wants to let Tris inside his head, randomly kiss her, and then hold hands going off to battle before the finale scene were he and Tris exchange ""I love you""s. It happened way too fast for it to be a real relationship. This movie really made me appreciate the slow-churning romances in hunger games and even the vampire-werewolf love triangle movie that must-not-be-named.My advice is that if you're ever planning on reading the books (which I highly recommend) DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE FIRST. This confusing, rushed, unrealistic movie ""Based on the book series"" will probably discourage you from reading the books. Overall I really don't see how they are going to make a second movie anything like the second book. Hopefully they'll go the twilight/Hunger games route and get a new director for the second movie. Or maybe just forget they ever made the first.","

"Divergent","PlugInYourBrain","4 August 2014","Divergent is a pretty movie. The CGI of post-apocalyptic Chicago is very nice, but the plot has too many holes which keep breaking the suspension of disbelief. The underlying premise had potential but is not explored. Instead we spend most of the movie being bored in The Pit and screaming ""You Idiot!"" at the film's heroine.First, lets get the comparison to Hunger Games out of the way: Yes. Divergent is a rip-off of Hunger Games, but Hunger Games is itself a rip-off of Battle Royale. At least Hunger Games is entertaining. Divergent is kind of dull.Divergent is YA fiction. I'm not it's target audience. Perhaps that is why Shailene Woodley's Tris doesn't do it for me. I don't identify with her character, and she does so many stupid things I can't root for her either. I know she can act, but her performance here is flat. Tris is a whiny teen. Worse, a whiny teen who kept on doing stupid things. When a terrified Tori (Maggie Q) tells her to shut up about being divergent, she doesn't take the hint. When Kate Winslet's Jeanine told her she knew her tests results, instead of bluffing she blurts out 'You know I'm divergent? Wow! I am so dead!' (Not her exact words, but close...) And when she fights, she doesn't fight back and gets K.O.ed. The movie is filled with moments like this which had me screaming ""You idiot!"" The faction system is criticized as unworkable but that's okay because it's a valid premise that hundred year-old oligarchs dreamed up a political system that doesn't work and it takes a while for that to be recognized. But its problems are immediately obvious to the viewer. Any system which divides people into factions, each with different privileges, is bound to cause envy. There's open tension between the groups. We see a Candor (lawyer) openly accusing Abnegation (cleric politician) of stealing. Erudite's (intelligstia's) campaign to overthrow Abnegation is well known. If it's a perfect society, why do they need Dauntless (paramilitary) to keep the peace or candor (lawyers) to resolve disputes? And what about the large numbers of factionless living like the homeless, instead of moving into the many abandoned buildings around the city? And any American who sees that only one faction has the right to bears arms will raise an eyebrow. And who does the cleaning and chauffeuring?These problems supposedly are in the source material, but the movies writers should have patched those up.Too much of the movie is spent in ""The Pit"" of the Dauntless faction. When we first saw Dauntless they looked like an interesting crowd: happy paramilitaries who jump, leap and somersault and are generally in a good mood. If utopia must have a police force, these would be a good choice. But once we get inside, they're just another soulless army.Now if Dauntless had been the jumping, leaping, somersaulting Stomp-boys we saw at the beginning, Tris' journey could have made an interesting story.In boot camp there are five guys who looked so similar I couldn't tell them apart.The on-screen action is poorly directed. Teenage girls might not pick this up, but the teenage boys raised on first-person shooter games forced to watch this movie with them will: Gun battles consist of standing in the open and shooting. No teamwork or cover. Tris' Mom comes to get her alone: rookie mistake. And when her Dad attacks some bad guys instead of using cover, he walks to them shooting and gets shot himself. That's not a noble death. When you're only five and they're hundreds, fighting by attrition is stupid. And even though her Mom is supposedly a crack ex-Dauntless soldier, she also fights and dies stupid. When Tris flees, she hides with her back to a glass door facing the street. Imagine every gamer in the audience by reflex hitting the imaginary fire button on their cinema seat...Particularly grating is one action scene where a drugged fellow recruit stumbles towards her shooting... Tris keeps calling for him to stop, and he keeps shooting... and missing at point blank. Eventually she shoots him. But really, she should be dead. This is really bad direction from Neil Burger who bought us the fantastic ""Limitless."" (What happened, man?) Most grating of all are the end scenes. While the Dauntless prepare to execute the Abnegation faction Holocaust-style, Tris keeps looking around like a wide-eyed idiot. And then having beaten the Erudites, instead of pushing the advantage, she turns tail and runs. When Jeanine wakes up she'll finish what she started. And if the Dauntless infantry would now refuse that order, why leave now and give the Dauntless leadership the opportunity to reassert control?It was the biggest of all the plot holes, and it's these which killed this movie.I liked Theo James as Four, but Shailene Woodley just wasn't right for the role. The film's production poster, emphasizing her butt, is unintentionally comical.The plot holes could have been fixed, if the movie producers had been brave enough to ""diverge"" from the book. But for unfathomable reasons the book series is popular. Why mess with a working formula? They made a dumb movie from a dumb book. Sequels are assured. They will make a lot of money out of this. The studios got their wish. The fans got their wish. And the rest of us will watch it anyway, just to see how it ends.The soundtrack is VH1 weak. Hans Zimmer is ""Executive Composer,"" whatever that means.The romance is cheesy and not convincing.The real crime here is with a better director, better screen writers and better casting, this could have been a classic.","

I know this is fiction but the story sounds plain stupid. People are split into factions? Its as if everybody's brain went through some mutation and they lost their human nature itself. Don't care how it is explained in the book, but its not explained in the movie at all. Very bad story, average acting, full of clichés, very slow.Even if the books are not as bad as the movie, the adaptation totally failed. Lord of the Rings was made out of a book. I never read it but look at that movie. That's how you make movies.Absolutely not recommended. Sheer waste of time.","

"Divergent","isabelle-frater","3 August 2014","I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch this movie. The book is on my ""never read"" list, mostly because I heard it has a lot of romance in it with insta-love, which I can't abide. I was afraid that the movie would be like that as well. However, I have had a movie change my mind about reading the book, twice actually. Therefore, I decided to give this one a shot.I've heard the story compared to The Hunger Games more times than I can remember. Funny thing was that it reminded me of a whole lot of other dystopian novels, and even some non-dystopian ones, but not The Hunger Games. The factions remind me more of the houses in Harry Potter. Especially because the houses seemed to stay with them even after they left them. The difference is that Hufflepuff is divided up into three aspects of the Hufflepuff mentality, which in a way doesn't make sense, but it does if you think in the terms of jobs. The only people we're missing are the Slytherins. The problem with factions and houses is that no one fits only into one category. You may be more like one, you may want to be more like one, but no one can be defined by just one trait. Houses have been criticized because of this, but people eventually leave school, though the house they were in remain as a part of their identity. Factions you can't leave, therefore they are worse.The world building really doesn't make sense in some ways. I'm not sure if it's better explained in the books, but there are definite holes. So my questions within the first 10 minutes of the movie were:What is the wall for? - What is the rest of the world like, and why isn't anyone trying to find out? - Why are there still so many houses with holes in them? Shouldn't they have been repaired by now or torn down? - How long ago was this war thing, and what are the general facts about it? - What are the Gryffindors, sorry, Dauntless protecting people from? It feels more like they're trying to control the people who like to climb on walls for no apparent reason, and don't know that there are mountains in the world. - Later, one thing that I didn't get in the last 40 minutes of the movie was Tris' mother. Was it better explained in the books? The movie made no sense.The beginning was actually quite good. While the world wasn't established well, the personality and life of Tris was. Then it got boring really fast. The whole training, the drug induced illusions reminded me of Ender's Game. I was equally bored there as well. Good thing that this time I had cooking lunch to occupy the 90% of my mind the movie wasn't engaging. Things only started to pick up an hour and a half into the movie. Some aspects also reminded me of 1984. While the threat from outside wasn't specific, it's not unlike the war in 1984, which I always thought didn't actually exist. Also the whole drug thing, that I won't spoil further.The ending itself was kind of anti-climatic and annoying. I am half tempted to pick up the second book just to see where they go from here, but I was so bored for most of the movie, the jury is still out on that.I almost forgot to write about the actors and the characters. That in itself speaks volumes. While Tris was well established, I didn't find her someone I could cheer on. I'm not sure if it was the actress, or just the character. Shailene Woodley I've never seen in a movie before, therefore I would not be able to judge her acting. However, as Tris she just didn't feel much engaged in the whole story. It felt more like she was stumbling from one event to the other. Her smiles felt lukewarm. Kind of like Kristen Stewart, which is not a good thing. However, it could just have been a bad director, or the story itself. I would need to see her in other things as well to see if I like her as an actress. Theo James is hot for sure. If he was my instructor I would have wanted to get into his pants too. But love? I didn't feel the love connection between the characters. I generally don't like mushy romance, but a bit of building up would have been nice. The character of Four didn't feel well-rounded either. He was more like the convenient guy that can be the love interest.Are the books coming off my ""never read"" list? Not sure at this point. I may find my curious nature not being able to let go of wanting to know how this thing ends. This is partly why I tend to go for finished series. I hate waiting. The movie itself gets two stars for interesting beginning, boring long middle, kind of picking up ending.","

"Divergent","clement-959-542917","27 March 2014","If it were not for the few action scenes and the obvious will for the unknown part of the cast to finally break trough in Hollywood, this rating would have easily been a 2.Divergent has been the online hype for the past six months, and there is honestly nothing that stands up to whatever buzz it has created. It is a demoralizing vulgarization of master pieces like 'A Brave New World'. Except it has been very unfortunately mixed with 'Twilight', 'The Hunger Games', and that it now lies somewhere between bad and worst.To think that experienced and successful actresses like Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd signed in to co-star with a whole bunch of TV stars - mostly big screen wannabees - on the basis of such a terrible scenario is pretty self-explanatory in itself: Divergent has only one objective, and that is to create a cash cow like the other recent teenage franchises.It could be called sad, but in the end, there is nothing wrong with doing money. The only problem nowadays is that poor writers just loot their plots from inspiring master pieces from the past. With Divergent, Hollywood keeps on being Culture's Tomb Raider.Actually, it is sad.","

"Divergent","ace_nair","4 August 2014","Divergent is a science-fiction dystopian action film and the first in a ""trilogy"" series of 4 movies. I seriously don't understand why the 3rd story has to be made as Part 1 and 2. This knocking off of the final adventure of Harry Potter by The Hunger Games and now this is a lame attempt to stretch a story to make money. Anyways, on to the movie. Spoilers alert! In the distant or not-so-distant future (I couldn't understand from the movie the year it was set) in Chicago, society has been divided into 5 factions depending on a person's particular trait -Selfless, Peaceful, Honest, Brave, and intelligent. At the age of 16, a youth undergoes a test to determine if s/he would continue in their born-into faction or are they better suited to another. Also, a person can choose another faction s/he deems themselves to be more aligned to.The protagonist of this movie marvel is Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) a selfless tribe member, who discovers that she has multiple traits and therefore a ""Divergent"". She however chooses to join the ""brave"" ones. The movie then moves to testing her mental and physical character for her tribe and how she climbs up the ladder.In a later mental simulation game, her divergent abilities are discovered by one of the training leaders named Four (yeah, four) but he has the hots for her and advises he to think like their tribe members. Ah, almost forgot Beatrice is now Tris. Then you have the usual ""one group is trying to take over the other"" and only someone who has just been trained can save the day. A lot of confusion and mayhem follows and after 48 hours I don't really remember what happened except that I woke up.Theo James as 'Four' is so wooden, Kate Winslet should have used him in Titanic to rescue Jack and Rose from the icy waters. Ashley Judd, Ray Stevenson, Tony Goldwyn, Kate Winslet, Jai Courtney and Maggie Q add to a nice cast, but they hardly have any major impact with the viewer. My guess is Judd and Goldwyn (likable actors) were present so that their deaths could mean something to the viewer as we clearly know they will die and don't care one way or the other.Overall, the movie looked very muddled to me and I wonder if the sequel, Insurgent, will be any better as they are trying to release the movie in a year's time without having a proper script and director ready. As of writing this review, the sequel doesn't even have a Wikipedia page. So go figure.My rating for this movie is 5 on 10 It was nice to see Ashley Judd on the big screen, even though very fleetingly.","

"Divergent","ledesmaryan41","4 April 2014","How on the face of this planet did this movie get 7.7 if you've ever read the book you will find the amount of changes that take place throughout the movie compared to the book is nearly unbelievable I almost got up and left the theater in the middle of the movie there was so much changed the only resemblance to the book was the most basic plot line. Did Veronica Roth not watch the movie before it was released because what the hell was that if I were her I would be embarrassed to claim that as the movie version of my book. I could screen write a better version. If you haven't read the book I would suggest that you go see it and tell me I'm wrong because you're just gonna say that anyway and talk about how much of a good movie it was and and how I couldn't do better and all this crap or you could be less of a mouth breather and actually read the book before seeing the movie and then not sit through the 2 hour 20 minute monstrosity.","

"Divergent","stevendbeard","21 March 2014","I saw ""Divergent"", starring Shailene Woodley-The Secret Life of the American Teenager_t.v., The O. C._t.v.; Theo James-Golden Boy_t.v., Underworld: Awakening; Ashley Judd-Olympus Has Fallen, Kiss the Girls; Zoe Kravitz-After Earth, X-Men: First Class, and oh yeah, she is the daughter of Lenny Kravitz & Lisa Bonet and Kate Winslet-Contagion, Titanic_1997.This is another one of those movies that is based on books aimed at teenagers-think 'Hunger Games', 'Twilight', etc., so you can expect sequels. The story takes place in Chicago in the not-too-distant future- I don't remember them mentioning a specific date. The world is divided into five factions,based on their personality traits. Abnegation is for selfless people that do anything for anybody, without expecting a reward-think boy scouts. Dauntless is a warrior clan that police the city when they are not thrill seeking by jumping off buildings and moving trains. Erudite is the really smart people. Candor is the totally honest people that never lie-great politicians. Amity is the pacifist people-think latter day hippies. When kids reach a certain age, they are tested to see which faction they will become a member of. Shailene plays a young girl that has to pick her future path, and like lots of teenagers, she just can not decide. She doesn't fit into any one faction and when that happens, you are called Divergent. But, being Divergent is highly frowned upon-it can get you banished or even killed-so Shailene keeps it to herself and joins the Dauntless. Theo is her trainer, and maybe future love interest? Ashley plays her mother. Zoe is a fellow recruit and Kate is the leader of the Erudite. FYI: At my theater-AMC- they were passing out little bracelets with the five different factions printed on them-I even had a women offer to buy mine from me before the movie started so that she could give it to her granddaughter. I kept it. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and sexuality-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 19 minutes. I have never read the books but I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu- Ray.","

"Divergent","facorread","26 August 2014","A faction system makes this film look like an role-playing game. People in it are one-dimensional, boring, and all undeveloped. The film focuses on Dauntless faction, whose members are presumably the only ones in the society who are capable to handle weapons, engage in combat, jump, board moving trains, and do other irrelevant stunts. Dramatic music is the cue to the viewer that this faction is the cool posse to aspire to, and the other factions don't matter.In this scenario, the title ""Divergent"" leaves no space to spoilers: Girl doesn't know what faction to choose, but obviously she will not choose the same faction as her parents. Her aptitude tests are inconclusive, she applies to Cool Faction Dauntless, she competes for a position in it, and guess what? she earns a position. You know that even before she makes her first appearance on screen. Here is the big non-spoiler: after a while, the ""Divergence"" causes something that shakes the foundation of society and the very factions system.What is this film trying to achieve? It's not a visual experience, not a dramatic experience, not a political statement, not a comedy, not a sports film, not a sci-fi film, not a film for young adults, and definitely not an action film. Some people could be easily fooled by this film trying to be all of that, but the end result is a predictable, boring film, devoid of any credibility or chemistry.The film tries to explore personal identity through a system of factions. Nice try. It ends up conveying the message that if you like sports and combat, then you should not go to university, because they are mutually exclusive. If you are generous and caring for people, then you are a coward and cannot be part of the armed forces because these are mutually exclusive. Even if that was true in real life, the film is also an indication that factions do not need each other to survive. These premises are so stupid that producers are tacitly shamed into leaving the faction system unused and irrelevant.The film also tries to explore the value of choices, but guess what: the central character makes random choices without any motivation and without assuming any consequence of her actions. It's apparent that the premise ""Faction before blood"" isn't part of the culture in the film, to the point that people wimps for their families after they chose to leave them out of free will.The most dangerous message in this film is: individualism is a threat to peace.","

"Divergent","kuuk3","4 April 2014","I love films set in the future, but this film had nothing futuristic about it. It may have well have been set in 1940 as thats the level of technology you see in this world.I have not read the book, but this film was boring. For over two hours your watching nameless kids go to school. But nothing happens! There are no student rivalries, no interesting characters that set them apart, no class clown. Every character was EXACTLY the same and none of them did anything unique or memorable.If there was a villain, i didn't see him or her in the 100 minutes i watched it before walking out. It was just a bunch of kids attending class! Even the teachers were kids. Adults don't even exist in this world for longer than a few seconds every half hour.No explanation was given about the war, the world, the wall. The class factions might have been benefited by a sixth faction called 'builders' that actually tried repairing all the buildings in that city. As it stood, there was no-one around to build or repair anything. The whole mystery about 'divergent' was barely touched in the time I watched it, and I had given up waiting for answers when I walked out. It lacked any likable and interesting characters, any resemblance of a plot other than completing high school, it lacked a villain or conflict of any kind. Story-telling 101 was ignored completely and the only thing that gave the rating an extra star was the cinematography and panoramic views of the destroyed city which impresses well for a few seconds, before being ruined by the characters getting in the way of the camera and blocking our view.","

How far will they go with black and blue suits, shinny metallic interiors, simulation within simulation narrative, ah we want to overthrow the powerful and everything is deserted, but we are cool and sexy, no matter our acting is getting worse and worse.

"Divergent","sdr2017","11 May 2014","Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the Divergent Series. I am currently reading Insurgent. I was excited when Divergent became a movie. Since the book was amazing I had high expectations. Sadly my expectations were not met. They had skipped many important plot points throughout the film. A few examples are why Tobias is called Four, the back story of Tobias (which was only briefly mentioned in his fear landscape), when Tris is caught by Eric after going to the Erudite compound, Peter feeling up and degrading Tris's body when they try to push her off into the chasm, for capture the flag they originally use paint balls, Christina grabs the flag, Tobias originally is the only person in the control room and he was the one to shut it down, and many more. The ending left out a great deal of conversation between Caleb and Tobias. Peter and Molly are made to look less violent and extreme in the movie. There were not many fight scenes which was disappointing. They also did not add a lot of scenes where Tobias and Tris start being close. The movie made their romance so sudden. The book is definitely a 9.5/10 but the movie lacked and strayed from the book thus why I give it a 6/10.","

"Divergent","baberchik","27 June 2014","From the first 5 mins of this soap... I mean ""action movie"" I just could not help but think about Hunger Games, and from then on the mind as if tricked by one of these ""now you breathe manually"" jokes kept looking for just those parallels. The nearly identical puppy love, dystopian society, excessive for-show violence and a pyrrhic happy end make this teenage girl-oriented flick a girl movie. I expect most of the high ratings come either from girls, or old lonely women, or men who got some great ... lip service... after bringing their GFs along to watch this as a reward afterwards. I usually like the general setting (i.e. dystopian, post-apocalypse) but there's just so much hello- kitty-glitter-spice a cook can put in a dish, and here he dumped the whole shaker in. Also plagued with a kind of soundtrack that would either be found on a teen girl's iPod or in a female oriented ""erotica"" movie. Did I say this movie is oriented on teen girls by the way? I can not stress this enough obviously. Even the rivalry depicted amongst the characters... even that is literally a direct copy/rip off from hunger games!I really want 139 minutes of my life back, but I don't think Hollywood does refunds. So, to the concerned potential viewer out there, know this: I sacrificed part of my life on the altar of cinema viewership, quite selflessly I might add, so that you can avoid wasting your time on it.

"Divergent","rannynm","28 March 2014","Based on the wildly successful novel by Veronica Roth, ""Divergent"" tells the story of teens struggling to find their place in post-war Chicago. Society is separated by factions based on personality traits and virtues in attempts to keep the peace and encourage the population to participate equally in maintaining a functioning community. When a person turns 16, she takes a test to determine what faction best suits her characteristics to help her decide whether she should stay in her home faction or move elsewhere. Tris, played by Shailene Woodley, is a modest girl from Abnegation, but her entire life is turned upside down when the test reveals something about her she didn't know was possible. She is a Divergent, which means she does not fit into any category, therefore cannot be controlled and is a threat to the system. With the advice of an older faction member, she is warned not to tell a soul or her life will be at risk. Young Tris then decides to leave her home of Abnegation and transfer to Dauntless, a fiery group of individuals that show no fear and protect the people. There, she has to learn to fit in and test herself physically and mentally, all the while guarding a dark secret.I really like this film. I went into it not knowing anything about the book trilogy so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was pleased with the outcome. The visuals are interesting because even though this film is set in the future and it features some advanced technology, everything is kept quite simple looking. There are, however, some flaws with the visuals and effects because at times it is very apparent that green screen is in use. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible. It features a variety of artist that I really enjoy and I've already downloaded music from the film because it is something I actually listen to on a daily basis which isn't the case with me for most motion picture soundtracks. My favorite character is surprisingly not one of the leads, but a supporting role. I like the character Will, played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes, who is a boy Tris meets during her training in Dauntless. Will is a sweet, kind-hearted person who is always very supportive of Tris and her friend Christina, played by Zoe Kravitz. He is very level headed and is someone you can always count on. I had the pleasure of meeting Ben Lloyd-Hughes and I think he is perfect for the role of Will. The rest of the cast works very well together. Shailene Woodley does a great job portraying her emotions and showing Tris's character development. She goes through quite a lot over the course of the film and Shailene is really able to embody Tris and show how she transforms from a timid, modest Abnegation, to a fearless young woman who is not defined by anyone or anything. The only problem I have with the casting is that Four, played by Theo James, is supposed to be 18 in the book series. However in the film, he appears to be in his mid 20's, since Theo is 29 years old. He does a wonderful job playing his character, but it makes the romance between him and Tris really uncomfortable. My favorite scene in the film is when Tris and the rest of the new members of Dauntless are heading back from playing a capture the flag like war game. They each strap up to a high-speed full body zip line that goes rocketing through the empty city. I think this scene is visually appealing even though it is very short and has really no importance to the film. The CGI and landscape in this scene is just well done. Since I have not read this trilogy, I was a little let down with certain aspects of the film. In ""Divergent"" the film, the whole movie is mainly Tris training in Dauntless and it feels like the plot takes far too long to develop. The last 15-20 minutes of the film is where the action and the conflict begin to happen and then the movie is over. I found out that this is how the first book is written as well, but as someone who has very little prior knowledge of the series, it seems a bit odd. The second thing that threw me off was that it seems as if quite a bit of the dialogue is taken directly from the book. This is something that fans of the book will love since the films stays so true to the novel. However, from my point of view, a lot of the dialogue does not translate very well to the screen and appears a bit cheesy and forced at times. Like I said, this is really only an issue for me since I have not read the series nor was I a fan prior to watching the film. Overall, I was entertained despite these points. I recommend this film for ages 12 to 18 or for anyone who has read the novel. The movie gets a bit violent during training scenes and towards the end but is nothing too bad and if you've read the books you know what to expect. Overall I give Divergent 4 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining and I'm already eager for the next installment in the series. Plus I and all my friends that saw the film have been quoting the movie non-stop and making ""Divergent"" references in almost every conversation, so it clearly left its mark on us!

From what I had seen, it was one of those films that I didn't mind if I didn't get to see it right away. But my sister asked me to go see it so I did. Surprisingly I really liked this one. Coming from someone who didn't read the book and wasn't really wanting the see the movie, it's really not as bad as people say. I managed to sit through it for two hours and enjoy the whole thing. I also don't like how people bash things and fans of things just because they didn't like it and with people nowadays that's exactly what I've seen from reactions to this series. To the point where people were calling people that liked it ""stupid"", really let's grow up now. As for the film it's not a bad story, I actually enjoyed the plot and they seemed to explain the story well for a novel-to-film translation. They characters weren't nearly as poorly conceived as I thought they would be and the acting was actually good. The cinematography was great as well. The ending was OK, but it didn't feel as though it left any room for a sequel, at least I couldn't tell that there would be another just by the ending to the film itself. I'm actually hoping that this series gets the other two translated onto the big screen as well. I think I might be a fan of these now.","

"Divergent","a236570","23 March 2014","This book to movie adaptation wasn't terrible, especially if your only knowledge of Divergent was from the trailer. However, faithful readers of the book will be sorrily disappointed. The movie follows our young soon to be hero Beatrice Prior as she tries to decide which faction to choose to live in for the rest of her life. In her world, society is broken up into five factions: Abnegation, Erudite, Amity, Candor, and Dauntless. Once an individual turns 16, a test is administered that lets you know which faction you should choose. Beatrice ends up choosing Dauntless after being told her testing results were inconclusive because she's divergent, and that's the biggest problem I have with this movie.In the book, this information is conveyed with the utmost importance. Divergence is serious, deadly serious. If anyone were to find out her secret, Beatrice would be dead on the spot. In the movie however, the divergent reveal is casual in comparison. In fact, everyone seems to know that divergents are being hunted, and the leader of this man-hunt, who also happens to be the head of Erudite, Jeanine, is all over the Dauntless compound. In the book Erudite's shocking involvement isn't discovered until much later, which allows all the other clues laid throughout the book to fall into place. In the movie, it's a given.I can understand that some changes need to be made for book to movie adaptations, but the changes made here add nothing to the story. In fact, they greatly diminish it. There is no longer the constant threat of being discovered a divergent, because the severity of being a divergent is so down played. Erudite's betrayal to Abnegation isn't a real surprise the way it's laid out in the movie, and Beatrice's Dauntless training doesn't show the harshness, cut-throat, and violent way situations were handled.There are many other finer points to be made surrounding topics like Four and Beatrice's relationship, Beatrice's relationship with her family, and much more, but they're too long to list. All in all if you haven't read the book, the only drawback to this movie is its length, coming in at just under 3 hours. If you're a fan of the book however, prepare to be disappointed, as this is a greatly watered down version of Veronica Roth's thriller.","

"Divergent","NicholasWSnyder","10 April 2014","If you see this because of Shailene Woodley, you have chosen the wrong film. She's a better actor than this. You have to give her credit for stepping outside of her comfort zone, but she's not Jennifer Lawrence here. I believe she has the acting chops to get there, but this film might have been attempting too soon for her. The movie tries to do a lot. Too much. An adaption of a huge dystopian world, a social commentary on class structures, a coming-of-age ""I'm different than most people but that's OK""-type story, and a boot-camp movie. There are some moments that are done very confidently and others that are not. The confident moments are the feel-good little victories, the action set pieces are excellent, the combat, the special FX, dystopian Chicago is very cool, and some of the acting is very good. Although I will say, the casting is better than the acting. The writing and acting are probably the least confident elements to this filmAs with many sci-fi and fantasy movies, the directors often focus on the cool or epic before performance and character. Or there's just too many things to think about and too little time to shoot that you have no choice. Either way, these characters were not as deep as they could have been. But you want them to be and that's what was frustrating.Divergent also suffers from the classic case of adapting but forgetting the essence of the book. It wasn't quite sure what it was, where it lies, who it is, why it exists. It feels like a producer's movie - let's buy the rights to a book, throw some up-and-coming stars on-board, and market it like the Hunger Games sorta, but not fully. But in the producer's book, it was a minor success, as it is making money. So success there. At any rate, I love this genre and I love original stories and adaptations. I wanted this to be good, but it just doesn't go there. I'm glad it's doing OK because that means more original-ish content will continue to be made. And to Shailene Woodley, props for trying something new. But for now, stick to the Fault in Our Stars.","

Obviously based on the Hunger Games (factions, teenagers fighting) this film takes all the good aspects of that film and copies them very badly. The heroine, Tris is totally unbelievable. Unlike Katniss I couldn't see her winning a game of tiddlywinks let alone a knife fight. The evil government is a one dimensional stereotype that seems to exist in all this type of film and the inevitable romance between her and Four(??) might as well have been announced in the opening, it was so obvious. I will admit that the book is a thousand times more interesting than this drivel and the main reason it fails is because unlike Maze Runner, which has solid characters, and Hunger games, which has the brilliant Jennifer Lawrence, Divergent is just a mass of clichés and bland performances. Do yourself a favour and give this a miss.","

So, what was missing in this battle of hopelessness against, 'The Man', 'The Collective', 'Lord Business'or whatever it was? Maybe a catchy tune? How about,'Everything is Awesome' – oops – already used in a similar flick. And that would also mean plastic Batman is out too? How about a unique plot? Really - why? This plot needs to be copied a thousand more times, just so we can say there is an even two-thousand similar movies wandering around. Oh and the main character is a girl - who is snatched away from her family - and thrown into an insurmountable situationand this time she doesn't even have her bow and arrow? How crappy is that? Oh booger – I did it again, I mixed Tris up with Katniss. And while I am on this soapboxdid 'Divergent Girl' have a cape on, I wasn't looking? You would have expected it since she's got them powerful, mysterious and fantastic abilities. You know what they are. Yes, they are called Divergence so you best remember that! Knowing that, she should have had a cape – and maybe a giant 'D' splashed across her chest (I know, I am going for realism herejust go with it.) OK – OK, I am being way too hard on this movie it was actually fun and pretty enjoyable. Once again – I did not read the book, so casting did a fantastic job, the storyline was accurate (I guess) and the acting was superb (maybe?). I sat through the entire movie without nodding off (I consider that an honest assessment of the entertainment value of a movie). Bottom linegood movie, and I was entertained.","

"Divergent","schwartzdavid86","2 April 2014","Before watching this movie I looked at the ratings and choose it over other ones without second thoughts. 7.6 average, 45+ rated it over 7, the hell of a movie! Didn't expected a mediocre YA movie. The plot is not original, the actors are average, the effects both visual and audio below average, the action sucks pretty much, why should this movie get more that a 6? Teens choosing a different path from their parents one, how original. Getting tattoos, how daring. Playing capture the flag with some drug- paint-ball weapons... I could go on for long, but not as long as the movie did: 140 min of teens doing teens stuff. The movie itself could deserve a 4 cause was not really a disaster but I rate it 2 cause it was the worst movie I ever watched in theater and cause I expect much more from a 7.6 movie. More boring that going to church!","

"Divergent","gabbyJ_1","20 April 2014","I watched this for about 30-40 minutes before being grasped by startling boredom and being forced to leave the theatre to watch something else. A lot of things about this movie made me unable to watch it any longer, mainly I just felt bored by the performances of the main characters. the main guy and girl I felt I had no interest to watch at all. When compared to other big movies at this time like smaug or Robocop, I found this does not even compare to those movies. This movie is about rebelling against a system put into place for whatever reason, but it sounds like an attempt to control and enforce subjugation, and a few people have the fore sight to attempt to break out, the idea itself is not too bad it's the way that the movie goes about to implement this idea, through dream scenarios where you attempt to react according to a dream, but give me a break. How can you actually believe your even in a dream in the first place? The movie wants you to attempt this is possible by injecting you with a needle, I just found that to be absolutely absurb and silly. This movie fails to teach anything it uses a lame character build up and pointless romance to enforce this and i'm not buying it. I recommend don't waste your time on this one , unless your really really bored and are easily impressed with lame fight sequences and a cheesy story that has no back story and no explanation to enforce how any of this could ever be feasible. bbbbooorinnnggg.","

"Divergent","caseymoviemania","29 March 2014","Riding on the phenomenally successful adaptations of the first two HUNGER GAMES movies, it's simply a matter of time before Veronica Roth's best-selling novel trilogy (Divergent, Insurgent and Allegiant) is finally riped for big screen adventure. Out of the gate this year is the highly-anticipated first movie in a trilogy, DIVERGENT, which already positioned as the next HUNGER GAMES.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Set in a dystopian Chicago where society is divided into five factions based on five different personalities: Erudite (smart), Candor (honest), Amity (peaceful), Dauntless (brave) and Abnegation (selfless). Those who doesn't fit to any of the five personalities are declared factionless and they are equivalent of homeless peoples.However, Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior (Shailene Woodley), who belongs to an Abnegation family with parents Natalie (Ashley Judd) and Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) and brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort), discovers that she is a Divergent after being tested by a tester named Tori (Maggie Q). Apparently Divergent is classified as someone who fit into more than one personality, and could not be discovered by anyone or risk terrible consequences.When the day has arrived for a new group of teens to choose their own factions, Beatrice picks Dauntless. After the choice has been made, she has to undergo an extensive training period to become a qualified brave warrior within given time period. If fail, she will be kicked out of the faction and becomes homeless. As the training takes place, she slowly becomes friends with one of her drill instructors named Four (Theo James) and eventually falls for each other. Then one day she learns about Erudite, led by Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), is planning to overthrow Abnegation, the humble faction which currently rules the government.THE GOOD STUFFThe cast here is overall solid, with Shailene Woodley being the particular standout. As Tris, she manages to handle her first leading role with her engaging and soulful performance. Equally good is Theo James, who brings an unexpected warmth beneath his cool-looking exterior. In fact, both he and Woodley display believable chemistry together as eventual lovers.As for the supporting actors, Jai Courtney is perfectly typecast as the no-nonsense Dauntless leader Eric, while Zoe Kravitz is likable as Tris' closest friend, Christina. Maggie Q, who plays compassionate tester Tori, manages to make full use of her limited screen time to give a worthwhile performance. Last but not least is Kate Winslet, in her rare villainous role as the power-hungry Jeanine Matthews. Although her role doesn't flesh out well, she remains plausible enough to pull off her role with her steely-eyed expression.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The engaging knife-throwing scene (which is heavily promoted in the internet) where Tris is daring enough to step in front of the knife boards and tries her best not to flinch when Four starts throwing knives at her.THE BAD STUFFAt 139 minutes, DIVERGENT suffers badly from glacial pacing while the story -- adapted by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor -- feels bland and noticeably lack of sheer urgency needed for this kind of dystopian-thriller genre. Then there's the drab vision of dystopian Chicago which feels like a cheap-looking, B-grade movie. Overall technical credits here are disappointingly mediocre, while all the action sequences here (from fistfights to extended shootouts during the climactic finale) falls flat on the surface. It doesn't help either when the action is mostly ruined by shaky camera-work.To top that off, it's a surprise that Neil Burger's previous directing credits, such as the magic-themed period drama THE ILLUSIONIST (2006) and mystery thriller LIMITLESS (2011), who has a knack for showing versatility when tackling different genres, seems to be clueless directing DIVERGENT. I was shocked to see his direction here is terribly pedestrian and dare I say, lifeless as well.FINAL WORDSOverall, DIVERGENT is a waste of opportunity and a weak start to a potentially exciting new movie franchise. Hopefully, the subsequent two sequels (INSURGENT and ALLEGIANT) will show some improvements in the future.","

"Divergent","Hhkimes","20 March 2014","I have never walked out of a movie so mad at the cast and writers of a movie in my life. Divergent is my favorite book and I hate to see the plot literally slaughtered as I observed at the Thursday night premier. I cannot believe this is the book I love so much. Entire chunks of the plots were missing- and not subtle ones either. Very KEY EVENTS ARE NO WHERE TO BE FOUNS WITHIN THIS FILM. it is a waste of time to go see it in theaters. If you must watch it, I suggest just going to redbox or another rental place when it comes time for the movie to be released. And I am not trying to be that negative person that leaves bad reviews on anything and everything. Usually it is very easy for me to find the good in something but not in this. The mood of the movie was entirely different than it was in the book which disturbed me. The relationship between Tris and Tobias is very different than it is in the book which was something I could not get over. Along with the fact that the ending was completely changed. So basically, they spent a year on this movie to get the title and some of the characters names right. And everything else is wrong.","

"Divergent","drfinchsince1977","2 February 2015","This movie was terrible. Now I'll admit I didn't have high hopes for it when I saw the trailer but it was TV so I figured what the hell, I'll try it. That was stupid of me. If you liked the sparkling vampires of Twilight you will probably like this snoozefest, but if you are like me, and not a 15 year old girl, take my advice and pass.It's a bad story that's poorly acted. There is no chemistry between the leads, and no connection with them to the audience. It's just hard to care about them. The plot is thin and easy to figure out in the first twenty minutes or so, and the twist, if it deserves that description, will catch no one by surprise. I actually feel a little dumber after watching this movie. I've also lost a little more faith in hollywoods ability to make original and entertaining movies. I see this movie was based on a book. I would hope the book isn't as bad as the movie. If so, whoever read the book and thought ""What a great book! This should be a movie!"" and actually followed through on that thought needs to find a new line of work. This ain't for you.","

"Divergent","evanlyn","6 April 2014","Divergent is about Tris Prior, a teenage girl portrayed by Shailene Woodley, who lives in a futuristic dystopia that has been divided into five groups. These so-called factions are based on five values, such as bravery and selflessness, and are supposed to maintain peace in the society. Teenagers have to decide in which faction they belong and Tris is struggling with this decision. This struggle is later explained as divergence and happens to be a threat to the peaceful system of five factions – and so they have to be removed. Fortunately, Tris chose the warrior-faction Dauntless and so she has learned a few tips and tricks to fight those who hunt divergents. During her initiating-process, Tris meets Four, a mysterious Dauntless-leader who also seems to know about divergence and helps her hiding it from those who want to eliminate them.Shailene Woodley really captivates Tris's personality and she is inspirational. She portrays the lead character as a not-so typical heroine of the story. Woodley's Tris is relatable and she struggles with problems that teenagers today also struggle with. For example, they struggle with questions such as: Who am I? Where do I belong? What do other people think of me? In Divergent, Tris tries to find answers to these very realistic questions in a fictional world. This means that Divergent is both entertaining and it sets a example for teenagers who struggle with the same things as Tris.Also, Theo James' Four is very surprising. He too, portrays the male lead as the not-so typical male lead. Four has a solid character and James is not afraid to show the guy's flaws and difficulties. I find this so refreshing in comparison to other teenage movies that have perfect and very much unrealistic male leads (Edward, you still there?).Divergent is really consistent in its suspense. Although I have read the book and I knew what was going to happen, I still sat on the edge of my chair. For example, when Eric hangs Christina over the chasm because she gave up in a fight, the suspense was really killing me. What I also liked about Divergent, is the soundtrack and again, it is really different from other adaptations, because it is not cheesy and it is not based on semi-popular R&B-kind of songs. The soundtrack is well composed and really fits the atmosphere and the setting of the film.Unlike many, many other young adult adaptations, the romance in Divergent is mature and realistic. It is not mature in the way that Tris and Four have a lot of sexual scenes (one kissing scene and a lot of lingering stares, actually) but their relationship is mature, because it is based on mutual respect and trust – like relationships should be.Then, what did I not like about Divergent? Call me a nitpicker, but think that adaptations should stay as true as possible to the book and although Divergent succeeded in this more than expected, I was kind of annoyed by the way the Abnegation were portrayed. They are supposed to be selfless and vanity is absolutely not done, so can someone please explain to me why Tris and her mother wear that much make-up?!I also think that Four's divergence should have been explained better, because it was not explained in the film, at all. I am a big fan of the book and I am pretty sure that Four was divergent, but after seeing the film, I am not sure anymore. Okay, Four does not respond to the simulation serums at the end of the film, like a divergent should, and he explains how Tris can hide her divergence, but Tris and Four never really talk about the fact that they are both divergent and this really got me confused. I can imagine that someone who has not read the book, could be very confused about this.Divergent's biggest disappointment is Peter: he is pure evil in the book, but in the film, he just seems like this scary bully that pulls a big mouth when he thinks he is being ignored. I was so disappointed in Peter's storyline, because the film has this amazing actor, Miles Teller, who could have portrayed Peter so much better. For example, in the book, Peter stabs a fellow-initiate in the eye with a butter knife because he was ranked above him. This really shows how far Peter would go to defend his ranking and that Tris really has to watch her back. Unfortunately, this whole butter-knife-plot-line is not in the film and so Peter is nothing more then your neighbor- bully and that is such a shame, because Teller could made Peter so much more.Divergent is original the ever-flourishing pool of young adult adaptations and sets itself apart, because of two incredibly strong leading actors, a relatable story and mature and realistic romance. It is, however, not a true adaptation, in my opinion. Little details make or break a story and in the case of Divergent, the filmmakers could have paid a bit more attention to the details and important plot-lines.","

"Divergent","capone666","1 August 2014","DivergentIn most dystopian scenarios the human race is divided into two groups: meat and not meat.However, the futuristic civilization in this sci-fi film is split into five.Abnegation (altruistic) from birth, Tris (Shailene Woodley) was raised in a post-apocalyptic Chicago.On her 16th birthday, she gets to decide if she would rather be Amity (passive), Erudite (academic), Candor (truthful) or Dauntless (fearless).While she chooses the latter, her State aptitude test revels she is all five, and thus Divergent.Meanwhile, the head of Erudite (Kate Winslet) is using mind-control on Dauntless soldiers to eradicate the Abnegation. Based on the popular YA novel, Divergent mimics others of its ilk in terms of it hierarchical society and puerile romance; however, it deviates from the pack when it comes to its higher caliber of acting and directing.Incidentally, allotment in any setting - apocalyptic or not - is usually by someone's race.

"Divergent","samishoward","23 March 2014","Go see Divergent. See it if you have read the book or if you haven't. But especially if you've read the book. As a fan of the book I really loved it, and the friends I saw it with who hadn't read it also enjoyed it.I really feel that the Neil Burger directed film did Veronica Roth's book justice. It just felt authentic in bringing that story world to life, from actually being shot in Chicago, to many of the actors doing their own stunts, to the fact that it was perfectly cast. The changes they did make from the source material only improved upon some quibbles I had with Roth's characterization and plotting as a first time author, and made sense cinematically. Fans can also rest easy, because Roth was a producer, so she had a big hand in shaping this film. Shailene Woodley was a great Tris. She is a great actress capable of conveying a wide range of emotions, and she totally embodies the toughness but relatability that is Tris. As a heroine, I found that she's a very good feminist role model for girls. She holds her own the way a male lead in an action movie is expected to, and she defies gender stereotypes. Theo James is Four. He exudes masculinity, mystery, and fierceness. He and Shailene played opposite each other very well, and their chemistry was palpable. So if you're a fan of The Hunger Games, action movies, or the Divergent book series, definitely go to see Divergent in theaters. It's an action packed thrill ride filled with great performances!","

There are some pretty comments in this section that will tell you exactly why.I had some vegetable rice and watermelon for dinner, and I literally vomited in my mouth through the entire picture. This movie is sooooooooo bad I woke up with herpes zoster.How can this movie have a better note than Cloud Atlas for example?.....Do the people that casts this roles don't see that these actors CAN'T ACT? Do they not see that they have no facial expressions what so ever. Has no one read the script before they started filming this crap? I wonder who invested money in this flick, seriously dudes, get your money back, hire an attorney or something, because your investment was thrown away on a D series movie.Finally the soundtrack of this movie is THE WORST SOUNDTRACK of all times. I really think they googled ""free soundtrack"" and downloaded the result from page 32.If decent people exist out there please rate this movie with 1 star, and lets not allow flicks like this to pose as amazing movies.","

"Divergent","tegan-rayne23","4 July 2014","I am normally a movie person, but the book to this changed my mind. I couldn't put it down, I found myself getting lost in the story as if it was happening around me. I half wanted to see the movie and half did not, because I knew it would not be exactly the same as book. I was hoping that there wouldn't be a lot of significant changes to the story line. I felt that the casting was not thought out, a 30 year old Theo James playing an 18 year old, who is in a relationship with 22 year old Shailene playing an 18 year old Tris. Just looking at the two you can see that there is a large age difference but what makes the casting worse is that they don't have any on-screen chemistry. Many parts of the book that I thought were important were left out, starting with parts like the Aptitude test. Tori had to alter the simulation to put Tris in the bus because of her actions in the first part of the simulation she had only ruled out Amity. In the movie, she only goes through the knife choice and dog simulation. If the full part was in the movie it would explain a lot more.Tori's attitude in the movie seems quite hostile where as the way that I read the scene was that she was concerned for Beatrice's wellbeing. Many scenes were completely different from the book. In the book during initiation there is a Family day where family members have the choice of visiting their children if they have transferred factions. In the movie this does not happen. Tris' mum sneaks in and speaks to her in secret. Through-out the movie Tris has to encounter Jeanine first at the choosing ceremony and then in the Dauntless compound, while she's walking through the halls and other times like when she is doing her final assessment. This does not happen in the book. Most of the movies attack simulation scenes differ from the book. When the Dauntless soldiers take Tris and Tobias to Jeanine in her office, they argue about the need to create a new serum to control the Divergent. Tobias lunges at Jeanine. The Dauntless soldiers stop Tobias while Jeanine injects him with the new serum. The new serum is created to manipulate minds, and it does, Tobias reaches for Tris and strangles her. After the guards separated them, Jeanine sends Tobias off to guard the control room and sends Tris for her execution. Tris wakes up in a glass tank, after being hit over the head, which is where her mum saves her from just before she drowns. In the movie they take the couple to Jeanine but it doesn't seem like they are in her office, more like a filing room. There is a struggle and Tobias does lunge at Jeanine but he Jeanine just says to the guards to bring Tobias with them and to get rid of Tris. Tris is taken outside and made to kneel, which is when her mum saves her. In the book when Tris gets to the control room she finds Tobias on his own. She battles him, it takes her a while but she realises that she needs to fight the simulation because she will not win against him. By surrendering to him something in his brain clicked and he could see Tris. They stop the simulation and remove the simulation data. In the movie Tris finds Tobias tied to a seat, watching the screens which show the attack on the city, Erudite walking around, Dauntless soldiers on guard. He had been injected with the new serum, so when Tris set him free he attacked her. This is when they begin to battle, she does come to the same conclusion as the book, but in the movie Jeanine is in the control room amongst the other Erudite. Once Tobias came out of his manipulated state, he and Tris fight the soldiers in the room together. Jeanine runs to the computers to make sure the simulation is running accordingly, and Tris throws her knife into Jeanine's hand pinning it to the computer. Tris demands that Jeanine stop the simulation, but Jeanine refused. Tris thinking as fast as she can to stop Jeanine, see's a syringe and a vile of the simulation serum. Tobias grabs it and chucks it to Tris, which she uses to inject Jeanine. Once injected, Tris ordered her to shut the simulation down, which she did. The book contained a lot of dialogue which haven't been transferred to the movie, which removes context. In the book Four shouts at Tris while he is throwing knives at her head, the dialogue is simple but effective. This frustrates Tris and makes her more determined. As everyone else leaves the room Four tries to ask if Tris is OK, but she just shouts at him about the taunting, he tries to hint to Tris that he is being tough on her because he cares for her. In the movie, there's not a lot of conversation. Four doesn't say much to Tris while doing this, but he does ask Eric a question. When everyone leaves, Tris yells at him but unlike the book Tobias turns the conversation around to say that Eric wouldn't have let him stop if he hadn't have hurt her. In the book when Peter is being beaten in the initiation rankings by Edward, Peter stabs Edward in the eye with a butter knife. In the movie there is no mention of this, which I think is a mistake because he returns in the next movie. I wish I could re-write, re-cast this entire movie so that it was more like the book.","

"Divergent","grahambthomson-761-860939","13 April 2014","Having saw the film yesterday, it not great, it is not good, it is average. Some will say it's better some will say it's worse. The story is a little unbelievable but is packed full of action and drama. The problem is the action isn't great, and the drama isn't that exciting. Even the props had a feel of low budget or just not enough thought had gone into them. The actors were not great. The male lead was increasingly wooden and just seemed unable to dominate the screen the way his character should. The female lead was at times very good but she just didn't do enough for it to be better than that. Kate Winslet was good also but she was not involve nearly enough.Even with some good performances the film seemed a bit dull and obvious. Divergent is an OK film it's just OK, and that is its biggest problem it is a very safe very middle of the road sci fi film.","

Maybe if I thought the ""Twilight"" franchise was the pinnacle of cinema, I would think more of this film. In an apparent attempt to be ""Hip"" with the kids, the writers insert an inexplicable scene with a big Zip Line run which adds nothing to the plot. This sojourn is just before they all get their first tattoos. At this point I was waiting for all the principles to start uploading ""selfies"" to their Facebook pages. You get the idea.

"Divergent","gaussgoat","23 March 2014","As a parent who has been taken into some fairly painful movies, I wasn't sure what to expect with Divergent. I absolutely loved Neil Burger's Limitless, so I was really hoping that he was going to not inflict too much pain on me here. Fortunately for me, and very happily for my daughter, Mr Burger has delivered a solid film that, while it doesn't shatter any expectations, does a nice job of bringing the material to life.Divergent's strongest elements are the wonderfully actualized setting of post-apocalyptic Chicago, and the strength of the varied cast, particularly our young leads. Woodley and James do admirable work as the Heroine and Hero of the film, and I think there is some legitimate chemistry between these two. Burger does a nice job of understating things early on, but showcasing a growing bond between the two as the film progresses.There are some truly great moments on screen throughout. Divergent could have been an utter bomb with the amount of personal soul-searching that goes on, but through an admirable combination of pacing, character development, and fine detailed world building, Divergent never gets too preachy for its own good.There are a few weak moments here and there. The film definitely has a bit of bad-guy monologuing, and you have to wonder where the hell the scene that defined some nefarious back room dealings was, particularly with the star power in this movie. Some exposition at the end is a little uninspiring, and some of the plot is not what one would call a twist.Rough spots aside, the great moments well outweigh the bad. The movie also really steers away from any kind of brutal violence of any kind, as this is easily one of the best PG-13 movies I could recommend for parents in ages. In addition, Woodley's Tris is a wonderful heroine for girls. Tough, complicated, smart, and she doesn't give up.Go ahead and take the family to this one, you won't be disappointed. It may not win best picture in 2014, but Divergent delivers where it needs to and is definitely entertaining.","

I was hooked !I went to see the movie, and well. It's another Twilight, really. The pace is really slow, it all centers around an uninteresting love story, 100% predictable. The dystopian society don't make sense, and is pretty ridiculous : like hell people would live in 5 groups, mingle everyday, and be satisfied with the situation for 100 years.WARNING : SPOILER ALERT And come on, who says ""I don't want to go too fast"" after their first kiss ?Anyway, if you want a predictable movie, with cheesy dialog, really slow pace, boring love story and such, this movie is for you.I still rated it 3 stars, because to be honest, I laughed a lot trying to predict was what gonna happen next, and succeeding all the time.(Some people will probably say ""but, it's an adaptation from a book, so it's normal"", but then I'd replay : ""there are thousands of books around here that deserve a movie adaptation, why pick this one?""","

So I finally read the book a day before the movie come out to theater. I gotta admit that the books are awesome, the story is intriguing. And I cant wait to watch the movie. And then I went to theater to watch the movie. From the beginning, I have doubt about the cast. Based on the book, Tris' body should not be that big. And after the movie played, everything was falling into ashes. The casts are awful. I expect that peter would be someone who have an arrogant face, but instead.. Jainine, Kate winslet is an awful choice. Jainine should be played by Charlize Teron, or someone who have a typical face like that. And I felt that the casts are lack of chemistry. The story. Yeah I get it that it's impossible for a based-on-book-movie to have exactly same story like the book. I didn't expect that it would be this different. They ruined the whole story. Everything is changed. Its like I was watching a different movie with the same title. I came with some expectation that the movie wouldn't be as good as the book, because it always happened, but I shocked that they could for god's sake made it that awful. They have changed an awesome story into pile of crap.","

"Divergent","Pinhead88","18 March 2014","this is different from the hunger games. it has a different story. its about a divided society. the hunger games was about killing each other, this about adaption and finding your place in society, literally. it is fun action packed and has a better story {although not fully explained} is a fun ride that doesn't rely on melodrama for emotional effects. the hunger games films were good in there own right, so are these. so don't compare. they have totally different aspects and way it goes about things, it does what it wants, like the character in the film. these are simply fun and aren't supposed to live up to the hunger games, it was made to cash in yes, but it was also made to bring another brilliant story to the screen.","

"Divergent","muhammadalinajfi","19 March 2014","In my opinion, Divergent was fantastic and a must see-movie. Divergent is the most pure and honest movie based on a book I have ever seen. It does not remove almost any important scenes from the book and yet it still stitches the whole thing together to fit perfectly, and beautifully. It does this so well, that companions who haven't read the book still understand everything. It also made my friends want to read it; and though some of them did not want to start from the first book since they saw the movie, they started from the second and have not encountered parts which they did not understand. This is because the movie is so well made that they did not leave out anything in production, like most big production companies do. Divergent has action, adventure, romance, comedy, mystery, etc. It is the perfect movie to me. The actors are fantastic, and Shailene Woodley and Theo James rock the roles of Tris and Four in perfect unison. Divergent brings fans wildest imaginations to life, and flies the words of the book of it's pages.","

Divergent. I have not been this annoyed at a movie since...I guess Sucker Punch? 1. Most people would be ""Divergent"". a. Most people have multiple skills b. Most people have different thought processes (there are 16 outcomes on Myers-Briggs, not 5...and even 16 doesn't truly cover every person: and often people get different results at different times) c. Δperson/Δtime !=0 (people change) d. Additional reasons are an exercise for the reader 2. Drug touted to be little more than truth serum makes remote control people puppets. 3. ASSUMING most people were not divergent, there would be no reason not to want them. a. Divergents clearly are willing to follow the rules of society - their multiple talents do not prevent them from accepting this path. b. Divergents bring unique skillsets to their particular jobs that would otherwise be unavailable to a given Faction. c. etc. 4. Assuming most people were not divergent, what could have caused such a dramatic psychological shift? I _really wanted to like this movie, it was perfect in many ways, but the core concept was so flawed I could only hate it. Syfy originals have more meat to them than this garbage.","

"Divergent","lostonthehighway","11 April 2021","Divergent is another one of those movies which is trying to be what the Hunger Games was. And whilst the Hunger Games was a profound commentary on the media's treatment of humanity and touched upon important themes in society such as capitalism and profit, this was pretty much a shiny, plotless mess.Please note that this review contains spoilers. Additionally, what I'm about to say largely applies to all three movies, but I'm just going to talk about this one because I can't really be bothered to write the same thing three times.Alongside many others like it like The Maze Runner, The Giver, Ender's Game, Neuromancer, Gone, I am Number Four and Uglies (and their respective series & equally doomed movie adaptations, most of which I myself read and watched in their entirety as a pre-teen along with this), Divergent and its sequels was part of a literature movement dubbed as the YA dystopia boom. Most of the novels I mentioned above were pretty hit-or-miss (although the Giver will always have a special place in my heart for reasons I don't really have time to go into right now but you can read in my separate review), but the thing with Divergent is that it accidentally managed to spark the downfall of the entire YA dystopia genre.Right off the bat, you have what's pretty much the most ridiculous and pointless set-up imagined. Everyone apparently only has one personality trait, and having MORE THAN ONE PERSONALITY TRAIT made you tHe ChOsEn OnE. Wow, it's like Harry Potter crossed with the Matrix. Hell, I didn't get past halfway through the second book because I got so bored. You have the classic thing of Teenagers vs The Government™, and what's got to be the most boring, personality less protagonist who I've ever heard about (because she's GOT to be slightly determined, pretty and completely clueless so that all of our young female audience can relate since girls clearly don't have personalities).Unlike Katniss of THG, who had motivations and reasons to hate the government, who grew up in a difficult lifestyle, hunting because she was give no other choice, and who was repeatedly exploited for entertainment, Tris has, as I mentioned, no personality or motivations whatsoever apart from 'I hate my submissive family and those Dauntless guys are cool'. It's predictable, boring, has absolutely no romantic chemistry between Tris and Four, and nothing makes any sense.The reason I didn't rate this lower is that I did, at one point, love this series as well as everyone else in my school, and I've got to admit some of the action sequences are pretty cool. And it will retain my very generous 4/10 on a sentimental basis only.Anyway, don't watch this. Watch the Hunger Games instead.-Sasha.","

"Divergent","msjlpalo","25 April 2014","I'm sorry but I don't like it. I give it a 6 out of 10 stars. We all think that ""Hey!! This could be another series we could look forward to"" and this would be like the other successful series that have past. But I do not think so.Me and my siblings have a lot of side comments while we are watching the movie. I know this is in a dystopian era and we don't actually get the movie until the half of it. We don't understand why there should be factions and this looked a lot like Hunger Games. The blood thingy, where they choose the faction where they are going to be, another familiar scene... like in Harry Potter The Dauntless faction... they say they are not rebels and such... and this ""Dauntless faction"" reminds us of the Fire Nation in the Last Airbender.I mean, it is easy to get tired of these kinds of movies because they are very common now.And, Tris and Four?? Why the hell did we kissed? I mean, they just kissed and the romance went on... I mean, how did it happened so fast? There seemed to have no development between them through the course of the movie. Four is like this bully-turned-mentor guy who helped Tris throughout her stay in the Dauntless faction. And that's just it, I think I would like to see them as just mentor-student as for now. They should've skipped the ""love story"" for the next installment.I liked the whole concept really, but I think it is just redundant. Like we've already seen and heard this kind of story.I am really intrigued with this story and wanted to read the whole book series... but after seeing this movie. I just don't think that I would want to read it anymore.","

"Divergent","dariana-ro","23 March 2014","Unlike the first Hunger Games this one managed to make me get emotionally involved . My major complain is that the other initiates are just invisible , no time was spent to develop those characters and their relationship with Tris. If the other books are made into movies this will be a problem because some of those people have important roles to play . I sow other people complain that there is no sense of urgency and that may make the movie a bore . I think that this is caused by the fact that they wanted to get a good rating so there is a lot less death, violence and injury in the movie then in the book . In the book kids fall jumping from the train and a boy is mutilated to get him out of the competition.I agree they could have done a better job showing the pressure the character has to endure but it wasn't boring. If she fails to be accepted in Dauntless she will be thrown out on the streets and on top of that her life is in danger since divergents are killed .","

We both absolutely loved the movie. The movie Divergent is action-packed with very likable characters. I found the movie kept my attention from beginning to end, with some light moments, a bit of romance, and lots of excitement throughout. I'm a big Hunger Games fan and thought Divergent was every bit as good, and in some ways better.Based on our advice, my wife and 9-year old son went to see Divergent this weekend and both loved the movie equally as much.

My guess is they read the back of the book and thought that was good enough.How this made it to the theater like this is beyond me. They took out the visitation day and REPLACED IT with her mom sneaking into the Dauntless compound. Not only that, she never mentioned anything about going to visit Caleb or the serum. Little things that had a huge impact on these characters were missed. We never saw Peter stab Edward. Wait, did we even see Edward? Oh yes, we did for a brief moment during capture the flag. Speaking of capture the flag, according to the book I read Christina was the one who held the flag. Chances are you won't see me at the second or third movie if they make them.","

"Divergent","sarahxpiano97","6 May 2014","The movie was so bad. It was a good concept from the beginning, so on its own it may have seemed great to those who haven't read the book. If you have read the book, however, you would have noticed that more things were left out than kept in, things happened at way different times than originally, important and thrilling scenes where twisted resulting in unimportant and boring parts, and many characters, thoughts, and important phrases were almost completely left out. This is the first movie that I have ever despised. However, whether you believe the movie is good or bad, and you haven't read the book, please read it for your own good. It is honestly one of the best I have read. Things you missed in the movie: The hardcore ship you will have for Christina and Will and, obviously Tris and Tobias, so many intimate moments, the fact that Four is not called Four by Tris once she knows his name, how Molly, Peter, and Drew are complete and utter butt holes and you will want them dead as much as Tris does, and many more that I can't list because of the word limit. Honestly, just read the book, or listen to it.","

"Divergent","deadwitchflying","27 February 2015","I have incredibly low expectations when it comes to young adult movies, and yet, I'm still disappointed. Many of you claimed that it is really similar to the hunger games. Well... yes and no. Divergent is stupider.First of all : the credits are still rolling and I don't know why there was a war and why dividing people into five district... I mean factions is gonna help maintaining peace. This is BS. No explanations, nothing. And we meet our lead character Kat... I mean Tris (notice how Katniss and Tris sound similar) played by Shailene Woodley. And for me, this is the first mistake they made in this movie. Woodley... I just don't like her. Her voice, her face, everything.But the crap really hits the fan when you learn that not only is she divergent but that this is something rare... How ? I mean, have you ever been 16 and not knowing what you wanted to be when you grow up or is everybody in this lousy version of Chicago conditioned or something ? I call BS on this part. Being divergent is not something rare especially at the age the characters are. It's not, and this is why the movie makes little sense.2nd problem : the factions. How does it maintain peace to restraint people to one single way of living for the rest of their lives ? And what about the faction-less (or homeless. It's literally the same thing) people ? They don't care about their fate ? They don't want abundant food and a home ? I mean, they can build a giant wall but can't feed the poor ? How perfect is that ?3rd problem : choosing a faction is nonsense. They don't even get to ""try"" them. If factions really have to fit who they are, they should be able to walk in their shoes for at least 48h each. Instead, they are giving a false choice : either you stay home safe or you explore the unknown with the risk of being kicked out. Concretely : it would not maintain peace IRL.Final major problem : The chemistry between Tris and Four is fake. In one of the early scenes of the movie, Four gives her the most beautiful, powerful middle finger ever : ""What makes you think you can talk to me ?"" And she doesn't seem to remember it afterwards, and worst of all, they don't share that much special moments in the movie. Their love seems forced by the circumstances.So, the plot is nonsense, the character development is poor, and so is the acting. I haven't talked about the action sequences at all, but trust me, it's not worth mentioning. Finally, the climax is... unexpectedly bad and makes little sense. I'm trying to keep the review spoiler-free so go watch it for yourself and you'll know what I'm talking about.","

"Divergent","g-bodyl","4 March 2015","To be quite frank, I enjoyed Divergent. I tried to read the book, but I was never able to finish reading the book. The movie is a better movie than I thought. I honestly don't get the comparisons between this and the Hunger Games other than the dystopian futures and a strong, female protagonist. They are both different stories and I enjoy each movie for different reasons. This movie doesn't feature strong romance and I like the fact how there are factions based off virtues, which I find intriguing. There are some cool action scenes and I also enjoyed the pretty effective visuals. Neil Burger's film is about a girl named Tris Prior who was assigned to the Dauntless faction, or pretty much the army of the city. She has a dark secret in which she is divergent, or the ability to have all virtues. The government has a plan to wipe out all Divergents and Tris, along with the mysterious Four, must figure out why and how to stop them. I believe that the cast did an excellent job. Shailene Woodley is a good, young actress and she played her role very well. Theo James actually made for a good Four and of course all the girls would be all over him. Jai Courtney, whom was bad in the last adaptation of Die Hard, delivers a stronger performance as the leader of Dauntless. Kate Winslet gives a malicious performance as the head government leader. Other standouts include Miles Teller and Ashley Judd. Overall, Divergent is the beginning of what seems to be another profitable, young-adult franchise. I love the nature of the film and it is a better movie than book, which is often very rare. I was able to understand the concepts, thus making me more appreciative of them. Is this the best young-adult movie? Of course not, but I regard highly the value of it being fun and entertaining. I cannot way to see this story continue. My Grade: A-","

I watched this movie just because of a great review that was saying that the movie exceeded the expectations etc, but believe me, this film is full of clichés, don't recommend to watch it on the theater, maybe is better to wait to arrive on blue-ray, I think the movie was made for the teenage public, because of that you are going to see all the peaces that worked in other teen movies on this one, I am just doing this review to alert the people that really likes a well constructed film, with a good script and not intended just to win money.However there is a good part about this movie, if want to see something with your girlfriend, something that you don't need to pay much attention or something that you can take a nap and wake up, this a good movie to do so, I don't need to say much about it, just watch the trailers, if I had watched and just didn't believe in just one review of one person I would really chosen another film, bye and good luck!","

However, my one complaint would be that Tris and Tobias were a bit awkward on screen together they always seemed so sure of themselves within the relationship and they meshed perfectly, but in the movie it just seems awkward and like they are trying too hard to be together.","

"Divergent","sandyrfarmer","22 March 2014","*Spoilers for people who haven't read the books.* You guys...Divergent has easily been the best book to movie adaptation that I've seen in a really, really long time. Let me just put that out there immediately.The actors: Shailene Woodley (Tris), Theo James (Four), Kate Winslet (Jeanine), Ashley Judd (Natalie, aka Tris's mom), Jai Courtney (Eric), Zoe Kravitz (Christina), Maggie Q (Tori), and Tony Goldwyn (Andrew, aka Tris's dad) all did magnificent jobs. I felt like Shailene and Theo especially were perfect for these roles. They were both how I pictured Tris and Four while I was reading Divergent, and they never once acted out of character. Truthfully, that's hard to find. I loved the chemistry that Shailene and Theo had while Theo also maintained Four's standoffish feel through the beginning of the movie. They're relationship felt legit. Shailene's best acting scene was when Tris lost her mother during the Dauntless attack on Abnegation. I teared up during that scene because her grief felt so real. You guys know I'm not a crier, so that's a small victory in and of itself.As always there are differences between any book and movie made based upon a book. The biggest differences that I noticed involved the widespread knowledge that Divergents exist at all. In the book, the only people who seem to know about Divergents are those who are Divergent themselves, ones who have family members who are (or were) Divergents, and Jeanine. It was slightly confusing to me as a viewer why Tris didn't know any details about what being Divergent meant when the knowledge that Divergents exist at all was fairly widespread. I feel like the movie makers made this decision in order to help along the viewers who may not have read the books.I was almost sad to see how little screen time Al was given. I don't know that we'd even been told his name when the major events involving him took place. I figure his scenes were probably cut for budget and timing purposes, but I was sad that we didn't see move of him and his struggle to become Dauntless. Four tells us that he was failing, but even if they'd simply told us his name and flashed to his ranking on the scoreboard we could have figured that out. Similarly, Molly is shown and there are a couple of scenes with her, but I don't think we were ever told her name in the movie.Probably for me, the most deviations revolve around Jeanine. She was a lot more present than I remember her being in Divergent, but I'm assuming that's because you don't hire an actress like Kate Winslet and not give her any screen time. PLUS I imagine the bigger reason being that because Jeanine's so present in Insurgent, she needed to be firmly established as ""public enemy number 1."" Another addition the movie makers made but that I actually think made more sense involved the mirrors in Tris's simulations. It seemed to me like Tris being able to look at her own reflection for any length of time is what usually woke her up to the fact that the simulations weren't real. And I liked how the movie makers pulled that in from the first scene of the book and made Tris's relationship with her own reflection have a deeper meaning and purpose.However many deviations there were between the book and this movie, I wasn't upset with any of them. Everything felt so much better with Divergent than with the other book the movie adaptations I've seen recently. The actors. The locations. The special effects. The smart decisions on what should be changed and what should remain the same. The marketing strategy. The overall feel of the movie. They just did so much right with this adaptation, and I can't thank the director and producers enough for doing a worthy job of this book.I wanted to spend some time addressing other specific scenes that I enjoyed so much, but when I started naming them in my head I felt like I was essentially naming all the scenes. HA! This is definitely one that I'll pay to see in the theater twice, and I can't wait to see them make Insurgent since there's not a doubt in my mind that they will. Divergent gets 9/10 Stars from me. Have you seen it? What did you think? Let me know!","

"Divergent","TyRawrrnosaurus","20 March 2014","In a very quick introduction voice over by Tris we are told that after a massive war society was broken into five factions to ensure it never happens again. Why the war happened, who it was with, and how it ended is never discussed, but at least Chicago has a large security fence as tall as a skyscraper surrounding the city to protect against a giant T-Rex or something. Planes must not be an issue either because they could easily fly over the fence, but we never see any flown; technology in this world is used for guns, digital display panels, seeing into a person's dreams, and instant tattoos, not for rebuilding a more suitable world to live in - that would be silly.Tris was born within the Abnegation faction aka the just and loyal Hufflepuffs. Abegnation are the leading figures of government because of their selflessness. She lives with her mother Natalie, father Andrew, and brother Caleb who is also taking the aptitude test despite being older, which makes no sense per the rules stating 16-year-olds must take the test and choose a faction.Now that Tris is 16-years-old, she must partake in a process where she is told to drink an unknown liquid to determine which clique she belongs to. Based on her results, she may find herself fitting in with Dauntless aka the courageous Gryffindors; Candor aka the ready-minded Ravenclaws; Erudite aka the cunning Slytherins; or the last group known as Amity who just farm and have no real stakes or voice in the entire film.Tris' results of her aptitude test are inconclusive and discovers she is a rare breed known as Divergent. Those labeled Divergent can fit into any faction because they are capable of having more than one personality trait – explanation as to why everyone else cannot achieve the same level of basic human nature is not provided. Through a sorting hat-like process, after wasting time with an aptitude test that tells each teen which faction they should belong to, everyone is able to choose a faction, via a blood sacrifice, they'd like to shack up with for the rest of their lives.Luckily for Tris, her aptitude test proctor Tori allowed her to walk away despite one line of dialogue telling us Divergents are a threat to the system. Evidence to prove Divergents are dangerous to the way of life is never explained well enough to truly justify as a threat. So Tris hides her little secret anyway and chooses Dauntless because she would not want to become factionless, a nomadic people without a home who are not accepted into any of the five factions – doesn't that make them Divergent? While spending almost an hour through a rigorous training regime to prove to us she is the one, we are introduced to a love interest named Four (Theo James). Four is the eye candy until the main conflict presents itself almost two-thirds of the way into the movie; the Erudites want to overthrow Abnegation as the leaders because selflessness is too weak and not logical. Heaven forbid anyone should be able to think beyond their means.With a taxing two hour and twenty minute run time, Divergent is a complete clunker. The real grit of the story doesn't begin until well over an hour in and it isn't until the last thirty minutes that some kind of resolve needs to happen. Since I haven't read the book, I'm not sure if it is Roth's lack of imagination or the screenwriters Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor's failure to bring the book to life, but Divergent is absolutely devoid of any kind of world building to make this film stand out besides its loony way of assigning factions to its citizens. They even use the Chicago's L transit system to ride into Hogwarts, I mean Dauntless.Strangely, there seems to be no adults anywhere unless they play a small role in the plot, and yet there are so many kids running around. The bulk of the movie is focused on these kids and their plight to fit into Dauntless. Tris and Four's parents become a convoluted piece of the puzzle near the final act, adding little relevance, clarity, emotional depth, or importance. Janine, an Erudite and President Snow rip-off, is one of the few adults we get to know and acts as the main antagonist, posing as a faceless, unmotivated, and irrational villain.Thankfully, Woodley and James are able to have enough chemistry on screen to provide some redeeming qualities. Another case of beautiful people falling for beautiful people. Without Woodley, Divergent could not stand a chance. There is also a Ron Weasley-esque sidekick for Tris named Christina as well as a Neville-esque boy named Will.Visually unimpressive with an uninspiring score that does nothing to better the film's lack of a personality, Divergent struggles even on a superficial level. Even a larger budget than most YA adaptations can't set it apart from the rest. Sets do not feel lived in and the different factions are hardly explored, making the world even more unbelievable than it already is.Themes of discovering who you are, understanding your place in the world, and standing up for yourself are practically force fed, but in the final third of the film the moral teachings diminish and Divergent transforms into a popcorn action flick. Burger tries to materialize high concepts of freewill, totalitarianism, and the human condition, but misses the mark by focusing more on the romance and action than answering the bigger questions.Divergent is simple fan service at its best; it even ends so abruptly that no ramifications of Erudite's actions, Tris' Rebellion, or Dauntless' coup d'etat are mentioned. Anyone going into this movie without having read the books is going to end up confused or annoyed by the sheer lack of coherence.","

"Divergent","misha1998","11 April 2014","I will tell you something; I have not read the book, so therefore I cannot really compare much to the source material (my friends have stated that the source material is far better than the movie).This movies starts bad with an unoriginal explanation of a Utopian scenario, which we have seen before in The Hunger Games and read before in The Giver. I mean, when can we have a YA movie without dystopia?!After that we are given factions (which serves as a plot element) and then we find Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) as a stereotypical girl who has absolutely NO character (besides being obviously raised by her mother and father, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE) and then while she is in one of the factions (Dauntless) she starts to suspect from Four (Theo James) that some sort of coup'de etat was happening...I mean this is another case of ripping off Deus Ex! (the game)Another thing I would like to criticize is the tendency that you have to put music with extremely annoying singing in the movie that has absolutely NO relevance to the plot. I mean, I think the songs that were put in the movie were supposed to make one of those ""intended audience members"" happy because the executives knew that this film was not well made and forced the editor to put in this absolutely unnecessary music!Now, if you dare me to say something good about this, I shall in the following. The fight scenes remind me lots of Fight Club, the romance is actually built up lots, and the whole cinematography reminded me of Terrence Malick. And I did like one scene after Prior is ambushed by some thugs and then when one of them apologizes, she not only declines but she actually tells them to never talk to her ever again. That moment, for me was a huge show stealer. Unfortunately, for me, I cannot really like this film and I do not recommend it, but the film cannot be bad when a scene like the one I just mentioned plays perfectly.","

"Divergent","IliasManos","17 August 2014","Before start with the analysis, just to give a quick opinion for those who don't wanna spend much time reading: If you older than 13-14, don't waste your time. I am not quite sure how long has it been since I've seen such a bad film, and by bad, I mean bad. This movie has nothing. No photography, no costumes, no soundtrack, the direction is at best mediocre, and the storyline does not even exist. 1h45m of static, stuck and non- progressing plot, with the saving part at the end, saving the city in 10 minutes and that's it. First of all, whoever wrote this should be at least ashamed. A boring, blunt, cliché and repetitive classic storyline about a little girl that can not fit the society and wants to be different and not in types?? I mean, what is the target group here? 13 years old teenagers? Furthermore, the whole film has absolutely no sense. The main problem of the character is that she is not clearly oriented into a faction because she is intelligent, brave, has compassion and she's kind. What a nonsense. Further more into this, the acting is just terrible, like if someone would pick a random person and ask him/her to say these lines. Only exception is the death scene with the mother of the heroine where the acting is bad/mediocre. All the rest is not even acting. No dialogs, no strong scenes, not even one monologue, nothing. 2 stars only for the fact that this was not shot in a camcorder, and for casting Winslet (what was she thinking...)","

"Divergent","afiffifa89","22 July 2014","I have no idea how any sensible person can call this a good movie. What they actually depicted in this movie was a society following a Military Code of Conduct. Funny part was nobody had any idea what a military code of conduct was. It could have been a great comedy. But they had to make one absolute rubbish action movie. The whole concept of the depicted society is flawed. Our fear has nothing to do with our virtues. Testing someone's fear has nothing to do with what that person is capable of. People react differently in different kind of situations. Our motives drives us, not our fears.When 'Tris' started training, at the first day the trainees started questioning their superiors. They were like kids thrown into a pit with guns. Their superiors were also ridiculous, as even though they were trying really hard to keep the kids in line, they had no idea how. They forgot the thousands years of military rules that were created to keep soldiers in line and they were never really marching other than when they all became cyborgs like thingy. They were running around like kids in a playground, just this time the kids had guns with them and the normal civilian people was completely okay with it. Now let's come to 'Tris and her hypocrisy. First of all, she's the last person to b ever handling a gun. Simplest reason is she was supposed to b dead(like surely, as she was also running without cover and stuff a lot) three times in total in this movie. First, before killing her friend, who missed a shot at point blank range. second, when she was crying about her mother being dead. she dropped her gun, started crying and holding her mom and then asked the people who was shooting at them to stop. And those cyborg like humans were still holding their position and shooting at the wall, instead of making any attempt to go near them. I would expect cyborg humans(who are supposed to be fearless) to be a bit more daring if i might say so. And the third time, she got caught trying to free her boyfriend. They didn't had any use of her. And even if they did why not just shoot her. All those people were supposed to be goal oriented. Killing her with a simple bullet would've been it. But none of those people even tried to subdue her. So bravo for being the luckiest person on that whole place. About her hypocrisy, she was the one wasting time with her mother with lines like ""I killed him :'("". If she hadn't, her mother could have lived. Yet, after all she's the one who says to the other people that there's no time to waste. And then she had to get into the cool white room all alone, and had to try to do everything to get her boyfriend back again. Instead of just simply killing the people who were on their way towards a mass genocide. Which wasted more time? These are just some of of the major things i noticed. But there were many others too. So please broaden your mind and think how people can become so naive?","

"Divergent","zkonedog","28 February 2017","Whenever most books or films are made for the young adult audience, there are certain ""benchmarks"" that need to be hit in order to appeal to the target audience (e.g. attractive actors, romance, angst, simple concepts). While those benchmarks make those works extraordinarily popular for that target audience, they also limit the book or film's appeal to a broader population. That is why, at least for me (28-year old male), ""Divergent"" was just an ""okay"" movie.For a basic plot summary, ""Divergent"" tells the story of Tris (Shailene Woodley), a teenage girl living in a future society where each person must choose from a prescribed list of professions upon a certain date. There is an aptitude test that helps determine which profession one should tend towards. The trouble with Tris, however, is that her test comes up ""divergent"", meaning that her brain doesn't focus on just one of the areas. This is something that must be hidden, as it is looked down upon and may make her a danger to government officials like Jeanine (Kate Winslet). Choosing a profession that is somewhat surprising, Tris makes the transition to a soldier-type life, where she meets Four (Theo James), a superior who is tough on her but also shows an interest in her well-being.I liked the framework upon which the plot of this movie is built (I've never read the book, so I really can't make comparisons). Every high school student has taken a ""which career should I choose?"" test, so the concept is very relate-able. The whole ""what to do next in life"" is something we can all relate to, young adults probably more than anyone.The problem, though, is that ""Divergent"" tries to cram a lot of things into a relatively small (2 hours, 15 minutes) package. There's drama, action, romance, political intrigue, big ideas...a little too much to focus on making one or two areas really, really good. For example (minor spoiler ahead), there is one character death in the movie that is supposed to be a very sad, emotive moment. However, because the relationships hadn't been developed well enough up until that point, it just kind of falls flat.Contemporary films like ""Hunger Games"" and ""The Giver"" (both films that I enjoyed) do a better job of ""camouflaging"" the young adult aspects (though not omitting them, obviously) in order to appeal to a broader audience. ""Giver"" pulls not punches that it is a concept-driven film first and foremost, while ""Hunger Games"" (like the book series) doesn't get into the real angst-y, drama stuff until later on in the series. Thus, I felt like ""Divergent"" takes the action of the Hunger Games and the concepts of The Giver and combines them to produce...an inferior product of that melding.""Divergent"" isn't a bad movie but any stretch of the imagination. It has a decent plot, the action always moves forward, and drama is present. It just won't captivate audiences beyond its target range of teenagers.","

"Divergent","ChristianDrey","27 July 2014","Divergent. I have read the series already and I should say, this movie is one of those that actually exceeded my expectation. Exceeded in the sense that the movie's depiction of Chicago is better than what my brain told me. I just had a bit of a different take on Four and Eric but other than that, this is a great movie for the novel. I cannot wait for Insurgent.It could have gotten a higher rating from me if the story on the movie was more ""following the book"". Also, what I noticed on the story in the movie is that a lot of things, important things, are shortened and were not given enough attention. One example of this is the end part starting from the moment she shot Wil. I know things have to be changed in order for the movie to be not too lengthy that is understandable.Lastly, Kate Winslet is AWESOME! This, I believe, is the first movie I saw that she is in as a villain and my oh my she did Jeanine's character well. Exactly how I imagined her to be even better, I think.","

"Divergent","kluseba","25 April 2014","Dystopian teenie movies are all the rage these days. In my opinion, ""The Hunger Games"" and Company can't catch up with classics like ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""Rollerball"", ""Soylent Green"" and so on. ""The Hunger Games"" was already almost just a rip-off of the famous Japanese book and movie ""Battle Royale"". At least, ""The Hunger Games"" had a few great actors, stunning costumes and settings and loads of action. ""Divergent"" is now a rip-off of ""The Hunger Games"" series. My advice for you is to watch the originals instead of what Hollywood wants to be the next blockbusters.So basically, this is a rip-off of a rip-off. But ""Divergent"" features less impressive actors and actresses that portray more or less convincing characters. I could not connect with any of them but maybe the target audience of teenage girls would see things differently. The costumes and settings are much duller than those in ""The Hunger Games"". The action scenes are a lot less urgent. Even the story is rather frustrating in here, feels rather random and is even a little bit hard to follow at some points. The movie's villain has not much charisma either.The film wants to introduce the female main character Tris as somebody special. She passes a mental test that should indicate one of the five factions she would best fit with. People in dystopian Chicago are either brave, intelligent, peaceful, selfless or truthful in an isolated and precisely structured society after a great war that is not further explained. Tris doesn't fit to any of these factions in particular and is divergent. This is already rather strange. The so-called test lasted for maybe one minute and the main character acted in a completely normal way where I would have taken the same decisions if this test was for real. One doesn't really believe the movie that Tris is so different and special. She is an ordinary looking girl with ordinary skills who is about to go through an ordinary bad meets evil plot and to fall in love with an ordinary good-looking young man. The base of this story is already rather odd.The entire story is not much better. The so-called divergents are considered being a danger for the elite and are chased down by governmental forces. Tris joins the brave faction and tries to hide her secret. One day, the intelligent faction tries to overthrow the leading selfless faction with the the help of the mentally manipulated brave faction. Tris and her boyfriend who turns out to be the son of the leader of the selfless faction (what a surprise) will obviously save the world in a few minutes.Between the initial test and the final battle scenes, this movie is filled with endless mental and physical games and simulations that portray the main characters everyday life among the brave faction. The fighting scenes vary between being visually stunning and being ordinary. The supporting characters in the brave faction are superficial and don't add anything to the plot line. The failed assassination attempt of the main character feels completely random and out-of-place. Basically, the first and maybe the last thirty minutes of this movie are addicting while the rest tries to kick off some character development and dystopian world exploration that is mostly uninteresting because both characters and the dystopian world are rather ordinary. This all sounds rather negative and it is. So you might ask why I still gave this movie half of the points. The reasons are simple. I'm a big fan of dystopian books and movies and even the worst examples still attract my attention. The special effects are well done and worth to be seen in the cinema. The capture-the-flag game at some point in the movie is my personal highlight set in an interesting atmosphere and location. As I said, the first thirty minutes of the movie are rather entertaining and promising. The final thirty minutes are filled with action and tension. Even though the outcome of the story is highly predictable, the last thirty minutes will get you on the edge of your seats. There are even a few emotional moments in there when some characters need to do some important sacrifices. Not everything is bad in here. Half of the movie is well done, the other half really ordinary.In the end, it's up to you to decide whether you would like to watch the rip-off (""The Hunger Games"") of a rip-off (""Battle Royale""). If you liked the rip-off, you might also appreciate most parts of ""Divergent"". If you thought the rip-off was of an average quality or below, let me tell you that this movie here is clearly below the rip-off's quality. Don't waste your time on it then. As a fan of the genre, I had a little bit more than two and a half mostly entertaining hours. The movie was made to watch it in the cinemas because of its solid sound and visual effects. On the other side, I would certainly not watch it again and I wouldn't buy or rent this film either. If there was a sequel in a few years, I would probably feel like watching it for the sake of having already watched the first part but I would feel hesitating. Don't get yourself into the same situation. I would rather suggest you to avoid this movie and watch something more original which basically means that you should look for the original dystopian movies.","

"Divergent","Expat-in-America","28 April 2021","I can see how it tries to fit into the YA 'dystopia' genre but this series has nothing original and is full of silly plot holes. It tries to rework tropes we have seen done so much better in other films with higher stakes, and with better more well rounded created worlds.People can only have one personality trait? You can't be smart, brave, and kind? That makes zero sense, considering the story doesn't clarify if they have somehow modified human behaviour and emotions etc to make people so unimaginably one dimensional. The idea that 'people who have complex emotions are a threat' is so simplistic that it's kind of insulting to viewers.I watched because Theo James is a fantastic actor, but the lead actress in this is just so terrible, even he can't save it.","

"Divergent","hannahray123","15 February 2015","I am not very into the trilogy that this movie is based on, but I really liked the first book. I was quite excited to see it as a movie, entering the theater with high hopes. The clothing design was sexist. Seriously, it's the future, and women are still accustomed to body-revealing ""serious"" clothes; ranging from sexy skin-tight Erudite mini-skirts to Tris's sexy black tank top. The book was nothing like this; women wore pants.Excuse me for being a feminist, but that was a small part of the movie that had bugged me. The acting was bland, the character designs were bland, and the whole movie was rushed. Each scene just... breezed by, like the whole movie was saying ""okay, okay, yeah, yeah, you saw this scene already, let's just get this story over and done with because, apparently, the writers just don't care about our personal entertainment.""the length had made it seem like a kid's movie, along with the fact that even the romance scenes with Tris and Four were small and sped up, and the violence scenes! There was hardly any violence. For example at the scene where Tris was almost pushed over the chasm, there was literally a few pushing and shoving and then DONE. And where are the guns? The book had included real guns with bullets, but in the movie everyone was using these weird, ""futuristic"" guns that shot spike- like bullets and didn't even show blood... no one told me this was a freaking PG movie.What a waste of money. The book had unforgettable characters, great dialogue, and creative, heart-shattering scenes. This movie felt more like a joke; I wouldn't be surprised to find out, one day, that this had actually been made as a parody of sci-fi/action/romance movies. It would have done better as a parody than as a movie.","

"Divergent","pijavica","30 October 2014","... this movie is winner in that department.The connection between war, Chicago and factions is completely missing. We are told that forming of factions was the only solution for peace... If the conflict was in the city between city residents, what is the point of the wall around? If it was some outside threat, what is the point in inner city social structure? Wouldn't defense be stronger if defenders were everybody that can, instead just brave/reckless volunteers in black-shirt faction?Nobody cared to explain how can this system even begin to help bring peace. Nobody cared to explain how people became robots capable of only one trait. We have those guys with guns, and we don't know how they work? Are they independent? Are they enforcing some laws? Who make the laws? Why do they leave hobos to stay in city, what do they have to lose if they rebel? Isn't that threat to peace? Doesn't the smart ones see that? But the smart ones would realize that faction system is stupid... Wait, of course, the smart are only capable of being smart, they are incapable of saying the truth... Other ones are the ones which tell the truth. But they are too stupid to know anything... Uhhh, what a conundrum!What happens to police/military faction members when they grow too old to run everywhere while screaming like little girls, and to jump on rooftops out of moving trains? We know they can't change their mind and become smart, or go farming, so do they conveniently die, or just go to hobo nation? I smell another threat to peace, disgruntled veterans left with nothing...And the ending... After exposing major conspiracy, and after stupid system should collapse like house of cards, we have our heroes running away just so there could be couple of pointless sequels. I just hate it.Only reason I gave it 3 stars are two lead actors, I think they did a good job considering the ""masterpiece"" they had to relay to us.","

"Divergent","oscarxp25","30 March 2014","Since the release of the juggernaut ""Twilight"" back in 2008, Hollywood has been searching for any film, based on a young adult novel, that would spark the same craze those movies did. While some are successes, such as ""The Hunger Games"", there are countless others that just fall to the waste side. Does the new film ""Divergent"" rise to occasion or just fall into the same league as the other failures? The plots of ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" are very similar but different in their own ways. Both take place in a futuristic society that has become a wasteland. The people in these societies have been split into different factions that serve their own purpose to the high power of the government. These governments try to play it off as if they are one of the people but, of course, stand for everything these societies are built on, which is freedom.In ""Divergent"", which takes place in a post-war Chicago, people are split into five factions: the selfless Abgenations, the peaceful Amitys, the honest Candors, the brave Dauntless, and the intelligent Edrudites. When children are sixteen they are given a test to see where they would fit in. After the results are given, they are must choose to go with what their results were or choose their own path. Our young heroine, Beatrice or Tris as she later refers to herself as, is urged by her family and faction in Abnegation to stay, but becomes part of the Dauntless. She wants to be part of the group who protects the city and lives a more wild lifestyle than the other four.The first half of the film is a bit slow paced. It is a very stereotypical journey of a fragile young woman slowly being transforming into a strong woman. As Tris, the film's star Shailene Woodley does just fine. Tris isn't as powerful of a character as Katniss from ""The Hunger Games"" but also isn't a complete bore like Bella Swan. She falls nicely in the middle. Though Woodley, at times, does play it bland at times she does own the role and makes you care about this young girl and her journey.Director Neil Burger does the future well. It is a very sterile future that seems too clean and pure for its own good. As far as the look of everything it echoes science fiction films like ""Logan's Run"". Burger does have some pacing issues with a run time that went a bit too long. It is close to 150 minutes. Some of it, especially the beginning, could have been trimmed a bit. The only other fault I would give the director would be the waste of the role that Winslet has. What is with Hollywood casting great actresses to fill roles that aren't good enough for their talents? It happened in ""Elysium"" with Jodie Foster and it does in this film with Winslet. It isn't a terrible performance but one that just requires them to go through the motions of being a typical female baddie, right down to the wardrobe.Those things that don't work are overshadowed by what does work. The film is quite smart in the way it handles what it has to say. The title of the film comes from those select people in society who have all the qualities of the five factions. They have the ability to have empathy and see situations as whole instead of just through their own factions beliefs. Of course, the higher ups, who are the Edrudities, don't want this because this would inspire hope in people through ideas. They are creating soldiers through brain washing their citizens into doing their dirty work. It is a an interesting way to communicate to younger people, who read these novels, the power of influence and the even greater power of fear of non-acceptance. Even though she can kick ass, which she does to her costar Milles Teller, who plays a sleaze bag here, who also starred with in the the terrific ""The Spectacular Now"", Tris' true power is her ability to influence others and show that they don't have to succumb to others beliefs. Woodley does have the pureness to sell this ideal. One of her initiation processes is facing her fears head on in a dream like sequence. Burger captures the insanity that goes through a young teenage girl's mind perfectly. Especially one in the wasted world where Beatrice grew up in. There are other surprisingly wise decisions made in this film to communicate the down falls of a controlled society which you should see for yourself.While ""The Hunger Games"" shows its points through a grand and epic scale, ""Divergent"" is more cerebral in the way it lays out its evidence. ""Divergent"" maybe the answer to people who like a less flashy way of telling them the downfalls of the ""perfect society","

"Divergent","Winchester_United","25 March 2014","I understand not keeping things 100% the same in book to film adaptations, especially if they're not integral parts to the plot or if they don't translate well to screen, but many of the things that were suspenseful in the book were completely removed or trimmed away to help get that pg 13 rating and while sometimes less can be more, it certainly wasn't in this case as much of the gravitas and suspense being removed and trimmed away as well, there was not even any lack of urgency until the film was partly in it's second half.I also feel like somethings should have been explained better for those who hadn't read the books. For instance in the film and even the trailer we see the character Tori tell Beatrice that ""you're divergent, the test didn't work on you"" but in no point of the film do they really explain why the initial test didn't pan out, I mean we see how Beatrice manipulates the tests later on even in the trailer (""this isn't real""/breaks the glass) but we never get the reasoning why she tested for multiple factions thus being divergent","

"Divergent","chrispybacon123","5 June 2014","(My spoiler isn't until the very end) I don't just dislike this movie because I read the book- I really wanted to like it and was looking forward to seeing it. But yes the book was incredibly good and the movie did not do it justice at all. Even if I hadn't read the book, my opinion wouldn't change. There was no character development- leaving the audience detached from the characters. They also didn't develop any of the characters relationships - not Tris' with her fiends Christina, Will, and Al, and especially not with Four. There should have been good, emotional moments in the movie but there just weren't. Normally I can get pretty emotional when it comes to movies but I am sure that if Tris and Four had just died at any point, I would not have been upset because there was no attachment thanks to the TOTAL LACK of character development. I understand that they can't fit everything that happened it the book the way it happened because movies have time limits, but I think they very poorly chose what moments to include. All the parts I was looking forward to were either not included or were completely devoid of emotion and intensity. SPOILER: The moment when Tris has to shoot her best fiend Peter should be sad because he's her best friend- but it's not because their relationship never developed so the audience can hardly know how good of friends they were. If I hadn't read the book I'm not sure I would've even recognized who he was- even if I did it wouldn't have been an emotional moment because the audience didn't really get a chance to know his character, or any of the others for that matter.","

"Divergent","ssra_25","30 July 2014","Personally, I enjoyed every minute of Divergent, although I went to see it thinking it's just another boring and predictable story with some hero guy and/or girl who kills everything around. Turned out it wasn't like that. Many around me compared it to the Hunger Games and I suppose that in some ways it resembles it, but personally I think Divergent is so much better. I honestly don't care that much about small movie mistakes, such as the wound at her ear or stuff like that. It's not those details that give the quality of a movie. The acting does and I was very pleased with the acting. It suited the subject and the atmosphere the movie tried to create. So I'm looking forward for the sequels. My only hope is that the sequels won't be boring or exaggerated, like man sequels are. This is why sequels usually suck compared to the first movie. All-in-all, this movie has a 10 from me because it exceeded my expectations.","

What ticked me off about this movie is that it was pretty different from the book, (enough to make me annoyed) and that the entire relatively new cast (besides Winslet) cannot act. Theo James is sexy and he knows it in the movie, and Shailene Woodley is just ugh I can't explain it but she cannot act! Why are they comparing her to the fabulously talented Jennifer Lawrence when she can't even hold a candle in the acting world? This movie messed up the story for me, did Veronica Roth even see the script?","

Bland expressionless characters portrayed by actors who clearly had about as little training as the so called 'dauntless' in the movie.

If you have any self-respect don't repeat my mistake. On the bright side it won't be very difficult to forget this one. The story line was like one written by an overenthusiastic 13 year old with aspirations to be a writer and a sycophantic audience pushing him/her along with mindless enthusiasm. However, it probably could serve as some entertainment to the under 12s, and that may well be the target audience so can't fault it in this sense.","

"Divergent","TheMarwood","23 July 2014","This boneheaded blunt force allegorical tale about a teen with the ability to think with free will, which is dangerous in this dystopian society, is too derivative to swallow. Divergent is tailor made for the least discerning teen viewer, who likes their characters a bit less than one dimensional and their romances telegraphed with all the artistry of a daytime soap. The attempt to class up these proceedings with what amounts to an extended cameo by Kate Winslet backfires with her villainous role, that even she can't transcend with this cornball material. Shailene Woodley barely registers as a presence, has no charisma and can't carry this film. She brings nothing to her role and you have to demolish suspension of disbelief to accept her as a young woman who can handle herself in action. The effects are adequate, with the exception of a zip line sequence through some run down skyscrapers, that serves no narrative purpose but to show off some effects they didn't have the money to do correctly. Running at about two hours and twenty minutes, Divergent begins with our main character having to make the most important decision of her life by choosing her faction - but there's no suspense or compelling material watching an undeveloped character go through this. The narrative then becomes an endless series of training sequences, before rushing into a last act that feels like an entire sequel condensed into a climax. With so little substance, it's going to be an insurmountable task to make this a running series of films that won't be instantly crushed under the weight of its own flimsy premise.","

"Divergent","leather-turtle","16 April 2014","I was willing to take a risk on watching this movie late at night because it sounded like something bold and daring and I trusted Kate Winslet's name on the credits.Kate Winslet's character is actually in charge of the conformist government and her acting skills seemed entirely negated in this role, like she plays a zombie for the entire film, and there's nothing interesting about the character she plays.I've never seen Twilight or any movie in the series, but this movie got me in the mood to give them a shot. I think they'd be an improvement.What starts off as a bright and hopeful movie with the central character, Beatrice Prior (Tris in the cast listing), giving an attractive assessment of the factions, especially Dauntless, turns into something dark and... stupid. She enters Dauntless and finds that it's run by jerks. We get the predictable scenes and scenarios of her almost getting kicked out of Dauntless to become factionless but she barely makes it in. She befriends one of the jerks who helps her and with whom she's destined to fall in love, just as in every other mainstream, teenage romance.One of the parts that made me groan was when Beatrice Prior climbed the ferris wheel to get a better view of their opponents and her romantic interest and co-leader of the group, ""Four"", didn't want to follow her any higher BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID OF HEIGHTS. He even said, ""We all have our weakness."" This, to me, was an overt attempt to appeal to every cowardly teenager who is also afraid of heights and a clear declaration of how spineless ""Divergent"" as a movie really is. There was a lot of this kind of follow-through.Beatrice Prior, in being ""Divergent"", is actually a pretty normal teenage girl/woman who doesn't so much fit into a category as wants to fulfill her potential. Everyone else pretty much chooses conformity. It's as if being ""Divergent"" reaches a ceiling of conformity in this movie and everyone's lives become predictable.I sincerely DO NOT recommend this movie unless you're in the mood to shove plastic brain pulp into your head. It sucked. I'm giving it 6 stars because it has Hollywood production quality, and I like to reserve much lower ratings for movies that don't even try to live up to mainstream expectations.Besides: This movie doesn't suck in any exceptional way other than calling itself ""Divergent"" when it's one of the most conformist, mainstream, and mediocre movies I've ever seen. It deserves a mediocre rating....It makes me a bit sad that this movie is classified as Sci-Fi... and Action to a lesser degree. At least when Twilight is called Fantasy, one may readily add ""delusional teenage"", which seems possibly more appropriate here when the same kind of movie is titled ""Divergent"". I don't think many Sci-Fi or Action movie fans will enjoy this movie. It looks like quality, but it's really schlock.The least disappointing parts of this movie involved the excellent acting of Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn, who play Beatrice Prior's parents. They play the roles so well, convincingly, and genuinely, that I could forget for that time that the rest of the movie lacked any depth, meaning, or sincerity. For their screen time, I didn't feel I had to hold a great big load of crap at the back of my mouth to entertain the premise of the movie while all meaning of that premise was repeatedly violated by flat, spineless characters. Judd and Goldwyn deserve significant praise for pulling that off, and fortunately their characters were both killed during the movie so they probably won't have to endure any sequels to come :-)This is another movie suitable for the decadent, self-deceived, spoiled teenagers who have yet to actually deal with reality on their own and discover the real consequences of being ""Divergent"", but good and bad.","

"Divergent","zaraleejensen","13 April 2014","Good screenplay and all - but the actors where stiff, and the trailer gave off the idea of some amazing action / sci-fi movie - which turned out to be some teenage love story / empowerment to teenage girls. I went in expecting to be kept on the edge of my seat with all the exciting things, but when the people started jumping off trains, i seriously wanted to start cracking up laughing. I lasted about 20 minutes into this, then couldn't handle it anymore. I've heard people compare it to hunger games - WRONG. I love hunger games, this was just terrible! If i had of honestly known what this movie was going to be like - i wouldn't have even bothered to download it.","

"Divergent","kristofen","14 September 2014","What did you expect? The Godfather? Granted I don't think its perfect but reading all these 1/10 negative reviews made me up my rating. You're a bunch of Erudites! Seriously, though, you can't watch Frozen and expect it to have Quentin Tarantino quality. Its like humor, not everyone has the same taste. Satire might not be your crucifix, that doesn't make a joke ""low quality"". The plot is pretty solid if you ask me, a post-apocalyptic society where the survivors developed a communistic system to avoid future chaos considering human nature drove the past civilization to destruction. Divergents have multiple aptitudes making them a threat to linear society. l admit I have above average intelligence, but even my 12 year old cousin understood the premise. The casting was splendid, Oscar nominee Shailene Woodley especially the scene where shes crying (no spoiler here) and Theo James' character develops well and opens up progressively and we were all genuinely terrified of Jai ""Eric""'s ruthlessness. Also Kate Winslet played a fine bitchy dame. The dialogue was believable and appropriate for the story (they were teens and this isn't a witty comedy). Overall, the story was thought-provoking. To those missing the bigger picture, there's actually a connection between this universe and ours. Our society also categorizes people either by race, religion, politics, culture, education, sexuality, school cliques (in a small range), etc. There's always expectations in each group, a social code that must be followed. I actually enjoy the way Divergent depicts authority in such a menacing way, showing how ridiculous these bigots can be. Why are there laws against gay marriage or against innocent children who were forced into the US and can't get an education/driver's license/job when they're adults? Ignorance, that's why. I hope this movie inspired its targeted young audience to rebel and fight for what is right in their judgment.","

"Divergent","steadrick1","24 July 2014","Let's put aside the preposterous dystopian future that only a child of privilege could envisage i.e. one that has not even a fleeting knowledge of the human condition because she's never suffered.So you have the requisite shallows to suspend disbelief and you settle down to watch essentially a C movie rip off of the Hunger Games. Don't get me wrong I'm not a massive fan of the hunger games films but at least there was some originality, great casting and performances.So our heroine (aka Katniss lite) finds she is a divergent ie she can do more that one thing - and the overwhelming feeling is one of 'so what'. These two words echoed inside my head for the entire remainder of the film.And that's it folks. Our heroine's struggle is one big 'so what'. Her training 'so what'. Her escape 'so what', the revelations 'so what', the tattoos 'so what', the fight back 'so what' etc etc. All the way to the end when it just becomes one big 'so what'. So what was the point. As an auteurs vision it is non existent. You could hot swap a whole host of middle of the road jobbing Hollywood directors and the end result would be this. This is not an auteurs film. Watch a Michael Mann, Scorsese or Christopher Nolan film and you know you are watching a singular directors vision. Whilst even their films may have their flaws they are compelling narratives delivered with visual and artistic flair.So if it's not that then what is it.It is a commercial venture designed to separate the viewing public from their money. It's a cynical exploitation of the hunger games films. That fact that is not very good and is an insult to the intelligence of anyone with even moderate intelligence is irrelevant ultimately. It's a money grabbing turd. Exactly the kind of film Hollywood wants. So next time when you go to the theatre and you notice an odd smell when you hand over your twelve bucks you're probably in the queue for Divergent 2.I'd tell you to avoid it but it's probably too late.",NA
"Divergent","magnuslhad","12 September 2014","I'm a fan of near-future films set in dystopian worlds, but this 'Hunger Games' rip-off never tries to reach beyond its obvious 16-24-year old demographic. Young adults are assigned to clan-like groups based on their personality type. Those who do not fit any profile, Divergents, are seen as a threat. This flimsy premise is the basis for an incoherent narrative that neither entertains not provokes thought. The sole purpose seems to be to show the young, fit cast running, jumping, climbing, punching, kicking ass and wielding big guns. Kate Winslet mugs it up and it would not be a surprise if she winked directly at camera. I wasn't expecting it to be 'Gattaca', but the fact that it is this flat and predictable is disappointing.",NA
"Divergent","chibitapy","21 December 2015","The concept of this movie is very unique although it still shows us how ""love"" is more important than any others. And I also like that it takes a whole movie to know such a simple thing. It's so interesting if human is divided into 4 kinds in the real world, but I'm afraid it can happen by people being more religious and getting authority in groups. I didn't know that this movie is so popular when I watched this, but I feel like it's going to be very popular in Japan as well if people get to have a chance to know about this movie. the review of this movies is not really good but I still recommend you to watch this movie because it's worth it.",NA

The books were engaging enough to pull me one into the next. This movie didn't engage me in the same manner. It didn't bother me to stop it and continue the next day. Something was missing. I didn't become emotionally invested in the screen characters. The movie skipped through critical book plot events and lingered on romantic interludes. I don't know.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Liam3011","25 October 2023","Just fresh out of the cinema after seeing Five Nights at Freddy's, so here's my spoiler free review for it.Now, personally, I don't find the actual concept of FNAF all that scary so I personally wasn't ""scared"" watching this. The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering ""Can I take my kid to see this?"". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The ""twist"" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think ""Is this a horror film?"". It's not ""balls-to-the-wall"" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Chri-seened-it","27 October 2023","If you loved the FNAF games, go see this, at the base level it's fun to see this stuff come to life, especially when the costume design and set design are this good.If you're a harsh critic, you might HATE this film.Its biggest problems are character development overall storyline, and horror factor. (This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","tankboy-46851","27 October 2023","So, I know it must be extremely difficult to take a simple gaming concept like Five Nights at Freddy's and stretch that idea out into a full blown movie. I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline ""cheese"", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Platypuschow","3 January 2024","PlotA troubled security guard begins working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really ""Got"" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part
Matthew Lilliard is decent here
Hutcherson always looks like he's bored
Weak kills
Pants plot
Too much melodrama.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Sleepin_Dragon","12 November 2023","A security guard gets a job, and suddenly realises he's going to have an incredibly challenging and difficult night.I genuinely and desperately wanted to love this film, the trailers looked so cool, and despite not being a gamer, I knew of the game.Now, if I were judging this solely on the visuals, I'd be giving it a mammoth score, and healing praise onto it, it does look fantastic, and as for the 'locals,' they look so cool, the special effects are great, genuinely a smashing looking film, one that my fifteen year old self would have loved.Now, the important bit, the translation from game to film, I really wish I could say it worked brilliantly, I'm not sure, I think there's something missing, does the story work? Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","djrmc24","30 October 2023","Five Night at Freddy's was a pretty big letdown. I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","PrinceCharmingHere","27 October 2023","People are overanalyzing this movie as though it's supposed to be a masterclass in acting and screenwriting. It's a ""horror"" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","AfricanBro","31 October 2023","I found the concept to be a bit cartoonish, so I was expecting it to be more fun. The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole ""kidnapped little brother"" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","chenp-54708","26 October 2023","The Five Nights at Freddy's franchise is interesting and while I haven't' followed up with the most recent lore and games, when I was in middle and high school, I really enjoyed playing the game especially the first three as I thought they were fun and had some fun scares. I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","katharine-nichols","31 October 2023","Just saw Five Nights at Freddy's. That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","justdialready","27 October 2023","I will try to keep this short and concise but overall I think the movie holds up to most expectations. Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jacobtarter","27 October 2023","More of a 6.5/10 imo , kind of a casual fan of the franchise but It's an enjoyable movie. Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he ""still had control of them "" at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","pedroquintaoo","8 November 2023","""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is a film that seems to stay faithful to the games, especially in its portrayal of the creepy animatronic characters that capture the eerie spirit of the game's characters. Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","OliS_19","25 October 2023","The Fnaf movie was a rollercoaster of mixed feelings. Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","meddlecore","28 October 2023","There have now been three films in this oeuvre, all of which are remarkably similar: The Banana Splits Movie; Willy's Wonderland; and Five Nights At Freddy's.The latter two of which have incredibly similar plots.Of course, I know this particular film is supposed to be based off a popular video game (of the same name)...and not just a blatant ripoff of the previous films.Although, I've never played it myself...so don't know how true to it it is.One thing is for sure, however...this is by far the worst of the three.Mainly, because the storyline, here, is so poorly developed.Meaning that The Banana Splits Movie still reigns supreme, at the top of the list.Although, this does seem to pay- at least a little bit of- homage to both of the previous films.In regards to the former, how the little girl makes friends with the robots.And in regards to the latter, with the scene where they have the main character cleaning up the mess left by the goons (in true Nicholas Cage fashion).The main issue I have with this film, is that there is too much focus on the backstory- where I found myself wanting it to be more of a pure horror.With the whole angle about the robots ""being haunted by the ghosts of dead children"" seemingly thrown in out of nowhere...which just didn't jive for me.On top of that, the little girl is portrayed to be much too childish for her age.So much so, that it's almost cartoonish.While, the overall structure of the storyline just doesn't seem to gel.Every time I thought the horror was about to kick in...it just ended up being drawn out even further, to make room for additional aspects of the backstory.Which seemed to be largely unnecessary.As, it, plain and simply, could have- and would have- been better, if they focused on making it less of a drama, and more of a horror.Because, in reality...there is almost no horror in this at all!And when it does, eventually, kick in...it's incredibly anti-climactic.Which leaves you feeling like, ""I sat through all that...for this?!"".At the very least...it comes off as a massive missed oppourtunity.Because I really thought this was going to be cool.But, frankly...it's quite lame.So I can't help but be disappointed by the whole thing.Because this was a completely unrewarding experience.2 out of 10.","

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","alex_ashman","25 October 2023","I'll tell it straight to the point since this is the first review of this movie on IMDB. I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","iamMarkPrice","22 December 2023","If you were a tween in the 2010s, you are no doubt excited to see this beloved horror franchise leap from your PC to the big screen as the latest nostalgia film eager to cynically part you from your money. Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","olivia-washington","25 October 2023","I'll preface this review by saying I have not played any of the games and barely know the plot. I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more ""80's slasher"" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","minecracker","27 October 2023","My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, ""That's just a theory..."". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final ""fight"" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","daryllholland","1 November 2023","Fans of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game series were eagerly awaiting the release of the film adaptation, but unfortunately, the results were less than stellar. The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","kuner-59029","1 November 2023","Another week, another Blumhouse horror film.Based on a video game series (which I have no played), Five Nights at Freddy's is another 80s nostlgia horror flick. The plot revolves around a closed chucky cheese like restaurant from the 80s where the animatronics come to life and murder people.It's a great premise, and the film certainly sets up some interesting ideas, and wisely gives the main characer some agency. He's a down on his luck guy who after losing his family cares for his kid sister, but suffers the same mysterious dream every night. Personally, I would have found it more plausible and interesting if the dreams had begun when he started working at Freddy's which would make more sense in light of the nature of the dream and his interactions therein.Unfortunately, once the female cop shows up, the film begins to come apart. She does not act like a cop at all, being entirely understanding and way too friendly, going for a walk and sitting down with him at the river at their second meeting. Yes, this is (poorly) expained later on, but the writing of their scenes is awful.The best scenes in the film belong to the lawyer of the protagonist's aunt. He's hilarious. They set her up as a great antagonist, only to drop that entire plotline.The animatronics are well designed and sufficiently creepy, but the film shies away from violence and never really commits to being a horror film. It seems to be more geared towards kids, especially with the ""fun"" scenes of partying and playing with the robots, but I'm not sure it really works. Much of the acting is pretty bad (especially the cop), with the protagonist never cracking a joke and wearing the exact same facial expression the entire movie. The second half suffers some real pacing issues, but the worst part is the ham fisted exposition dump that explains the robots. The moment the mystery is solved, you can feel the film deflating as the suspense is all but gone. You instantly know how it's going to end.Matthew Lillard of Scream fame is there again and does what you expect him to do. It drags on too long, and outstays its welcome, especially once we realize the horror we were promised isn't happening.A pity. WIth tighter editing and a bit more energy to the main characer, this could have been great.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","movieman6-413-929510","29 October 2023","Five Nights at Freddy's is a new horror film arrangement and written in part by Emma Tammi, director of The Wind. The films are based on the horror game of the same name.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) works as a night security guard at the local pizzeria Freddy Fazbear. He has to work here for five nights, but during these nights he discovers that something is wrong with the pizzeria's animatronic costumes. So he begins to learn about a dark secret.This game adaptation works better for people who are familiar with the horror game, because it contains nice references and other easter eggs that link back to the game. People who don't know the game will not really understand these things.For a game known for its jump scares, designed to frighten and further frighten players, the film strangely has almost none of these horror moments. This film sometimes seems more meaningful to younger viewers of just sixteen. For older viewers, the film is not scary and if they know nothing about the game, the film may be more unclear, or overcome separately.The location of the famous pizzeria from the game seems positive, especially for people who are familiar with it. Since most movie studios didn't use CGI for this movie, the animatronic costumes of the Fazbear crew have to be brought into the movie. Jim Henson's Orphan Shop was responsible for the Fazbear crew. They are performed by puppeteers and stunt artists. This will get her across.However, the story of the film can be a problem for viewers of the film. In addition to the story around the pizzeria, it also tells the story of the main character. In addition to a dark past, he also has a struggle to retain the rights to raise his youngest sister. These storylines do not always correspond well with each other, which means that the film can sometimes be a bit unclear and difficult to overcome.This inferior script sometimes makes it difficult for the actors to come across well. Josh Hutcherson sometimes remains a bit vague. He does come across well as an older brother who tries to take good care of his sister. His sister is played by Piper Rubio, who delivers some decent acting for a novice actress. The brother and sister actors have a well-known bond together. Matthew Lillard also plays a small role in the film, which he portrays appropriately. After his previous acting work in Scream and Scooby-Doo, it is also nice to see him again in this horror film.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","mindlessmoviemaster","29 October 2023","With Willys Wonderland. I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.","

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Tactrix","30 October 2023","I was looking forward to this movie, because I was hoping they would have the good sense to make it a proper horror movie. Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a ""who done it?"" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Prismark10","29 October 2023","Five Nights at Freddy's is an adaptation of a popular video game. It already served as an inspiration for the much better The Banana Splits Movie in 2019.What should be a gory comedy horror movie. Five Nights at Freddy's is a more serious movie about grief and loss masquerading as a horror film.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a security guard with many issues. He cannot get over the fact that his brother was abducted when he was a kid and was never found. Mike is unable to hold a steady job, hooked on pills and has anger issues.Mike cares for his withdrawn younger sister Abby and faces a custody battle over her with his aunt Jane.His career advisor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) gets him a job as a night guard at an abandoned family diner known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Mike reluctantly accepts as he needs the job to keep custody of his sister.Only when he dozes off at work, it sort of amplifies the events leading up to his brother's abduction in his dreams. He also meets Vanessa Shelly, a cop who seems to know more about the history of the park.Then there are the creepy animatronic mascots. They come alive and kill some delinquents sent by aunt Jane to damage the diner, so Mike would get fired. The mascots later take an interest with Abby as they seem to bond with her when Mike brought her to work one day.This is such an uneven film, I though it was two different kind of movies that got meshed together. The horror parts only comes alive much later. Even then it is tame in order to be a family friendly scary movie.The similar themed Willy's Wonderland was more fun with a silent Nicolas Cage causing mayhem.","

I scare very easily and absolutely none of this was the slightest bit frightening.Weak scoring, mediocre acting, SOO many plot holes, and low-tension conflict.This has less tension than a rom-com to be completely honest. I would not be surprised to learn that the script was written by a bot. Every plot point was predictable and each piece of dialogue felt like it was copy and pasted from every other movie I've seen.This was pretty much just a well-funded fan fiction. I expected much more of an adaptation of a very fun and frightening video game.It might be fun for kids, but it's not exactly appropriate because there is violence, so I'm not sure what audience they were going for... it certainly wasn't me.","

If you haven't played the games, I can understand why you may dislike or be confused about what was going on in the film. BUT! If your a long-time fan of the games (myself included) you'll love it. The cast is amazing. Josh Hutcherson as mike was a great casting choice and in my opinion, he basically is mike in real life.There's plenty of easter eggs for fans and got me looking everywhere for secrets!! While the movie isn't exactly like the games, it's faithful enough that you can recognise it as a fnaf film and not some generic horror.Long story short, if your not a fan of fnaf, this movie probably isn't going to be good to you. It can be confusing and odd and that's honestly understandable.

First off it took 40 minutes before anything happened and the story was so forced and hard to care about. I didn't play the games because they never interested me so idk if this is supposed to be a part of the story but wow was it a terrible story. The plot was so poorly thought out and cringy with almost no horror aspects at all. I thought it was supposed to be a horror movie, which from what I understand is what the video games were, but it ended up being a mystery movie kind of. The acting is horrible and the screen writing didn't help them. The interactions between the characters are so unrealistic and their emotions are so random and extreme. One character is so unnecessarily secretive it's frustrating. I'm really sorry if you're a fan of this franchise and I know you probably really want to like this movie but be realistic about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The only reason I didn't rate this 1 or 2 stars is because the animatronics look really good, for the VERY limited time you see them.","

Firstly I assumed it be broken into five nights with a simple new security guard who has more intense violent encounters each night. But it just seemed like they were trying to hard for such a great idea. No idea why it was a 15 rated movie. Seriously though it had potential and looked like an episode of Doctor Who which can be scary but I expected more. Horror movies have really gone soft since 2000 and this is no exception. I really enjoyed the directing, the characters design and the acting I was just let down by the writing and probably the studios desire to not make it 18 rated.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jtindahouse","27 October 2023","This film had been getting excitement buzz for a large portion of the year and I could never work out why. It looked like it was going to be terrible. I'm guessing fans of the game were creating the excitement. I went in with an open mind though hoping to be pleasantly surprised. I was not sadly. This was the worst film I have seen in 2023.First of all, the film is incredibly boring. There is almost no horror in it. There's one scene near the midway point that would be considered horror I suppose, but it was probably the most boring scene in the entire movie. I understand the film is PG-13 but come on, give us something to work with.Then you have the unbearable characters. As if the adults weren't bad enough, the film adds an unlikable child to the centre of the story. Who thought that was going to be a good idea?Then there's the animatronic ""villains"" of the movie. I have never seen less scary creatures in a movie before. You could put these in a Disney Pixar movie and toddlers wouldn't be afraid of them.The film is long for a horror movie, coming in at around 110 minutes, and it feels every bit of it. The pacing is non-existent. Long scene after long scene with nothing being added to the story. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked my watch.People who choose this film as their 2023 Halloween film are going to be annoyed and let down. It's safe, bland and could barely be called horror. A generous 3/10.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","happyjam","1 November 2023","I was ready to really love this movie having played and been terrorized by the game on occulus, but what a massive let down. It starts out with some horror promise, but this quickly deflates once the main characters and story come into play. My main question was- was this written during the writers strike by stand ins because omg. What. A. Mess. The dialog and acting borders the ridiculous and then pole vaults waaaaay over it once ""Vanessa"" arrives on the scene. What is wrong with this character? Her lines, moods, and acting is ALL over the map! Calm and demure one second, then with her very next sentence is ready to murder. ROFL! People in our theater were laughing after every one of her completely over-the-top lines and not in a good way either. She was an absurd character with almost zero purpose other than to provide poorly written plot exposition and unintentional comedy. ""If you bring Abby back here, I will SHOOT you."" Comic gold offered up with complete seriousness- this line had our theater in stitches. One of M. Night Shyamalan's over the top disastrous characters would be hard pressed to keep up w/ ol' Vanessa's ""acting"" lol!The rest is a forgettable mess of wretched acting, boring family drama, boring pacing, a needlessly convoluted ""plot"", and lukewarm ""horror"". Honestly this felt like a throwaway movie of the week by a first time director. Nothing to offer. Josh Hutcherson's done much better and it was sad to see him in such a turd of a film. Maybe it will reach cult popularity due to its awfulness and stupidity a-La Rocky Horror, but even that'd be a stretch. Avoid it unless it's streaming and you need to numb your brain.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Rayofsun71","29 October 2023","This movie took elements from almost all of the games and mashed them all into one, in reality we didn't even put a name to a villain until at least 2016-17, there were no really edge of your seat moments, there was a few good easter eggs but the animatronics were done really well, I can at least give it that, I don't blame Emma Tammi for this, I blame the writers because something happened in that writers room and I'd like to know exactly what went down because while I know Scott had a say in this how on earth did he approve the final script? I'm sorry to say as a fan since the beginning I was rather disappointed and glad I didn't see it in theaters, this is more of a 'I've got a couple hours I'll watch it' type of movie, not very good and that's sad.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","BA_Harrison","26 October 2023","This movie adaptation of popular video game Five Nights at Freddy's has been a long time coming; in the meantime, we've had The Banana Splits Movie and Willy's Wonderland, both of which have illustrated that making a decent film about killer animatronics is no walk in the park.Similar to Willy's Wonderland, FNAF sees a newly recruited security guard (Josh Hutcherson) discovering that the mechanical attractions at a closed-down themed restaurant have a life of their own. And just like Willy's Wonderland, the film squanders any potential for a wild and gory white-knuckle ride, director Emma Tammi delivering a very tame experience that focuses more on security guard Mike's troubled past and his relationship with his young sister Abby (Piper Rubio) than it does on the horror of being stalked and killed by homicidal machines.Avid gamers might enjoy seeing the characters come to life on the big screen, but I imagine even the most forgiving of Freddy fans will be disappointed by the lack of atmosphere, thrills and OTT violence in this uninspired Blumhouse misfire.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","BR250105","25 October 2023","I went in with high expectations for this film and I truly believe it was so much better than I imagined. They really brought the games to life. There were twists and oh my god moments when watching, plus there were many other themes highlighted in the film not just the pizzeria which I really enjoyed, it kept the film more real, maybe more relatable.I'd like to have known more about what happened after but I'm not too fussed with that as there most likely will be a sequel that ties loose ends.Watching this brought so many memories of me playing the games when I was young, young me was jumping in my seat, it felt like young me and present me really connected.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","TheMysteriousReviewer","30 October 2023","I'm gonna be honest, video game movies have been getting better in recent years. And I thought they were gonna get progressively better than they were in early ears in video game adapted movies. But I guess not all of them can be good. Five Nights at Freddy's is just another soulless video game adaptation that only wants to make this movie cash out the games. While it may have some good visuals that stay true to the games with the animatronics and the details on the pizzeria, the movie would provide a plot that relies on just Mike and his arc about his family issues ti the point of becoming predictable. I'll give the movie for trying, but the story around the pizzeria doesn't happen until the third act. Also, the movie is not as scary as you may think. In fact, the movie barely has any scary moments. Most we would get is just characters playing around the pizzeria and the animatronics interacting the one character, but not in a thrilling way. And not to mention with how the characters have been handled. Mike being the punching bag and Abby's interactions to the animatronics. And they're connection don't really affect much. I think the best recommendation is this will be for the die hard FNAF fans. After all, they have been asking for many years if there would be an actual FNAF movie, and here we are. You'll probably enjoy it. Outside of that, I don't think it would be worth a watch. It would be better to play the games instead. Actually, I even recommend the fan SFM videos on YouTube. At least some of them can have enjoyable storytelling. As for the actual movie, the only thing we would get is just disappointing and easily dull. I guess I'll just wait for Sonic The Hedgehog 3 next year. Happy Halloween.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","fad-38798","29 October 2023","I know nothing of the game so reviewing it as the 'horror' film it claims to be.It's no horror film. I've seen scarier adverts.While the film has great visuals, these visuals are limited to the animatronics and half a derelict pizza place.What acting there is, is good. Likewise the soundtrack.But where it all falls apart is the paper thin plot, that is told rather than shown.First third of the movie is merely an exemplar to explain the game. The rest an extremely linear story that fails to explain itself.At no point is there any horror. Not even an atmospheric build-up.While the animatronics are good that in itself does not make a good film.I'm told the idea comes from a very popular game. No doubt these fanbois will think me a heretic who 'does not get it'. But I'm a movie-goer, not a gamer and this very poor film was at the movies.Keep in mind I'm reviewing the film, not the game.","

But for first hour or so not much actually really happens, you will struggle to actually want to watch the entire movie after being so bored already.Why is it a 15 (uk) no one really knows, a little blood here little blood there is about it.This title and any other they make will go down to the pit with all the other badly done video games to movies.It seems lately anything blumhouse touch turns to sludge rather than gold..Fans of the game will think this is a great movie for the fact is they like the animatronic figures alone but are forgetting about what makes a good movie.","

However the trailer for this movie certainly looked like something I would be into! I toughed it out for slightly over an hour and had to turn it off! I was beyond bored to be really honest. It was a whole lot of repetitive, snooze fest scenes! I was expecting much more given the great cast list I am a fan of Josh, Elizabeth and Matthew. But I was very unimpressed by the movie overall. I was intrigued still with 1/2 questions which I asked someone that had watched it all for! And when they answered my questions I can truthfully say I'm glad I didn't bother to finish it! Complete waste of time.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jadehilton-44857","25 October 2023","Started off slow, but the pacing was more or less the usual for a horror film. Although it was more of a thriller than a horror in my opinion. Probably because the movie was rated a 15. It was not scary at all yet it made you feel creeped out. Vanessa being Williams daughter is a bit confusing to the games lore, as well as Mike not actually being Williams child also. It got a bit childish when all the animatronics team up with Abby to make a fort. I felt disappointed that the movie went towards that direction. I wanted a scare, but all in all the movie was not actually too bad. It was visually brilliant, with the animatronics looking spot on compared to the game, but the plot just needed quite a bit of work. The visuals were worked on more than the storyline, a big let down for someone as myself who has been waiting 10 years for the film and has been a long time fan of the franchise. I was sad to see that Markiplier is indeed NOT in the movie, but I hope to see him in the second. Although a couple of other youtubers did make appearances.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Cenobite136","31 October 2023","I'll start by saying I don't know much about this franchise. My review is from an outsiders prospective. The PG-13 rating really hurts FNAF here. I understand they were trying to appeal to a broader audience, but this film has no scare factor whatsoever. If it was a gorefest, it could at least add some horror elements to make up for everything else this movie does wrong. The kills are mostly offscreen/ ineffective. The plot is weak, and laughably bad in almost ever way. Especially when it comes to these protagonists desicions.The movie is a slog fest. The animatronics basically take a back seat in their own franchise, which is a shame because the look of the animatronics is the only good thing about this snooze fest.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","samjeffreys","26 October 2023","While the Jim Henson Company did a great job with the animatronics, they are utterly wasted and contribute no scares to the film whatsoever. The plot, so to speak, is spread throughout the runtime and is predictable at every turn.If you were expecting the movie to imitate the tone and content of the games, you'll be largely disappointed beyond a few names and easter eggs.If you were expecting decent spooks, plotting, or performances, you'll be more disappointed still.Matthew Lillard chews the scenery in each of his (too few) scenes and is far and away the standout. An anthology of shorts - perhaps tied together through Lillard's character - would have allowed for better scares and more closely resembled the source material.","

As a long-time fan with a very in-depth knowledge of the lore and the story, this movie did not disappoint, besides the fact that it had to end!! I loved it from beginning to finish, I loved the added lore and the depth of the characters, from Mike to Vanessa to even Max. The cinematography was incredible, the sets were GORGEOUS (especially the pizzaria), the score was wonderful, acting was great even with the kiddos, and man oh MAN those animatronics. Makes me shudder knowing that they're out there, somewhere . . .Also- the jumpscares, man. I went insane every time even when I could tell that they were coming. Terrifying but in an amazing way.LOVE LOVE LOVE, and any fan will too! (:","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","terrylarosa","30 October 2023","We sure didn't since we have Peacock. Simply one of the most laughable horror movies of all time. All the deaths except for one are off screen. Least that we saw since we FF it after a mind numbing hour of nothingness with only a couple of ludicrous deaths. There is no horror except of course having to watch this in a theatre. The laughable monsters are so ridiculous looking that I couldn't stop laughing. Josh is no leading man material and to see his boring countenance nearly the whole movie is unbearable. How this made so much money opening weekend is mystifying but hey I watched tons of awful movies when I was a teenager myself. There are no scares, no good effects; certainly no good deaths. I expect a precipitous drop next week in the box office. Awful awful awful.","

The fan service made the film worthwhile. Storyline felt rushed and incomplete. The big ending one of the most impactful and significant events seemed brushed over and honestly not amazing, it felt rushed aswell as over simplified. Cameos and fan service was enjoyable but that's what they're there for. If it wasn't for them it wouldn't be enjoyable as characters motives are weak and change with little influence. The entire premise was weak with how we interacted with the animatronics.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","kevin_robbins","28 October 2023","My wife and I recently watched Five Nights at Freddy's (2023) on Peacock this evening. The storyline centers around an older brother striving to provide for his younger sister, whom his aunt intends to adopt. He accepts a job at an abandoned establishment reminiscent of Chuck E. Cheese, only to discover that the animatronics within are far more alive than they initially seem.Directed by Emma Tammi (The Wind), the film features a cast that includes Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games), Matthew Lillard (Scream), Elizabeth Dean Lail (You), Piper Rubio (Unstable), and Mary Stuart Masterson (The Stepford Wives).This movie possesses a wealth of potential with a captivating concept, provocative settings, a strong cast, and intriguing subplots. It had all the elements necessary for a potential masterpiece but falls short of expectations. The kill scenes are disappointingly lackluster, starting from the opening credits, which could have set a thrilling tone but did not deliver. There's a distinct absence of gore, visual depictions of killings, blood splatter, or any such elements. The film's PG-13 rating is a clear limitation. It's a missed opportunity, as the atmosphere is well-crafted, and the cast delivers stellar 10/10 performances. Lillard is a perfect fit for his role, and Masterson makes for an excellent villain. Hutcherson's performance is compelling, portraying an authentic big brother dealing with inner turmoil. The ending reveal adds to the film's intrigue. However, the subpar kill scenes remain a glaring flaw.In conclusion, Five Nights at Freddy's had the potential for greatness had it pushed the envelope and embraced an R-rating for a more intense horror experience. Instead, it caters to a middle school audience. I would give it a 4/10 rating, but I still recommend watching it at least once.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","MovieWarfare","28 October 2023","Five Nights at Freddy's is a great concept. A person is provided a job as a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and things become weirder each night. That sounds like a great horror movie. It's a shame this isn't remotely it.The movie is an actual slog fest that is more focused on adapting the lore, rather than being a competent horror movie. The games are notable for their jump scares and this movie only had 2 which is mind-boggling. I dislike horror movies that are reliant on jump scares but this movie would have actually benefitted if it had more because it was so boring. This movie not being scary at all, is my biggest disappointment. The plot is stupid, the characters are uninteresting, and a lot of the scenes are incredibly goofy (that fort-building scene sticks in my mind).Still, the animatronics look terrific and the set design feels like it was pulled right from the games. It is also filled with easter eggs that fans will love. The sound design is also great and can be quite unsettling. I can see fans liking this movie. However, a YouTube video talking about FNAF lore is more interesting than this.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","tpkrause1","13 February 2024","Before the movie even came out, I read about what a let down it would be. The reviews here on IMDb have echoed the same chorus. But, especially since Future Man, I happen to enjoy Josh Hutcherson, so I knew I'd watch it.Unpopular Opinion: Five Nights at Freddy's is a pretty great movie.I liked the Saw-ish beginning with plushies, and I almost misjudged the movies based on the lack of gore (pulling punches in horror movies is a pet peeve). When it got into the story though, referencing the kidnappings in the 80s and the ghost children and all that, I have to admit that I really got sucked in. Oddly enough, the movie made me feel a bit deeply about what was happening.Based on that video game, this was a lot more than I was expecting. Not a bad movie at all. I enjoyed the direct references to the game and think the filmmakers did a great job developing the game's ideas into some scary stuff.","

The film is very disjointed and the half assed story was poorly conveyed and extremely Cliché. If you are thrilled by the power of friendship saving the day you will love this movie. If you love a comedic PG adaptation of one of the most horrific stories of child murder and possession you will also love this movie. But if you love to watch quality movies with tonnes of care put into them, containing an original and engaging story, maybe go watch netflix instead.This film could have easily been improved if it wasn't desperately trying to target 7 year olds, despite most pf the fanbase being adults or in their late teens by now. It should have been an origin story for the animatronics, not a romantic comedy, teen, summer fun loving movie.Biggest disappointment in a while.","

I have to surmise that the games involve sneaking around the diner while avoiding the menacing glare of the animatronics?To be fair most studios who try to adapt what makes computer games so successful onto the screen fail. I'm thinking of you Street Fighter 2, The Last of Us, Super Mario Brothers, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, *The Witcher, Resident Evil - the problem is that playing a game is incredibly immersive, as should be watching a film, and video games have much, much more license to take their time in getting you to bond with the character and story you're telling.I digress, massively. Basically, FNaF's is slow, boring, predictable. You do not spend any time with the monsters (hardly) and I get the feeling the storytellers couldn't decide if we, the audience, were supposed to sympathise with them, or fear them.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Pnkprinses309","27 October 2023","I'm one who read the books and played the gameSomeone decided they should combine the 2. Why? I have no idea. Perhaps they saw the Nick Cage movie and decided they needed to keep elements of the game in it.The book itself is really good, from the child killer to the possessions, to the main girl's backstory. But they removed it all to fit in a main character who is a security guard for 5 nights (like the game).They kept the elements of the book with the serial killer and instead of a female lead with a tragic loss of a brother, the security guard has that. It's interesting how they decided to play it.All in all it's not perfect, but it isn't bad. I think the picture drawing parts were weird...and the jump scares were cheap. I will say the ending of the book series is awful, so this is a nice compromise.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","FeastMode","27 October 2023","The entirety of my nearly sold-out crowd seemed to love this movie. There were five different moments of full applause and cheers from the crowd. You might agree if one or more of the following are true: (1) You've played the video game. (2) You enjoy very tame/light horror. (3) You've enjoyed this new trend of ""family horror"" like M3gan (4 stars).None of those are true for me. I am confident that horror fiends will find it severely underwhelming. This is the kind of movie you might show to a 10-year-old who wants to get into horror movies. Just like with M3gan, the crowd was very young and there were even children.It's severely limited by the cowardly PG-13 rating. But I've liked some PG-13 horror movies, like Insidious. This one just isn't even a tiny bit scary. It didn't make me jump. The ""scary"" scenes amount to about 8% of this movie. The rest is fairly slow and boring.To make it worse, this movie makes no sense. You have to completely turn your brain off and not question anything. Otherwise the complete lack of logic and aimlessness of the story becomes apparent.It also has some very questionable moments and little things that made it feel off. One small example, someone uses fingers so wipe the blood off a knife, a move commonly seen by Ghostface in the Scream movies. The problem is, there's zero blood on the knife.This reminds me of a recent streaming movie with a very similar premise called Willy's Wonderland starring the great Nick Cage. That one didn't hold back, but it was a much lower quality streaming movie than this theatrically released one. I ended up giving it the same score.I didn't hate this movie. It's pretty funny and whimsical. I just really wish it was better and went all out. And I couldn't help but feel befuddled as the rest of my crowd kept going crazy at certain parts. I was sadly jealous.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/26/2023)","

I do have to give ""props"" to the animatronics, as it look eerily accurate, but that's about where the similarities end sadly. The main story involving the main character is uninteresting, it's light on scares, the acting from the adults were very iffy (except Futterman, he always does a good job). I understand adopting a game story to a movie is difficult, but the plot is nearly nonsensical. Even if you can get past all that and at least expected a decent fun horror fest, the scariest thing was easily handled by some water and taser, and the main baddie was just a guy in a costume with a design flaw.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","smithcheyenne-01198","1 November 2023","The story for this movie is inept. Instead of just using the idea of kid friendly animatronics going hay wire and running amok, they went with this complex paranormal murder mystery story. I get that this is based on the graphic novels and not the games lore, but that doesn't justify this movies poor plot. There's very little horror and action. The characters spend most of their time chatting and arguing. It wasn't towards the end where it started feeling the games where the animatronics turn hostile and began attacking the human characters. Mathew Lillards character Afton is a poorly written villain. He only appeared in three scenes and just pops up in the end and we're supposed to be shocked that he was the children's killer. There were no hints or buildup at all to him being the killer but the character Vanessa reveals that she's his daughter and tells us everything we need to know about what her Dads crimes right before he comes out to kill Mike. It's also worth pointing out that Vanessa's last name is Kelly and she doesn't even have the last name as her Dad. Which is why we never saw the daughter plot twist coming. It also doesn't make sense how exactly Afton has control over the children's ghosts and is able to manipulate them into killing. In his final scene, Afton realizes that he's about to get his comeuppance from the animatronics and yells out ""I always come back!!"" For some reason the plot tries to make Afton out to be some kind of supernatural villain who can't be killed. It also doesn't make sense how the animatronics didn't know that Afton was the killer. Mikes little sister Abby had to draw a picture to explain to them that Afton was their killer to turn against him. I also can't figure out why Afton hired Mike as the night guard for his restaurant. I thought perhaps he wanted to lure him in there so he could kill him in privacy. But if that's the case then why did he wait five nights to do it? He also berates his daughter for failing to keep everything a secret from Mike and refusing to kill him if he found out the truth. Which makes me doubt that killing him himself was his motive.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Blazehgehg","28 December 2023","I am a lot older than FNAF's target demographic, but I'll admit, I had a phase where I was paying very close attention to the games. I could see there was a lot more going on beneath the surface than I think other people my age wanted to understand, and I could appreciate that. I never tumbled all the way down this rabbit hole like the kids did, but I knew enough.This is a very technically competent movie but it feels 100% laser targeted at existing fans of Freddy Fazbear. There are so many parts that, for people under the age of 18, are undoubtedly big epic lore references. But the movie does not do an especially great job at bridging the gap to those a little less familiar with things. You get the broad strokes, I guess, but there are mysteries that got teased out over the course of 4-5 games that are bluntly one and done here. It's the sort of thing that's only interesting if you're already familiar with the source material.Things about it feel really contrived for the sake of having a movie. Like the fact that Josh Hutcherson is over 30, but he's the big brother to a little girl who is maybe 8 years old? Mom and Dad don't seem to be in the picture anymore because, what, Mom gave birth when she was pushing 50? Or what about the whole thing with the guy taking drugs so he can repeatedly hallucinate the day his little brother was abducted in order to uncover some sort of deeper meaning? It's pretty bizarre.Also how about the fact this movie just isn't scary? Like, at all? Even if you consider the games to be simple jump scare factories, the movie does an extremely poor job replicating that mood. It's too busy with fandom wish fulfillment to remember to be scary. I'm surprised they even bothered trying to show blood, because that is not the tone this movie is trying to convey.I'm not even sure it's worth singing praise for Jim Henson Creature Shop here, given how simple these designs are, and how deliberately stiff and stilted the characters move. Feels like a waste of talent.Honestly, as someone who used to like these games back in the day, I was ultimately pretty bored by this whole production. It wasn't necessarily offensive or anything, but it definitely was not good.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jonny-07642","8 November 2023","When I was leaving the cinema I saw a film promotion of paw patrol and wasn't sure if I just witnessed the right movie which was supposed to be Friday night at Freddie's. The security guard spent the first 3 nights sleeping on the job. By the 4th night, he was told that there was ghosts within 5 seconds, he was okay with it and they were all laughing and dancing. Chuck in the mix of the taxi driver comedy scenes and the big giant robot getting in a cab and it was like what?! I can kind of get younger fans feeling some nostalgia but it was just dull for an apparent scary movie. The story was all over the place, some of which made no sense. Some reviews suggest tension or edge of your seat stuff, my advice to them people, never watch the ring or the grudge, you'll never sleep with the lights off again. However I will be fair some of the actors tried, not all but some. I genuinely think this movie could have been a lot better but based on some of the positive reviews, it was solely created for the true fans. If you really want to watch or have been conned by the trailer, I would advise to maybe rent on a stream platform when available.","

The audience score for this film is either artificially inflated or people just don't demand absolutely anything from films they watch now.The literal second the blonde cop shows up, I looked at my partner and stated ""oh! The love interest is here!""Everything about this film is telegraphed a mile away. There is an attempt to build a sense of dread but the film shows its hand almost immediately. The video game this is based on does so much better of a job building a sense of dread.Once you see the the animatronics in full CGI glory it's over. All tension, all scariness. All the air goes out of the room and I'm like ""Ah, cartoons. So Scary!""It's also obvious immediately that the ghost kids want the little girl. That the thugs the woman hired are going to quickly die. Even the cop being the villain's daughter, the big reveal, was not in any way surprising or shocking.Mr Blum, this film could've been so much better with better writing. I'm available. Lol.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","gavthyname","25 October 2023","Not easy porting a lot of gaming moments from the games into this movie. But somehow it's fun with a good back story. The core of the games is still very well represented.The brother and sister storyline is solid The whole story how the robots are being controlled was a nice spin on things. And everyone did a solid job.No doubt Blumhouse badly want this to succeed I hope it does because it deserves a sequel to carry on the story. There's a lot they could do here.Overall this was some serious fun , pure popcorn wasn't heavy on gore so no doubt Blumhouse will do an unrated cut . Megan would play well with these new friends.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","vassiliskounelis","28 November 2023","Five Nights at Freddy's had the potential to be a standout horror film, but it ultimately falls flat in execution. Despite being billed as a horror movie, the PG-13 rating seems to hinder its ability to deliver genuine scares. The film struggles with its identity, wavering between psychological horror, mystery, and slasher genres without committing to any. This lack of direction leaves the audience with a sense of confusion and disappointment. In theory, it could have been something significant, but in reality, it ends up as a basic and forgettable attempt at the horror genre.A Missed Opportunity""","

I guess I'm one of few that loved Five Nights at Freddy's which is fine that's common with me I have I autism I enjoy a lot of movies most don't as much, plenty of my favorites are guilty pleasures. Anyways I love how this reminded me of 3 other movies Sinister which is masterful but much darker than Five Nights at Freddy's, the other 2 are Scream and Nightmare on elm street the Similarities are brilliant plus I don't know much about the video games I'm pretty sure the director perfected everything based on the games. The terror is great, story flows well, cast is superb, comedy is awesome, and to me a lot of the movie is spectacular!","

My young cousin who lives in Florida is a crazy fan of five nights at Freddy's . After seeing this movie tonight I say it was really awesome and crazy wild with loads of fans kids , teenagers , and young adults like myself. The story was so incredible and very wild and it did have some intense moments where one is the people got cut in half by Freddy fuzzbear, foxy really had a way with stocking her victims , chica really knows how to find ways of winning a fight . The rest of the characters from five nights at Freddy's were really awesome , scary and uh very intense robots . William who was dressed as the yellow bunny was so crazy . I hope they do a directors cut where they're more scenes and hopefully and alternate ending .","

Finally a film that has a story line that makes sense, and isn't full of innapropriate romance scenes.The story line itself is pretty good, and the jump scares are enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting is on parr and i think they just did a really good job. My kids who love the fnaf game said there were so many good nods to the games, and were excited to watch it. All in all, a pretty good movie and a good movie for your first horror film if you're a kid.","

He has been so excited to see this movie & as parents we were hoping it wouldn't be too gory. This was just the right amount of scary that he didn't want to walk to his room alone, but not enough he didn't need to sleep in my bed afterwards. That's a good level of scare, just enough he enjoyed it, not so much he couldn't watch it.It also was entertaining enough we were able to watch it as a family. Matthew Lillard for the parents, Josh Hutchinson for the kids.Visually the movie was flawless. & All your favorite bits were in the movie! We got to watch this the day before it came out on theaters due to streaming it on Peacock which was also really nice.Overall the entire family was impressed & hoping for a sequel that's just as good!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","aaschoone","27 October 2023","First off I would like to say I have never played the games but I watched the game theory videos when I was younger and thought the lore was interesting but never got too into the franchise. Despite this I genuinely enjoyed the film. The horror in the film is more like security breach where there are jump-scares but they are very predictable and not too scary. The plot is really where the movie shines, it's surprisingly sweet and had me hooked. The ending could have been better and felt rushed but thats only the real part that felt that way and everything else was great. There is so much here for longtime fans of the franchise and I think that you will really enjoy this if you love the games. ""Tl;dr"" critic reviews made it seem terrible when it's not that bad.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","kmkevinn-64733","26 October 2023","So the only three characters that are interested was Mike & Abby Schmidt, Vanessa Monroe (COP) and Aunt Jane. The horror was darker tone to it and it wished it went an Hard R Rated horror that way it would of made more sense.Coming out of watching the film last night, I have to say that this film does not meet the expectations that I had as a fan. It is worth saying that the film was not awful, but I had felt that it gave the impression that the script was rushed and very choppy to say the least. The film failed in the aspect that it was more focused on appealing to the general audience, however this is a huge weakness of this film, rather than sticking to the original material( which is difficult, especially it is a video game) the film feels like a huge jumbled mess of cameos. Unfortunately I was wrong. I knew that it would be very unlikely (and probably difficult) to follow directly to the lore. The movie had aspects from the lore but it just felt all jumbled together, especially the 'I always come back' scene, kind of cheesy and it felt forced. The movies storyline was rather random, bringing in two random characters which make no sense. The only good things about it was with the animatronics design and how the end with spring bonnie entering but just a heads up for those who have not watched it. DO NOT WATCH IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THE LORE, THE WHOKE AND LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS. It does not link to lore at all. The story was off track and had security breach and FNAF 1 together. Two different time periods, two ends of the spectrum literally. The acting was amazing imo, but that was about it. The ""Springlock"" scene was super hype at first but as it continued it was so demoralising. It was more like an PG horror back in the 70's towards early mid 80's. So, the entire theatre/streaming services like peacock was making jokes about it, laughing, and overall mocking the film because it was so childish. Most people had dressed up for the occasion but only ended up ruining it with the shouting of matpat showing and shouting over the iconic lines and just chucked them all in at random points. I respect the actors for they did amazing but the script did them not justice throughout the film and had led them to not having the praise they deserve. They went away the aspect of being able to see them and to only see how the tracing back to his dreams at those moments. The advertising and hype for the movie but shows that it had none of realism of the games have and not having all the iconic moments when they were necessary. The fact that springtrap under going the springlock with not much blood or gore and the fact that it had happened then just went over and gabbed the mask before saying 'i will always come back' and just carried on and getting dragged away. It gave no context on the pain that would have been shown. They could have stuck with the lore and not try to focus on a hidden message. It most certainly did not deliver the hype & expectations of the audience whatsoever, despite stating on news interviews that they have delivered what the fans would want, I beg to differ. There was barely any soundtrack or sounds linked to the games which might have made the experience better or might have been able to add more context for the fans to appreciate. The only noticeable sound or song which was in the film was living tombstone which only appeared right at the end. The movie had aspects from the lore but it just felt all jumbled together, especially the 'I always come back' scene, kind of cheesy and it felt forced.The movies storyline was rather random, bringing in two random characters which make no sense? Abby/Abbie (I don't know what way it's spelt) there was absolutely no point in her, making the film corny with the 'oh I see ghosts and they're my friends!!😆' trope and don't even get me started on the table scene. I get that it was just some fun and all, but it just didn't feel like FNAF. In the game lore Mike was William's son so even if that link was made it would've been better. Also random point but it would've been cooler with some gore, like an actual springlock scene or being stuffed inside a suit since those are big things in the games.Maybe I'm just being too critical but I guess I'm just mildly disappointed. I'm sure some people loved the film and fair for them! Everyone has their own opinions. I just feel like it could've been written a lot better rather than a film which was trying a little too hard to appeal to fans with the mushed up storyline, when it had so much potential. (Literally could've just watched a few game theory videos and followed that story and it would've been a lot better.) The movie did have some good things to it, like the few Easter eggs (sparky was cool!) and also the cameo appearances were cool, like the living tombstone song at the end! The Animatronics were very well made too! The actors did a good job as well. To be honest even if they did make a sequel, I'd still watch it. I'll always love FNAF and just hope that if there was another movie it'd be better.The end of the day, I hated when we get like off screen kills just a plan shadow, it does frustrates that intention, Willy's Wonderland was a better film because Nick Cage does not use dialogue in this film only screams and yells, The Banana Spilts Movie was similar because animatronics was designed differently and when the computer system was created an demonic animatronics then it did have on screen kills. If you really want to watch something without dialogue watch Willy's Wonderland (Skip Five Nights AT Freddy's). If you wanted to watch something that talks about the last performance with animatronics and a demonic computer hack system and went on a decent path, watch The Banana Splits Movie (Skip Five Nights AT Freddy's). This is a 3/10 it's not like I hated the movie with hot relish and/or two hours lost it did however have positive factors but nothing that would make me feel enjoyable.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","atarilord","4 November 2023","I went into this somewhat blindfolded, cause I haven't seen any trailers or a lot of promo material and just was fantastic. I loved the attention to detail in this from the smallest of nods to how the animatronics are actual working ones instead of CGI to how well the cinematography was. Saw this in Xtreme Screen and it was so worth it. Took two of my friends to see it with me and it was the same reaction. I would say if you know the basics of the game you will love this, but if you have no clue about them, maybe give it a skip. Once the credits started to roll, hand were clapping, because of how great this was.","

He had a good review so I watched it on Peacock, we both agree visually it was flawless 10/10 and if you're familiar with the storyline in the games it does follow it but adds more to it to flesh it out, also for the original fans there are a lot of Easter eggs dropped in as well as fan work such as the music came from fans, he said you could tell the true fans in the theater when a song played and half the theater cheered simply because they recognized and added it. I liked the keeping with the main story and was so so with the added bits. If you loved the games there's a lot to like but if you are unfamiliar and just are watching as a stand alone movie you probably won't like it as much.

I really liked the work they put into this film, and including a lot of background scenes about Mike. Jump-scares are incredibly done, and the animatronics are terrifying! The overall plot of the movie was well maintained, and had me on the edge of my seat for the whole length of the film. Very little CGI was used, really bringing the animatronics to life. For diehard fans of the original game released back in 2014, the movie set, from my observations, was exact! Fantastic film overall, 10 stars!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","I_Ailurophile","27 October 2023","My videogame experience is so minimal and consistently out of date that the colloquial term ""casual"" is probably too intensive to describe me. With that in mind, and with much more significant interest in cinema, I approached this strictly with concern for how it would come off as a full-length feature, and as a horror feature, with its gaming roots no more than a tertiary curiosity for me. Illustrating the point, I was less interested about any faithfulness as an adaptation than I was about comparing this 2023 flick to 2019's 'The Banana Splits movie,' and 2021's 'Willy's Wonderland,' both of which work with a very similar concept, and about seeing where this fit into the oeuvre of filmmaker Emma Tammi, as by happenstance I've seen all her previous work in the genre. And still all such matters are beside the point: how is 'Five night's at Freddy's?' I had my doubts, but in every regard this is a lot of fun, and it ably delivers the genre flavors we crave; for my part I'm happy to say that I think this is actually really great!I'll say this, it's definitely not what I expected; for the different directions that this took I admit I was a little taken aback. I think the end result does struggle a bit: with tone, with cohesiveness, with pacing, and possibly with feeling a tad common for the path it does walk, while not taking full advantage of the principal imagery (and game mechanics) for which the game franchise is best known (even for an outsider like me). We do certainly get tastes of the animatronics stalking the halls of the restaurant and playhouse, and with smart use of (among other things) lighting, cinematography, editing, and stunts and effects, these scenes are meaningfully creepy and sinister. Yet this is actually the least of what FNAF pursues in its narrative, and while I'm told that the plot does draw on what I gather is the jumbled lore of the games, the various elements it weaves in seem imbalanced and unwieldy. We get flavors of straight horror-thriller, psychological thriller, and supernatural horror; the flick spends just as much or maybe even more time delving into the troubled personal life of protagonist Mike - his past trauma, his shoddy work history, his difficult relationship with his sister, and more. This is all part of a complete story, yes, but in the front end the telling comes across as confused, and in the back end it's overfull and strained as the script tries to neatly tie together all the varied pieces. However much this does or doesn't correlate to the videogame franchise, I think the film maybe just tries to do too much, and it might have benefited from some aspects having been left out.Even with these critiques firmly in mind, however, by and large 'Five nights at Freddy's' is gratifyingly sharp, and it's genuinely better than I could have hoped. It's readily evident how much care went into this from every angle, an endeavor to make the adaptation the best it could be, and to make something that could appeal to all comers. And just so: my friends who are deeply invested in the games told me that they were happy with the picture in terms of its relation to the source material; in my opinion it's solid and satisfying in and of itself as a horror picture. With the Jim Henson Creature Shop having crafted the animatronics, there could never be any doubt that Freddy and his friends look outstanding, and for that matter - not to count out anyone else's contributions, but they might well be the top highlight in these two hours. The stunts, effects, and art direction are top notch, and bring to vibrant life the aesthetics that anyone with passing awareness of the games will recognize in an instant. And while I'm not especially familiar with anyone in the cast, I'm very pleased with just how good the acting is here. Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, and even young Piper Rubio, among others, give meaningful weight and human heart to their characters and in turn to the proceedings; even as the tale oscillates between ideas, the actors serve as an anchor to help keep the title steady amidst any perceived difficulties.It's worth observing that while 'Willy's Wonderland' was an unremitting, unabashed horror-comedy romp, 'The Banana Splits movie' took a different tack and rooted those same flavors in an earnest sidelong exploration of the relationship between mother and child, and the significance of childhood innocence - while also, regrettably, lacking the utmost punch that would have helped its horror or comedy to land. I bring this up because FNAF fits rather neatly between these two spiritual predecessors: more grounded and earnest than the riotous Nicolas Cage vehicle, and boasting more vitality than the Hanna-Barbera blast. The writing team concocted an amalgamated story and a screenplay that try to split the difference between humor, violence, and heartfelt beats, and while none of these are specifically as strong as in the kindred flicks, the result is a fine success all the same, warts and all. For the genre purists in the audience, I would even argue that of the three FNAF might well offer the most pure horror experience. Employing the same finessed, delicate hand that she demonstrated even in first full-length feature 'The wind,' in 2018, or in 2021's 'Blood moon,' director Tammi swirls these facets together as smoothly as she can to keep the whole centered. The carnage may not be as visceral or heavily visualized, the emotional beats may not hit as hard, and the humor may not be as robust as we get elsewhere, yet the combination of them all is admirably sure-footed. Even if I hadn't previously dallied with Tammi's other works, on the basis of this alone I look forward to watching her career develop.For any number of reasons this won't appeal to all, and for any number of reasons it will not meet with equal favor among all. Videogame connoisseur, film buff, ""casual"" appreciator of fiction generally - there are a lot of ways to consider this, and there are a lot of ways it could have gone wrong (and may have, depending on one's perspective). All I know is that I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I sat in the theater, and even though I don't think it's perfect, the strength it can claim handily outweighs its faults and shortcomings. I had a swell time with this, and think it ably scratches the itch for whatever it is one might want out of horror entertainment. I really am of the mind that it's something anyone could appreciate, whatever level of familiarity with the games one might bring to the viewing experience. It's not something that wholly demands viewership, but it stands tall on its own legs, and if one has any passing interest then it's well worth checking out. 'Five nights at Freddy's' is a minor delight as far as I'm concerned, and I'm glad to give it my recommendation!","

this movie does answer some things but it really doesn't if you're a fan of the games you kinda already expect the story to go exactly when it does and it falls so flat on its delivery of ground breaking plot reveals this movie thinks it has
they ruined the animatronics they had them building forts and laying down under the stars with our main characters
the acting is piss poor ngl
all and all i went to see this with my girlfriend and she hasn't ever played the game but she was so bored we kept waiting and waiting for it to get good and it never did near the last 15 mins they gave us a bit of fan service and things fans of the games will be happy baout but like i said it fails to really hit home on its reveals and ""wow"" moments in my cinema people clapped and it made me very mad that movie didn't deserve the claps it was getting
i walked out of the cinema legitimately depressed i was so disappointed we waited 9 years for this movie and it failed to deliver on everything the only thing they got spot on was the visuals the setting and everything looked incredible but this movie it falls flat on everything else no matter if you're a die hard fan like me or a causal movie goer like my girlfriend

"Five Nights at Freddy's","comps-784-38265","27 October 2023","This looked to be a really good horror and certainly started off well enough, so I began watching in some anticipation.It doesn't take long before you realise this film doesn't know if it's a horror, a ghost story or a suspense thriller (and nor does the audience)As predictable as a Scooby Doo Cartoon (complete with the actor who played shaggy in the film)It ruins the good start with lots of WTF? Plot holes.The big failing is using writers who clearly think the audience are idiots. Who won't ask silly questions like 'how did 5 bodies and all the blood and gore get cleared up? Or this was portrayed as supernatural now it's become mechanical - which is it.The writing is lazy and glib, throw in a nasty auntie because they can't think of any more credible reasons for X and Y to happenIt starts off respectably enough but you soon realise it's garbage . Shame as I think the storyline had real potential.Seeing many of the 10/10 reviews 'best film ever' from first time users confirm my suspicions that reivews are paid for or bogus or both.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","olcare","29 October 2023","When I first started watching the movie, it drew me in with its visuals and intrigue. However, when I reached the end of the film, I truly couldn't believe how poorly they concluded it.First of all, the makeup, costumes, and visuals were quite good. But apart from that, the other elements were not satisfying at all.I couldn't understand why they tried to commercialize the script. The idea of finding children's spirits inside robotic monsters was just unbelievable. Also, the character Vanessa, who didn't do her job throughout the film but was only involved in the events because her father was in charge, really dragged the film down. Let me first address what I initially mentioned. Whoever came up with the idea of searching for his brother in a dream and communicating with the child spirits inside robotic monsters did a really bad job. Instead of turning this into more of a detective thriller and strengthening the family drama (now I'm moving on to the second point, Vanessa), they gave Vanessa's character a very simple and elementary-level script connection to her father, William Afton. The absence of police in the events or the incomplete presentation of any mystery element is a total disaster for the film. Like I said, if they had turned this material into a detective-style thriller, they would have created a much stronger film.In short, the movie,although visually beautiful, was ruined by an unsuccessful script that tested my patience and tried to be meta but couldn't. You can see this from the ratings on all movie review sites. Our time is precious and this movie is not worth it.","

I understand that one has to make some modifications to the original source, but I feel like the reason why movies or series made of loved videogames fall short is because they very often become so different from the original source and either add or change story lines that don't require any change, which just makes it weird for the viewer if they happen to be a fan.I think producers and directors should have learnt from the last of us adaptation, since it's one of the most well received adaptations like this. When you make this kind of content for the fans, use the source they already love. I'm probably going to see the second movie if they do end up making it, I'm not gonna lie, because I love the games and I wish the next one would be catered towards the fans who have waited years for this sort of a movie.I think the movie is still worth a watch, esprecially if you go into the movie expecting more of a humoristic spooky movie, don't really care about the details of the games and just want to see the animatronics come to life, I'm sure you'll enjoy it more! I just might have had a bit unrealistic expectations and the hype around the movie got to me.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","bbunfazbearxul","28 October 2023","Why does it look so much like another fnaf fanfiction? In these phrases there is nothing recognizable from the original series, except perhaps the animatronics themselves, as if this film is trying hard to seem like canon, but it's not him. And judging by the introduction, I can already say that this film will be a weak thriller of category B for the young target audience of fnaf, BRAVO SCOTT!!It was once a horror, but it became a children's entertainment, because it is more profitable to work for a children's audience...The ending where Steve Raglan (William Afton) dies from spring locks in a springbonnie suit is literally taken from Scott Cawton's 2017 book silver eyes, but unlike the book version, where the suit slams shut because he was pushed away by the main protagonist Charlie, whom he took hostage, then in the film spring locks are triggered from for the fact that an animatronic cupcake jumps on Springbonnie, biting off part of the belly of the suit and touching these springs...... What a cringe......The villain himself, William Afton, did not seem interesting to me from the word at all, an ordinary sadist. For the children's audience for which this film is designed, it may work, but as a character it is empty and simplified.The costumes, especially the Springbonnie costume, look worse than many fan cosplay costumes. I mean, William Afton's suit looks bulky, carelessly made, as if the designers did not even try to make a nice costume design, and the material from which it is made looks like some kind of sponge.The pizzeria itself, especially the office, has absolutely no atmosphere of the first part, and looks cardboard. In fact, everything in this movie looks hastily done. As if the creators abandoned this project for years and after a long time decided to make a film with the most simplified story and collect money from the youngest audience.I'm not waiting for a sequel or prequel, because as a true fan of the series, I don't want to suffer seeing how fnaf buries itself deeper into the grave. Not that I expected some very atmospheric and dark thriller with a very charismatic film adaptation of William Afton, but in my opinion it turned out to be the worst option.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","tmccarter-15709","28 October 2023","Creating a story in the context of a franchise like FNAF should have been a relatively straightforward task, given the rich lore and established characters. However, it appears that the creators managed to falter in significant ways. While the visual elements of the movie, such as the scenery and costume designs, were commendable to some extent, these superficial aspects should have been just the tip of the iceberg.The fundamental issue lies in the mishandling of the established lore and the names of the characters. FNAF already possesses a complex and intriguing backstory, and it is disappointing to witness how the film failed to honor and expand upon it in a meaningful way. Instead of capitalizing on the well-established universe, the creators appear to have disregarded it, leaving fans and enthusiasts deeply unsatisfied.Vanessa's character, purportedly intended to lead a suspenseful narrative, was one of the movie's glaring disappointments. Her portrayal lacked depth and substance, rendering her unable to effectively carry the weight of the story, ultimately resulting in a dramatic failure.Additionally, the movie's pacing left much to be desired. A well-constructed horror narrative relies on a careful balance between tension and release, but it seems that the film failed to strike this equilibrium. The result was a viewing experience that felt disjointed and lacked the necessary buildup and payoffs expected from a FNAF adaptation.In conclusion, it is regrettable to witness the mismanagement of such a promising concept. While the visual elements demonstrated some effort, the core elements of storytelling and character development fell far short of what the FNAF franchise and its dedicated fanbase deserved. The film's shortcomings raise questions about the decision-making processes involved in its creation and the missed opportunity to create a compelling addition to the FNAF universe.","

Well I hate to say this but, this movie isnt how I expected it to be! Everyone in this film was good with performances! Some moments are just plain stupid. For my personal opinion, It's an unfunny, non scary, horror film that tries too hard to be scary and funny! It's good for younger people bc it's not intense but this movie was flat as anything for me and extremely boring.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","kristianryder","25 October 2023","This movie has all the feelings of a great idea but with no conviction. As a horror movie it sucks big style and as a comedy it isn't much better. The actors act like they just want a pay check. There are some ""scary scenes"" but they just aren't scary, they are predictable. You will not be jumping out of your seat to this film. I want to say something good about it but there is just so little. The whole movie just has an air of cheap new actors and old has beens. It is also way too long for a movie of this appallingness. 88 to 91 minutes would have sufficed but they made it 110 minutes for no obvious reason. Just an extra 20 minutes for the poor punter to endure. My advice is to just not bother....you will thank me for it in the long run.","

The cop lady was saying the weird things. She said she can't help him but yet come and saved his ass without even struggling with the fact that the person he was gonna have to shoot is her dad.The main character said at once point that the cop was scared in the back room when they were there cause he saw it in her eyes but yet the actor didn't look scared at all.Feel like all of the plot points ended in a weird way.For example aunt wanting the girl for money. It ended by having animatics kill the aunt then try to take the girl.The plot overall was boring, weirdly done and not in a good way.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","ian-47918","2 November 2023","Written by Ian Chandler - November 2, 2023Almost a decade after the first ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" video-game won the attention of the internet, Scott Cawthon finally adapts his beloved horror franchise into a motion picture. Fantasy and fun come to life with its impressive practical effects and even more impressive budget. Even so, the film gets lost when translated from its spooky, but tween friendly games. It, most fatally, completely forgets its most famous trademarks: suspense and jump scares. It should not be expected to be a work of art, but at the very least, the screenplay should not leave all of the heavy-lifting to the production team.As mentioned previously, those who produced the visual aspects of ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" are exceptional on ensuring that the pizzeria is how a fan would imagine it. It's dark, dusty, but also colorful. The technology in the abandoned pizzeria is appropriately dated. Additionally, in an industry so reliant on the use of CGI, it was refreshing to see Freddy and his pals as real animatronics. So much love and care were put into the world Scott Cawthon created that it stings a bit more that the film's other elements are as empty as an animatronics' endoskeleton.The plot is not as bad as it could have been, but it still never feels polished, nor fresh. It features an upsetting story about a sad protagonist, with tragedies brought up throughout. It is accurate in many ways to the plot of the third game; unfortunately, plot points are brought up repeatably without much progression in order to satisfy the nearly two-hour runtime. When plot elements demand for more substance, they are sidelined for the recurring objective put in place, resulting in an abrupt ending overall and a lack of resolution for certain parts that happen near the end. Characters during the first two acts are serviceable with some good acting, most notably from Josh Hutcherson. When the second act starts to close, the dialogue becomes increasingly wooden and the actors try their best to combat the lackluster script by conveying emotion in the tired phrases given to them.Despite the forgettable plot and uneven characters, a horror film can usually stand on two feet if it provides what they promise: suspense. This, strangely, is where the movie is at its weakest. There is not a second where one's heartrate rises, nor is there a moment to cling on to the seat in fear. The animatronics, furthermore, are too expressive compared to their video-game counterparts; this results in impressive facial movements, but a less impressive method of intimidation. Part of what made the games creepy was their lack of visual movement and their corpse-like faces. The violent sequences, however, are creative, given the fact it is appropriately aimed at younger teenagers. Gore is obscured with clever shadows, impacts are reasonably cut at the last second to not only censor, but also to keep it from appearing cheesy. When it does not remember to cut at the right time, the result is usually very silly; which could possibly be the point when regarding its 1980s theme.""Five Nights at Freddy's,"" almost seems purposeful in its lack of creepiness as tonal inconsistencies emerge as an enormous problem. About halfway in, the film turns from a slightly unsettling adventure into a tone reminiscent of a bubbly montage found in many Chuck-e-Cheese home videos. It's inorganic, and any suggestion of a spine-chilling blockbuster evaporates at this point. It almost suggests that multiple drafts of the film were sloppily merged together. It attempts to tread back to perilous moments later on, but interest in the unfinished plot is alarmingly small by the time it gets there.With all of that said, ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is better than any movie about a point-and-click game has any right to be. It is simply bothersome that it could have been drastically more enjoyable had the plot added more depth and the atmosphere remain similar to its source material. It is about guaranteed that the film will receive an endless supply of sequels, with a spark of hope that it only goes up from here. This first entry, however, does not make a good impression for the franchise going forward. If the screenwriter were to be changed for a more experienced one, improvements could be of large proportions.Five Nights at Freddy's - 56/100""Five Nights at Freddy's"" may have the fantasy going for it, but the removal of scares and fun prevent it from truly coming to life.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","sofiamotaneto","27 October 2023","If you have zero knowledge about the games this is a nice watch (if you don't think much), however if you do it will be both confusing an disappointing (Do still watch it though),Firstly, all the characters and family relationships are really mixed up, all of William Afton's motives for killing children is gone. For some reason Vanessa is William's daughter instead of Mike, who had his younger brother Garrett (supposedly CC) kidnapped (what?!?) and is taking care of his sister Abby (who?!?). What I mean is fnaf has very (VERY) deep and confusing lore, but the writers had Scott to ask questions, there were a lot of good stories opportunities about what is already known about the stories (like following mike going from restaurant to restaurant, etc).Even if you don't know the franchise, there are a lot of plot holes, like the five children are in the animatronics (freddy, bonnie, chica, foxy, and I guess cupcake?), but where did Garrett go? Why are some children in animatronics and other not. Also, why would William want to employ Mike? He had no reason to kill him, is it just for fun orrr???I enjoyed the movie, the acting is nice and its well filmed, it isn't scary, but it's not bad. It went above my expectations (they were really low), except in that one scene where the animatronics are all laying down in the ""tent"", that was the only real horror in the movie... Anyways, I think Mike is a good character, but Vanessa is useless and only there for exposition and ""HE IS MY FATHER!!!"".I say watch it and make your own opinion about it.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","tysa-35312","29 October 2023","I love horror games and FNAF although I haven't played them all that much, was always high on my list for top scariest games I've ever played. So this movie should be right up my ally right? Well not in this case. The movie focuses on hitting that feature film length so much that you get a jumbled story with so much going on that the movie ends up just leaving you behind. Oh and Animatronics we're great for the 5 minutes they were on screen.The characters are not interesting at all and that's a shame because we are stuck following the main character Mike through un interesting repetitive dream sequences that lead to nothing. The others acted in such an non human way, it throws you out of the illusion.This movie had a story already written out that scared so many people already, why they didn't just stick to that and flesh out the already told story is beyond me. They need to tone it down and stick to what they already have if they plan on doing anything else with the franchise.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","georgeketland","30 October 2023","Five Nights at Freddy's, the highly anticipated adaptation of the popular video game series, has finally made its way to the silver screen. As a big fan of the original games, I approached this release with great enthusiasm, hoping for a bone-chilling, suspenseful experience that would do justice to its gaming origins. However, much to my dismay, this cinematic endeavor left much to be desired. Despite a few redeeming qualities, I regret to say that the final product only deserves a 4/10 rating.The film, directed by a promising newcomer in the industry, had the potential to be a horror masterpiece. The premise, which centers around a security guard surviving nights at a haunted animatronic-filled pizzeria, was ripe for suspense and terror. Sadly, it fell flat in execution, leaving me longing for the scares that never came.One of the biggest disappointments of Five Nights at Freddy's was the lackluster character development. The film introduced a cast of intriguing characters, from the tormented security guard to the mysterious animatronics. However, their potential was squandered, and we were left with underdeveloped, two-dimensional figures who lacked depth and personality. We needed a reason to care about their fates, but it never came.Moreover, the film's pacing was sluggish. While the games are known for their slow-building tension, the movie felt like an interminable waiting game, much like the protagonist's nightly vigil. Instead of suspense, we were subjected to long stretches of monotony, punctuated by occasional, tepid jump-scares that failed to evoke the heart-pounding fear we hoped for.Speaking of jump-scares, this is where the film truly faltered. The jump-scares were lukewarm at best. In a horror movie, these moments should be used to jolt the audience out of their seats, leaving them breathless and terrified. Unfortunately, Five Nights at Freddy's seemed to mistake repetition for effectiveness. The animatronics' predictable and lackluster appearances drained the film of any shock value. It was a missed opportunity to genuinely scare the audience.The film's lack of innovation in its presentation was a significant letdown. While the source material is known for its unique and eerie atmosphere, the movie failed to capture that same sense of dread. The pizzeria, a central element of the story, felt uninspired, and the film lacked the creepy ambiance that made the games so unsettling. The creators could have drawn inspiration from the games to create a more immersive and visually arresting experience, but it felt like a wasted opportunity.Five Nights at Freddy's also suffered from a disjointed and incoherent narrative. The film hopped between different time periods and perspectives, leaving viewers confused and detached from the story. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to cram too much of the game's lore into a single film, resulting in a messy and convoluted plot. It was difficult to invest in the story when it lacked cohesion and clarity.The film's visuals, while decent, failed to stand out in the crowded genre of horror. The animatronics, despite being a central element of the story, looked more comical than terrifying. The use of practical effects was commendable, but their execution left much to be desired. A sense of eeriness and uncanny valley realism was missing, leaving a significant void in the horror department.One aspect of the film that did shine was the soundtrack. The haunting and discordant score created an atmosphere of unease, which was one of the few elements that managed to maintain the tension in certain scenes. The music, composed by a talented artist, was a testament to the film's potential, but it alone couldn't salvage the entire project.In the end, Five Nights at Freddy's was a missed opportunity in the world of horror cinema. With the right direction, character development, pacing, and innovative presentation, it could have been a genre-defining masterpiece. Unfortunately, it fell short of those expectations, delivering a lukewarm experience that left me yearning for the true terror and suspense that the source material promises.In conclusion, the film was a disappointment to fans of the game series and casual moviegoers alike. It lacked the necessary elements to make it a compelling and truly horrifying experience. With a more skillful adaptation, it could have been a standout entry in the horror genre. However, as it stands, Five Nights at Freddy's deserves a 4/10 rating, reflecting its inability to fulfill its potential and deliver the scares that audiences were hoping for.","

I can genuinely not see any reason someone might enjoy this amateurish nothing burger of a movie other than because of a knee jerk positive reaction to seeing matpat or Freddy fazbear or the other animatronics on screen. Just a movie pumped out to grab some extra dollars for the owners and film companies by capitalizing on a name that will be forgotten as soon as it leaves theatres. I'd skip this one, it is not worth your time no matter what you think of the games or the property.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","backup-50362","28 October 2023","It was fine until exactly 1 hour and 10 minutes, when the generic exposition cop woman randomly threatened to shoot the main character for no reason whatsoever. Until then I was like ""this is fine - fan service, a predictable insertion of tons of female characters because it's the 2020s, a kids rating, so no violence, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad, so overall - nothing too surprising or bad.""But yeah, the cringe factor got cranked up so hard in those 5 seconds that I legit stopped watching it, because I lost all interest, this is bad. I should've expected it to be cringe and misandrist considering it's proudly directed by the same woman who made M3gan, I guess, but I did expect some competence.But yeah, overall, it's a really bland and generic movie based on a game that had no lore whatsoever until a youtuber pulled some out of his rear end for views, singlehandedly creating some (bad one).That same youtuber also has a really corny cameo, I guess for the kids to cheer over, but... yeah...Cringe.To be fair, though, the visual presentation is great, and the acting is surprisingly good, at least from the main guy. He goes above and beyond with what he gets to work with - a silly movie with a ridiculous plot - but he carries his weight and shows a great range of emotion throughout. Too bad his efforts were wasted in a movie this bad.","

Due to the silly nature of shots, scenes, and acting, you will be sure to forget that it is not a comedy flick. The acting performances were less than stellar, sad to say that includes Matthew Lillard. The film has its charm, and is sure to become a cult classic in the following years.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","pinklightswitch","1 November 2023","There's some good stuff in there, the animatronics look pretty great but they also were good about using sound effects to show their weight, there were a couple times that they could have shown off their strength as well but at least they feel heavy. The music was also decent though it isn't really in the movie a ton. The shot composition was pretty good and there were some pretty good looking shots, they definitely got creative with it. The sets were also pretty good they definitely sold what they were going for.However that's where most of my praise ends and I think the other stuff in the movie plunges it into a negative score. I think that they could have made the movie scary, there definitely were attempts at being scary but none of them really amounted to much and sometimes they were just comical. For example when Bonnie kills the old guy with long hair sometime into the movie the shot is composed as if it were a joke, like a bit about a guy who doesn't know that a thing is behind him, now if this was supposed to be a joke I'd say it was a bad place to put it but the only reason I think it might have been a joke is that the movie seems to be self aware about how not scary it is, when the bad ballon boy jumpscare happened I thought it was very dumb, then they did it twice and I was really confused and then in the post credit scene they do it again but as a joke, which makes me think that it was always supposed to be a joke but in the first 2 scenes where they do the jumpscare it seems to be to put you on edge so I'm not exactly sure what they were going for.I am also am very mixed about the characters, the main lead is fine, he doesn't have much of a personality or any interests outside of the plot and doesn't really feel like a person in any way and that's not helped by the actor just not doing a good job, he's pretty monotone for most of the movie but when he's supposed to be worked up he felt very reserved. His sister I have less to say about, she is a child character in a modern horror movie she's mostly there to be a plot device and it goes without saying that her acting is very not good. Vanessa is a white woman unsurprisingly, she's written a little odd but that might be on purpose and she does feel a bit shoved in at points but she's fine and her actor is also doing a fine job. William Afton is kind of interesting because he isn't completely new and is very different from his in game counterpart and I really don't like him here, from his first line he definitely seems off and they kinda lean into you kinda knowing that he's the yellow rabbit but unfortunately we can't really see much of him at all because I'm guessing Mathew Lilard was too much money for him to actually be in the movie because he is in two scenes on two sets one where he's trying to act normal but failing and the scene where he dies which is extremely lame and tame compared to the game or even some deaths in this movie I could probably go into more detail about the stuff I don't like about this William but I can only comment so much on a character that's in the movie for 5 minutesI also feel like the way they changed the plot from how it was in FNAF one makes some things less interesting, like how the pizzeria is abandoned instead of in the games where they are usually open and the night guard is there for what feels like an actual reason, the reason there's a night guard feel more contrived and it also disallows any scenes of the pizzeria in the day which I guess allows them to save in budget because they'd have to hire a ton of extras but it effectively removes some of the interest that was present in the games having to do with how this haunted pizza joint was also a semi popular spot when you aren't there. There are also smaller things like the animatronics stuffing people being removed and replaced with a Freddy mask ""SAW"" style contraption which I'm guessing is to keep the pg-13 rating since the the shoving and mincing into a bloody pulp implied in the game might be too far but they could have tried to circumvent it in a way similar to that of the ""Freddy eats a chicks upper half of the body scene"" which was just kinda silly and plays into my next complaint which is that the way the animatronics act sometimes feels like they are discarding the way animatronics are supposed to be possessed and not actual ghosts like in the games, the whole showing kids instead of the animatronics thing really made somethings feel less impactful since they essentially humanized the animatronics really early into the movie which makes them less threatening as a result and makes the movie fall into the creepy kids cliche. There were also things like foxy teleporting to kill someone which was really weird and probably would have been more scary if they made him run at the guy like in FNAF 2.The pacing also felt really off even though the actual plot is fine enough. There is a ton of time spent toward the beginning on very slow scenes that are more supposed to flesh out characters and start the plot which is fine but it feels like it keeps this momentum until the 2nd act ends. It is just slow and that would be fine but they really decided to put the pacing into hyper drive for the third act because it really goes by like road runner which would be fine if the movie was more fast paced before that but it isn't which gives a feeling that they should've given more time to flesh out the ending instead of having a slow pace for the entire movie and then the ending feeling underdeveloped.Overall I wanted to like the movie but there are just so many baffling decisions made that make it not good.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","banspdi","30 October 2023","Just finished watching Five Night's at Freddy's at home. The movie, CONCEPTUALLY was so good. Having played FNAF since it first came out in 2014, I was so excited to see the adaptation for the movie 9 years later. If you are like me, DO NOT get your hopes up.The movie plot had potential, but was boiled down to a cheesy thriller that had maybe four or five callbacks to the incredibly extensive lore that Scott Cawthon established over the years with the Five Night's at Freddy's game series. I believe the PG-13 rating suits it perfectly- very VERY little gore, no drugs, no drinking, etc. So, if you are watching for the story-line alone, I would say it's not a good watch for you unless you are a younger teenager looking for a fun thriller with a few scary scenes.The visuals, however, were INCREDIBLE. Truly, I could not imagine a better real-life interpretation of the animatronics. You can look up the animatronic pictures online and get a good feel of how amazing they are. Not sure I would recommend the movie for the visuals.Overall, Five Night's at Freddy's is an incredibly below average thriller film with phenomenal visuals. The plot barely scratches the surface of the lore behind the entire game series. Not worth the watch.","

It wasn't so much a horror film in the sense of blood and gore but that of a psychological thriller.The movie is loosely based on the video game of the same title. However, they do change a few things around such as the history of the game on how the dine-in pizza place came to be shut down. Some of the character roles are switched up and at the same time still played a major piece in the storyline. There is a lot of lore sprinkled throughout the movie as well as Easter Eggs to keep you on your toes.Now for those that know nothing about the franchise of this game, you're fine. Honestly around my fourth or fifth watch I asked myself if I would understand this film if I knew nothing about the game. Yes, yes I would. If anything, knowing nothing about the game will make it that much more exciting.This horror film had little dashes of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Scream"". Maybe ""SAW"" for one or two scenes, minus the blood. You can even think of the ""Shining"" for other things. All in all I would recommend watching this film if given the chance.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","marialiiva","28 October 2023","(Coming from a huge fan of the games) FNAF is a horror game with a very disturbing backstory. The pixelated moment with springtrap in game was a lot scarier than the live action scene, how is that even possible? It felt like a kids movie. Very very disappointing as I have been waiting for a FNAF movie for sooo many years now. After the movie ended, everyone at the cinema just left quietly with no applause, screams of excitement or even a happy face even tho there were a lot of fans. They just made a cliche horror movie with the animatronics: little kid drawing, talking to imaginary friends and nobody believes her etc. The movie was about some family drama not about surviving the night. The security guard was pretty much in no danger and he was sleeping all the nights and dreaming about the kids. There were not even any doors that he would have had to close if they get too close. It was literally a night guard duty job with nothing happening other than bad dreams... Later on he brought his sister there as there was literally no threat there and she wanted to go. There was even a scene where the animatronics were building a chair fort together and being best friends... I had no idea FNAF could be so unscary even tho the animatronics were very well done. In the very end they became dangerous to them but you really couldnt care less if anyone died and the animatronics just werent even a bit scary anymore. They also tried to put some lame jokes around for no reason. Knowing how disturbing, scary and unique the original games are im just wondering why they decided to make it a cliche ""horror"" movie that has been done a million times already. Nothing made sense. They could have made such an awesome movie with the concept of the games like having the guard trying to piece together whats happening, checking the cameras, having to save power and actually surviving... They could have had some scary flashbacks as he is figuring out what happened and showing the horror that the kids witnessed and went through and getting more insane knowing he might suffer the same fate. Could have been such a terrifying horror movie perfect for halloween and for fans but nah... I am extremely sad to leave such a review but its just the truth.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","todd-dai","27 October 2023","FNaF is a goofy parody of Chuck E. Cheese which took campy horror themes and made a fun and scary game. This movie shifts the tone to a serious family drama, which removed pretty much all fun and comedy from the story. Small jokes are made tongue-in-cheek and we laugh at some common painful experiences we've all had, but overall, it missed the vibe of the game. Another version did a better job of referring to the game and its elements while translating the campy element of the game into campy movie elements. It may have been simpler, but it was closer to the games.. Honestly this movie was more like Doctor Sleep. I'll probably rewatch the Willie's Wonderland movie to get the taste of this one out of my mind.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","ethantoy","27 October 2023","I don't have a lot to say other than that I haven't seen a video game adaptation this bad since Paul W. S Anderson's Resident Evil series. I don't really want to fill this entire review bubble up but I would HIGHLY suggest avoiding the theater for this one, it's a mess and a big one at that. It has way too many plot holes and pacing problems that it's unbearable to sit through- the acting from Hutcherson and Lillard is good, but I cannot say the same for the rest of the cast whatsoever.Incredibly underwhelming and worst of all: not scary, whatsoever. This film's tone was back and fourth and I couldn't believe what I was watching for nearly forty minutes.As far as adaptations go, it's bad, and I mean really bad. It's own story felt completely rewritten by Hollywood executives and not Scott himself, and it's just disappointing to such an extent that it's hard to imagine Scott even had a hand in any of this whatsoever because I couldn't imagine him being ok with the final results.Of course there's the PG-13 issue but this is something I somewhat anticipated (the games were never hyper violent nor gory, just dark material as far as storyline goes) but it's held back so much by dropping the violence in favor of weak jumpscares- it's disappointing to say the least.I dunno guys, I couldn't recommend spending nearly $12 to go and see this in the theaters- luckily we caught this on Peacock but it's really not worth admission for what you're expecting. Is it cool seeing the animatronics? Absolutely. Is it frightening and dark like the games were? Nope. Is the story just like the games? Nope.Look, take it as you will but it's just not worth your money. It's disappointing and I think the best part out of it all was Corey and that's all I could gather from it.","

Can't writers come up with something new, ever? It's like there's not even a need for writers anymore because they all tell the same story in one way or another. It's incredibly monotonous having to watch the same thing being told over and over. I guess they say around and said what can we take from every movie ever and throw it together in a poor fashion. I gave it 3 stars for the cinematography and the special effects. Don't waste your time, you've seen this before.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","wiktoriakoczaj","28 October 2023","Seeing the critics reviews got me worried, but don't listen to them! This is a movie for the fans and for those who want to have a good time. Not only is this about Freddy's but it has a storyline that attaches itself and makes sence into why the MC needs the job.Some Easter eggs thrown in there that were fun to spot
You can definitely watch this without knowing the lore or being a huge fan as it explains itself
There were moments where it was slightly scary in the sence you were on edge but this isn't very gory horror, ofcourse there were scenes but this isn't a saw like gore movie so don't expect to see full on gore.However there were some scenes which did get me I'll admit.There was no way to capture the scare of the games as horror games are more scary than films in my opinion and the games are first person so it's not like you're there playing it ,but it's definitely an enjoyable movie based around the first game and I'd recommend a watch!(Stick around after the credits)","

The writing felt lazy, the characters were just fine, there wasn't a whole lot of tension. The whole thing just felt fine, which is weird to me because the cast was great and the animatronic suits were really impressive. The sound design was kinda bad in my opinion, but something that I actually really liked was the lighting. The scenes felt super empty and lifeless, like the places around them weren't real, and even in scenes with extras it felt dull. The movie just fell flat. I'm genuinely happy that so many people enjoyed it, but I feel like you can make a movie that's a love letter to a series and still a good movie on its own.","

But the Director just Couldn't Pull it all together Effectively.And then you have other problems with the film -1. 👎 The Lead Actors Performance is just not good enough to lead a film.2. 😶 (is this Horror at the level of Tweens and 13 & 14 year olds?) There were a couple of half decent Horror moments, but then it just Dissipates into thin air.🙇🤷3. 🐻 The Plotline, I liked the Plotline, but again it's a very ehh execution, it's ehh leaning into a dull execution.4.🐰When the Rabbit takes the mask off, whatever interest I had left in this film(which was already evaporating by the Minute) was completely extinguished after that.5. 🎬 The Director just Couldn't make the right choices and get this thing Firing on All Cylinders.Overall, Five nights at Freddy's starts off with interest and then it's just an egg timer ⏳ of losing all interest and losing whatever Horror Element the film had in the First Place.","

This movie is downright dumb. I have zero knowledge of the video game, but I had a hard time following the plot.Mainly because it's a very, very, very boring movie. The entire first half has no action. Then when the action clicks in, it's disappointing.The writing is really poor and the direction worse. I can't say much about the acting because the actors don't have much to work with.Frankly, I was shocked at how much this looked like Willy's Wonderland! Only no where near as good.","

As a stand-alone movie it's just plain bad and as a fan of the games I'm severely disappointed and disgusted with Scott's desire to ruin his own franchise with references to anything but the matpat m-preg story he wrote. If you think the story went down hill after pizzeria simulator you won't like this movie. Some people say this movie is for the fans but my friend and I were so beyond upset after leaving the theater because if this is what fans like I severely worry about their judgement in other parts of life if they can rave over a lack of story, 8 plots that go nowhere and a complete betrayal to everything the first games were.","

I really wanted more footage of the security guard ""surviving"". He spent like three nights there...dreaming about his brother. I wanted Freddy to show up at the door with the theme song and him like freak out like everyone did when they would play a fnaf game. I understand the directors needing to place the base layer of info for people who haven't played the game, but it was incredibly slow. Also, there was maybe 1 halfway decent jumpscare! I think every fan wanted a handful of scares just like the games. One thing I did like was the animatronics. They seemed to behave properly like the game, but that was 1 pro and way too many cons. I hope when and if they try to make a sequel, they will change it drastically.","

The writing is poor, the acting is mediocre, and it is not scary at all. It seems like the only positive reviews are coming from prior fans of the game series who hold a bias, but for the average viewer who's just wanting to watch a good film this is a fail. The pacing in the movie is very jarring, and there is also far too much dialogue and not enough action. The plot is a convoluted mess and the final showdown was a huge let down. The run time of the film is rather long yet it still wasn't able to make any sense of the story. Completely forgettable and generic.","

It actually reminds me of a bad part 2 of The Banana Splits comedy horror movie and that was bad. Freddy's is worse than that!. They could have made it so much better and should have. PG13 says it all really. They should have bumped it to 15 or 18 and actually showed the horror instead of cutting off any potential horror. I just do not see the point in having somebody get killed but not get killed but they are killed. What I mean is, person about to get killed then scene changes to something completely different and of course, they are dead but no death shown. Make it a 15 or 18 and have it like saw. Show it all. What a big let down. I would say watch Banana splits, it is bad but it is better than this rubbish.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Ratpires","28 October 2023","The only ""good"" part were the end credits. And it's because of the living tombstone's song.If that doesn't tell you about the quality of this movie, I don't know what will.My review has to have 500 more characters to post, so I'll just go ahead and break it down for you I guess. In the least spoiler-y way possible.Whoever made this movie has no idea how to make a horror movie. Who is your audience? Children? Adults? It's not at all clear who this was aimed for and that's probably the biggest reason it fell flat.Had it been a gory horror movie, maybe it would've been better. But since there are several scenes in the movie where it seems to be pandering to little kids, it feels like the whole movie is a big identity crisis.Also the writing just sucks.Allow me to clarify (I edited this in since I had some time to think about it later and talk to other people about it). A major character died. No funeral, no police investigation. The body wasn't hidden it was in a house, the MAIN CHARACTER'S house. Yet? No mention of it after? Just nothing, like it never happened.On top of that, a major plot point is about the main character's brother. We find out who did it, but it was NEVER elaborated on. WHAT happened to him. WHY did it happen. WHERE is his body. Just nothing at all. It's like the writers forgot that was the literal main plot of their story. (It would have made much more sense to make the brother like... one of the animatronics... no idea why they didn't just do that. EASY solution to all of those questions.)Then there's a scene where the cop is asking the main character about why he didn't lock a door. Instead of him saying ""I did lock the door"" or ""I'm sorry I forgot to lock the door"" he instead replies ""YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND"". Wha? Huh? Then he walks the cop to a little creek, sits down, and goes on a giant boring exposition about his brother. HOW is this related to locking a door.You wasted 10+ minutes of screen time retelling something we were shown at least 5 times by then, but had no clear response to the question he had been asked. So when you look at the WHOLE situation, the conversation went like this:""why didn't you lock the door"" ""you don't understand, my brother is dead and here's how that happened"". DID YOU LOCK THE DOOR OR DID YOU NOT? THIS ANSWERS NOTHING.On top of all of this, no police investigation into the missing victims that are shown on screen dying. No mention of them after. Everything just resumes as normal.WHY did Afton want the main character to work at the pizza place as a night guard after finding out he was the brother of the kid? WHY didn't the girl straight up tell the main character about her dad and instead ""hinted at it"". WHY did she have to hint. It's not like he was watching her. Nobody was. She could have just straight up said it.By the way, she was supposed to be on duty, yet she stayed there the whole night with the main character. What about the rest of her route? Makes NO sense. How did she explain it to her coworkers when she was MIA for so long.WHEN THE TAPE MESSES UP, WHY DID THE MAIN CHARACTER HIT THE TV? INSTEAD OF THE VHS PLAYER? Hitting the TV will do nothing to effect the tape messing up, come on guys.WHY didn't the animatronics whip around quickly, like they did in the games? Why were they so slow the entire movie? All of the jump scares fell so flat because everything was too well lit and the animatronics moved too slow. Whats the point of a flashlight when everything's so well lit nobody even bothers to turn on a light to see.Why are they scared of the Balloon Boy doll? You have to have CONTEXT for him to be scary. My mom, who barely knows about the FNAF series, watched the movie on her own and was completely baffled by why there were jump scares with the doll. It just. Looks like a doll. You have to know WHY it's scary for it to BE scary.It's just not a movie made for anyone. Too bloody to be for kids, too boring for teens, too kiddish for adults. There are so many things in this movie that DON'T MAKE SENSE.They don't even do a good job convincing you that he's poor, because there are government programs for people who need help with child care. Yet he is never shown reaching out about it and decides to just take his sister to work with him.He also acts like the animatronics being alive is. Normal. He isnt freaking out about it. No reaction just. Huh? Oh. This is normal.How did he know the kids were the ones from his dreams. Why did he just decide they were ghosts in his dream instead of just a dream. He looks at them and is just ""OH! You're the missing kids!"". What?So people that are mad about people rating this movie poorly, understand that you can enjoy things and they can be fun, but that doesn't mean they can't be critiqued by people who expected the movie, that was inspired by a game, to be more like the game.I wish I could give it a higher score for the puppets and for Matthew being in the movie, but there were no many negatives that it cancels out the positives.That's my honest review. I'm not a ""hater"" I'm not someone who never played the games. I'm a person who likes horror and likes good horror media, and this was not that.Thanks for reading.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","arungeorge13","27 October 2023","Hmm, so this DIDN'T turn out to be the Halloween gift I was anticipating. I've played the first FNAF game on my PC back in 2014, and the only thing the film gets right are the animatronic designs. I can picture the director's passion in wanting to stay true to the game's lore, but as a horror film, Emma Tammi utterly fails to deliver the goods. The film sets up a backstory for its protagonist played by Josh Hutcherson, but the pizzeria and its fascinating inhabitants barely get anything substantial.The tone is all over the place, and the film just doesn't let anything circumstantially funny be treated as funny. I think the makers went down the wrong path when they decided NOT to make this into a horror-comedy, which it well and truly could've been. The animatronics don't startle at all, and even for someone who hasn't played any of the videogames, this will come across as tame and lacking in thrills.Hutcherson puts up an okay show, but I absolutely did not enjoy Elizabeth Lail's performance (or characterization). You could literally call her ""Exposition Dump"" and it'd make no difference. Matthew Lillard is sort of there too, but what's even the point? I'm guessing the PG-13 rating is in line with what the original games wanted to offer: less gore, more atmospheric. Here, they achieve neither. And that's certainly a knock on the game's creator Scott Cawthon, who's part of the writing team here. There are too many scenes where violence is implied, but never shown. Ugh, bummer!","

With that out of the way, let's see what this movie was and was it worth the hype?Eh. I like horror movies and this sort of captured that horror feeling but not a lot. Matthew Lillard was somewhat okay but I was underwhelmed by his performance considering I was excited to see him in this movie. The CGI is good, I can't say it's perfect but it is practically a replica of the characters in the games from what I've seen. I know I've mentioned Lillard's performance so I won't glance over that again but what I will say is the acting in this movie is below average, mostly because the bad actors get more screen time, like the security guard (you may think he's good but I don't) and the child actors who try and I'll give them props for that but like most child actors are mediocre at best. I like the plot but the execution lets it down via the acting. I reckon if it wasn't as hyped as it was, Five Nights at Freddy's would be an okay movie, nothing special about it, but considering the popularity of FNAF and the hype this movie got, I was disappointed with the movie and I think I shouldn't play the games if they were a carbon copy of the movie.

The audience is left waiting for something interesting to happen, but unfortunately, that moment never comes.The characters are underdeveloped and uninteresting, making it difficult to feel any sense of connection or sympathy for their plight. The performances are wooden and lack any real depth, further adding to the movie's overall lack of appeal.The special effects and animatronics, which should have been the movie's saving grace, are surprisingly subpar. The animatronics lack the creepiness and realism that made the video game so frightening, instead coming off as cheap and unconvincing.Moreover, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the video game franchise so popular in the first place. The suspenseful gameplay, the eerie atmosphere, and the intricate backstory are all lost in translation, leaving fans of the franchise disappointed and frustrated.In conclusion, the ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" movie is a massive letdown.

Still I went into it with hope, and when I saw news of the first to watch it hating it I excused it, many people aren't fans of the games so maybe they just didn't know enough about them to thoroughly enjoy it as I hopped I would. Went in exsited, found myself wishing the movie would just end not even half way through, a major disappointment, the film had no atmosphere, the gore was non existent, the horror franchise I grew up on was adapted into a movie I would more describe a comedy, no scares what so ever, I predicted every single twist and reveal, I even predicted the lines the characters would say before they even said it. I grew up imagining getting springlocked as a horrific brutal and gory endeavour only to find it so tame and bland i nearly walked out of the theatre, the actors did a fine job but nothing outstanding, I wish Matthew lilard went full stu maucher with the ""I always come back"" line. I found the story to be the most boring strung together peice of work, to the point I was thinking of ways I would have changed the movie to make it better and found not one element of this ""movie"" to make the cut, so disappointed im genuinely sad as I hoped this would be a fantastic film full of fun jumpscares and gore, only to stumble upon the worst film of the year, possibly even the worst film I've seen that's come out since I was born, not to be dramatic, I was just so let down. I do really hope the fnaf franchise gets another movie that hopefully does it right, as the kids raised on the movie have grown up, they want to see a horror film for them now, not as a gateway horror for the younger kids who may have not even been born when the games came out. We want wall to wall jump scares, brutal gore, scary ambiance, and swearing, no one says ""what the heck"", at least no one respectable. As a huge fan of the franchise I really hope for another movie that may do it better, to mr. Blum ik it may be way more exspensive to do it the way fans want it, but it will pay off in the long run.","

The cast is pretty good you have, Boy from the hunger games, mr.crazy killer from scream, and the love interest from the first season of you. The story was simple yet it wasn't boring, it never lost my attention. The animatronics were awesome. The movie felt as if you were playing the game but obviously you weren't. Obviously the movie isn't canon but it takes the elements from the game and uses them in a way where it almost explains the whole lore, well if it was simplified. A person that has never played the game can have a very simple and easy understanding of what is happening.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","superfox_888","28 November 2023","I know zero about the source material, so I can't say whether this is true or not.This film doesn't seem to know which audience it belongs to. It's too scary for children, too tame for people over twelve. (Here in Australia, it is rated for people over 15.) It also seems like two separate stories which don't quite mesh at the end but leave it open to possible sequels, which is what most films do these days to rake in the dollars for franchises. The story isn't fully fleshed out, leading to an unsatisfying ending.Josh Hutcherson does his best here, but is let down by a poor supporting cast with the exception of the actress who plays his sister Abby, and Matthew Lillard, who is great in everything he does.I suppose this film is good for a slumber party of tweens defying their parents. If you're outside this age group, you probably won't enjoy it.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","justahunch-70549","29 October 2023","But there are few films that aren't. It's nearly as bad as it sounded, but I try to not pay to see garbage, though I certainly have unwittingly done so, but this was available on Peacock. This made a small fortune in theaters even while streaming, so I thought a look might be deserved. Wrong! It isn't scary at any moment, though I wouldn't advise it for small children. It has quite a few jump shots that just don't work and it is silly, not funny, beyond words. It's not cheap looking and it has a decent lead in Josh Hutcherson, a good actor who hasn't been able to really find much success since The Hunger Games. He's very game here taking this very seriously, though he looked weary near the end. Horrible is not strong enough word for the lead female character. The writing for this role made me cringe and the performance by Elizabeth Lail didn't help. The little girl was okay. The ending is a complete bore and it's set up for a sequel. Hutcherson has gotten his big hit, but I cannot help but wonder if he expected or wanted it to be this?!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","leighhawk-00060","27 October 2023","I want to preface this review by saying that I am someone who came into this solely to watch the movie. I never played the game and know very little about the characters/storyline.I came into it with a very basic understanding - a man owning a pizzeria uses it as a guise to kidnap and murder children, and then somehow trapping their souls in the animatronics.Knowing what I knew, I was intrigued when I heard a movie about it would be coming out. I was interested in seeing how they would make that come to life.That being said, right off the bat, I was disappointed with how little gore/scares there were. The majority of ""violence"" happened off screen. This movie is classified as horror. Not a single moment made me jump or feel scared.The movie was both short but also felt like long stretches of nothing was happening.**SPOILERS** Now this might come from my lack of knowing about the lore, but my biggest gripe was Vanessa. So a cop knows her dad is going around murdering people? And she tried ""warning"" Mike by doing next to nothing. Again, maybe this might be better explained from fans of the story, but her whole character was just riddled with problems.I kinda wish this movie went into a little more depth. Everything felt very surface level. Nothing is really explained too well. I wish there more background/screen time on William.Overall, it was a somewhat enjoyable watch. It's definitely a movie you can't take too seriously. By the looks of the ending, it looks like they'll be another. Hopefully the next one will step up it's game.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Lythas_85","29 October 2023","As always, we have your typical dynamics that we see frequently in movies. When it is a male main character and a female one that has the answers.. she will refuse to give the guy the answeres that would make the guy's life much easier.. had blondie there just old him what was happening, Mike could have done something about it..
but of course, had the main character been a female and police officer a male, she would have gotten on his face and made him tell her the truth.The scene when mike wakes up and the police officer lady bandaged his arm.. so, the big toy cornered him at the locked door but he got away somehow? Ok, he asks her about the babysitter and the brother and she already knew they were gone.. she never told him anything about them being possessed.. dude, what kind of cop is this chick anyway.. it was the second time he asked her.. and she just babbled something and never answered...her explaining about the kids... we all know that if it were the other way around as in the male officer having kept everything from the woman and his father being the killer.. we know she would have sucker punched real good.. right?The dude from the job office being the bad guy.. it was obvious from the start since he was the only other character introduced besides the already dead ones..so in the end.. the animatronics were possessed or the kids were actually inside physically? I didnt understand and didnt make any sense.. all of this drama o mike not remembering.. only for it to be ignored.. his brother is gone and the soul.. who knows.. i thought there would be a twist .. maybe his brother was in one of the things.. but nah.. so this arc was just nonsense to make him look like he spent the night drinking.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jameswprice-43714","28 October 2023","I just don't understand the hate this movie is getting. It focuses on a dark story and a brother / sister relationship over the horror for sure but it is done extremely well to the point that we love both Abby and Mike by the halfway point which adds a ton of tension to the final act.I've seen many people saying the story is 'confusing' which unless you are half a brain cell short of being considered a mental invalid I have no idea how. I have not played any of the games and know nothing more than the basic premise and I still followed this film easily and had a great grasp on what was going on. The story was mysterious but that worked in it's favor more than anything.My only complaint is that the third act felt a little rushed and I definitely think we should've seen the villain a lot more.Awesome movie and one of the best of the year. 10/10 for me.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","lukachowoessner","1 November 2023","Either the original games' atmosphere and story were way worse than I remember them being, or this movie just did a really poor job replicating them. The animatronics themselves just aren't scary and constantly get demystified over the course of this movie, leaving only very few moments where there's actually a hint of horror left. The story, while not entirely uninteresting, still seems convoluted and only holds the movie back even more when it comes to actually being scary or creating a chilling atmosphere. This seems to me like a fine hommage to the original games, which you'll probably find some way to enjoy if you're already a fan of the series. For everyone else though, it's neither that interesting, nor scary. There aren't any interesting stylistic devices present and most moments are either completely forgettable or immediately obvious.Overall I'd give it a watch if you're somewhat interested in the franchise. It's not unwatchable, Just really generic.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","sethnoodles","12 November 2023","This movie has too much hate from critics. As a fan of FNAF since September of 2014, this is the best way they could've done the movie.Saying the FNAF lore is complicated would be an understatement. The FNAF lore is all over the place with many puzzles still left unanswered. This movie brings the main and most important parts of the lore and puts it in the movie, which can be complicated for people who never played the games.The animatronics and other visuals are FANTASTIC! Jim Henson's Creature Shop did such an incredible job at the animatronics. I was blown away when I first saw the trailers of how accurate they were to the games! And for those who complain Bonnie is blue in the movie, he always was. The red eyes were controversial but this movie isn't in the same universe as the games and the red eyes look alright.The scariness in the movie was what I was the most underwhelmed by. In the UK the movie is a 15 which was kind of a surprise to me, the goriness to me was more like A Quiet Place level of gore (A Quiet Place is a 12). I do not believe gore is required to scare people, for me goriness just grosses you out, not scare you. Scariness for me is tension and jumpscares. Jumpscares aren't really a thing in this movie besides one or two scenes. I wish there will be more of a horror factor in the sequel (which I believe is currently in pre production).Overall, this movie is over hated. It is made for the FANS, not the CRITICS. Go ahead and watch the movie!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","dante199888","1 November 2023","I can see why some people are disappointed at the movie, because this is VERY loosely based on the video game lore. Don't expect crucial parts of the lore to be any important in this movie, nor anything scary, this is more like if a casual non-fan were to make a FNAF based movie. However, the movie on itself isn't that interesting or cohesive. At some points it felt like a drama, then comedy, suspense, then an action horror but at an uneven pace. The new lore/story was an interesting take but it couldn't compensate for how messy and rushed the movie felt. I question why a studio like blumhouse kept the movie in production for a bunch of years, and being made ""top"" priority just for it to come up short stacked and lack lustered. There was big potential on how to handle this franchise as a movie series but I guess long time fans have to settle for less (corprate hollywood production). But hey, it's for the kids.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","masonsaul","1 November 2023","Five Nights at Freddy's has a very clear love for the source material however that isn't enough to make up for an adaptation that's light on scares and too heavy on lore. It's pretty funny and really weird but it's also almost entirely free of any terror or tension, constantly undermining itself and over-explaining everything to the point nothing makes sense.Possibly even more of a crime than any of that though, is the fact that it's just really boring, diverting almost all of its screen time to the wrong aspects. It's a serious contender for the least scary horror film of all time. Being gore free doesn't help either, it's hard to be scared of the animatronics when you can't actually see what they're doing to people.Josh Hutcherson ironically spends most of the film sleeping, his bored attitude does occasionally work in its favour until anything major happens, then he just feels too restrained. Matthew Lillard clearly understands the assignment and the only issue is he's not in the film anywhere near enough.Emma Tammi's direction has a fair few frustrating missed opportunities, even if the practical effects are cool. Early sequences use CCTV to establish themselves until they actually get to the Freddy's when that's suddenly dropped. A lack of jump scares is usually a good thing but considering the source material it's weird there's so few present.The score by the Newton Brothers is surprisingly good. It switches back and forth between being an effective 80s homage and just really eerie in a way that's actually more unsettling than the animatronics themselves, who make way too much noise any time they move and don't look creepy enough.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","paul-41003","28 October 2023","The original concept of this film began in 2015 4yrs before a global pandemic and it was under Warner bros...safe hands.They wash there hands of it and so many script changes and issues has cursed this beloved video game. The fact it finished filming in February 2023 and was released 8 months later says it all.The Animatronics do look good I will admit that, but who's stupid idea was it to go against the game and have they move on screen? The whole scare point of the game is they move but you never see them move you just see them in different camera shots.The evil aunt was a stupid addition five nights has a good backstory so why change it.Apart from the Animatronics I'm really struggling to think of a positive for this film.At 1hr 49mins long it's a painful watch, I just hope the sequal does it better.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10 November 2023","Five Nights at Freddy's is based on the cult classic video game series that spun off from a sleeper-hit indie-game that took the internet by storm when it came out. Now fast forward to 2023 and the long-gestating film finally got released: and it's as 'crowd pleasing' as a film based off its source material can be; too bad the jump scares here are been-there-done-that-cliches that only leave microseconds of impression on the brain of discernible horror film aficionados out there, only to be forgotten completely by the time the credits roll.The film's puppetry is easily the star of the show here; Jim Henson's Creature Shop did commendable work with the animatronics here, and it justifies the film's existence on that front. If only the script didn't have such a... barren scope and sense of depth to it. Five Nights at Freddy's wasn't gonna be a blockbuster kind of film exactly, but the story had every right to be deserving of a deeper screenplay: instead the film uses a barebones jump scare fest that is built on sequel-bait instead of telling a complete and worthwhile story.2023 seems to have given rise to the video game film in a way that's more consistent than the one-off-megahits like the Resident Evil films; The Super Mario Brothers Movie has opened the floodgates for the battered video game film, and the quality of said films are gonna be all over the place.Five Nights at Freddy's has great puppetry but the story can't match that aspect simply because there isn't enough to it. Maybe the next one will have a better script, but usually sequels have something to draw upon. I don't know what the draw is here.2/5 stars.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","robertscotthixon","1 November 2023","Overall, a lazy story focused on keeping the animatronics offscreen unless completely necessary, the saving grace is the animatronics when they appear.Maybe budget? Maybe trying to build a deeper story but I got so tired of the kidnapped brother storyline, I get how it's important but did not need to take up that much time with it. It felt like a cop-out for production not having enough money to have the characters in more scenes. The constant flashbacks to the same scene ruined it for me.That said, the animatronics were incredible, just scarce throughout the movie, and not in a ""keeping the scary stuff unseen"" way. I like the characters, but especially the cop's story fell apart at the end. She can't be good and not tell them what's going on.Overall, a lazy story focused on keeping the animatronics offscreen unless completely necessary, the saving grace is the animatronics when they appear.","

It about a security guard gets a job at now abandoned ""Chuck E. Cheese"" place. While learn about the place with local policewoman he discovered there something sinister about their animatronics.Okay movie, but nothing special. Not worthy of a Razzie award it more of future cult following/favorite.The problem with this film is the writing. It has slow pace, too many dream sequences and personal problems than a scary movie. It is creepy but made little to no sense (unless you read the book or play the video games).It not a bad movie, it an okay flick.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Zac_La_Porte","21 November 2023","What made the FNAF games so terrifying were the chilling atmospheres, extremely creepy sightings of the animatronics and the nail-biting sense of danger, which would end each round with an accomplishing win or a massive jump-scare. This atrociously bad family-horror movie just abandons those factors and introduces us to a bunch of characters and situations we don't care about. Josh Hutcherson plays a security guard haunted by a troubled past who begins working the night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a local family diner. However, he soon comes to realise that the restaurant holds dark secrets of its own.When you look at the production design and the look of the animatronic animals, you're witnessing such incredible potential that the film should've dedicated more of its focus to. Freddy Fazbear's is a dilapidated building with so much detail cast upon every wall, floor and stage in every area. Freddy, Foxie, Bonnie and Chica are these giant machines that are super menacing when they're standing still, but unfortunately, they always seem less threatening when we see them moving around in their robotic states.Running just a minute short of 110 minutes, it would've been reasonable to have 20-30 minutes of character development towards the start before thrusting our lead character into the position of the security guard, and dedicating the rest of the film to that. Unfortunately however, this movie just goes ballistic with the amount of character development and sub-themes. It ends up being a ""drama"" about a man's traumatic outlook on life, the abduction of a young child that took place decades ago, and a custody battle that's been tossed into the mix at the last minute; that's not what you should be saying about a new movie titled after and based off of the popular survival game series Five Nights at Freddy's.Excluding the atrocious amount of time used to set up the main character and the story that lap over the movie we came to see, Five Nights at Freddy's is also extremely boring, and it has a major lack of terror and tension. The horror of most horror movies often consist of way too many jump-scares, but of course in the adaptation of a game that has a major focus on jump-scares delivered by the animatronics, there's only a few jump-scares in this movie, which will leave so many hard-core fans in immense disappointment. It's also worth noting that games weren't focused on extreme violence or gore; it was always the high levels of terror that made them so effective. But without any real suspense, it would've made sense to just throw in a fun gore-fest.Perhaps one of the film's most annoying inclusions however, was something you knew would take place due to the trailers and marketing, is the fact that Josh Hutcherson's character is also responsible for taking care of his child-aged sister. This is something that should've been limited to the story taking place outside of Freddy Fazbear's, and you'd expect the kid to only have real value in that other plot. Unfortunately, the screenwriters have decided that this wide-eyed, fearless and creepy little girl who listens to no grown ups would be the source of bait for the animatronic animals. In many scenes, Josh Hutcherson and Elizabeth Lail will be having a conversation that's suddenly interrupted by this girl screaming like she's being attacked, to which they run out to save her, and it turns out that the animatronics are just being a little ticklish and goofy. These animatronics look awesome, the film is directed nicely, and there's plenty of references and details that fans will enjoy picking up on. But looking past all of that, all that's left is horror clichés, missed opportunities and the fact that they made another piece of garbage out of a game we love.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","bhernandez2216","28 October 2023","So I finally get to see Five Nights at Freddy's movie, and it was pretty entertaining and it was also fun, when it comes to video games you've grown to love as a true fan of many genres you like to reconsider playing, and then make a pretty good fun film based on video games, but only if you have to tell a really good story.Don't get me wrong, there are some video game movies that are good and some are bad with terrible story or writings, but sometimes you just gotta live with it, most of the time.Josh Hutcherson did a really good job with his performance, and Matthew Lillard tho, he's the right guy, and the right man for the job to steal the whole show with his powerful acting skills.First he was Stu Marcer from Scream and then Shaggy from Scooby-Doo movies, but now for FNAF, I think you'll definitely enjoy this movie when you come to realize that it's a pretty good video game movie when you get around with many video game genres.But either, I had a lot of fun, and I say this movie deserves a sequel, no matter how long it takes, but Five Nights at Freddy's movie needs another sequel, because Blumhouse and Scott Cawthon did a pretty good job with there creative skills of horror and scares, and all the fun you'll have at the movies!8/10.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jmbovan-47-160173","29 October 2023","After several movies that have taken animatronic animals to the creepy extreme, I was excited by Five Nights at Freddy's screening as a movie. I don't play video games, but based upon The Banana Splits and Willy's Wonderland movies, I had high hopes for this film seeing as these other films had ideas similar to this or based upon some idea of this video game.And Freddy's is just sort of there. Acting is good. Story is good. Production is decent. Nice ideas and decent expansion for character development.But overall, Freddy's just meanders through the story without much in terms of tension or suspense. They tie the story lines together nicely, although these were obvious. And it just resolves itself. Elements are taken out of the action, and viola, no more issue. Nothing seems to have much weight, and the solutions are pretty simple.I ""liked"" it overall but with much criticism. Not bad but not something that I want to watch again or need a sequel. Josh Hutcherson does an excellent acting job though pulling away from his typical type of role.(Ultimately, I'd like a sequel to Willy's Wonderland and more of that gonzo Nicolas Cage character.)","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","cardsrock","2 November 2023","Given Blumhouse's success with M3GAN earlier this year, I assumed they would strike a similar tone with this animatronic horror film. It's kind of crazy how rapidly this film will shift from depressing child murder drama to a happy-go-lucky fever dream. It doesn't strike that in-on-the-joke tone that M3GAN excelled at. While I think there should be some darker horror elements, far too infrequently does the film revel in the goofy camp of its premise. The dead kid stuff is just not very original and not very well executed. Add in being incredibly predictable with paper thin characters too.This film also drags on far too long. You could easily cut 25 minutes and nothing would change. The story beats get hammered over and over with some honestly poor resolution. Five Nights at Freddy's is a big miss from a reasonably reliable studio.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jace_the_film_guy","2 November 2023","To follow the core story of ""Five Nights at Freddy's"", you do not need to have played the game. I have never picked up a copy of ""FNAF"" and went into the movie somewhat blind, only knowing bits and pieces of the lore. As events unfolded, there was never a moment when the main plot felt confusing. As a mildly creepy, jump-scare filled thriller, the film delivered.The main character, Mike, has a strong backstory with clear motives and reasoning. His character has a strong focus on a concept called ""Dream Theory"", which is fascinating. The performance by Josh Hutcherson is admirable and I truly cared about what happened to him and his sister.Apart from big blockbuster superhero films, I have never seen a crowd so excited and invested in a movie. On more than one occasion, the majority of the crowd went berserk with enthusiastic applause, and I had no clue the reason. While the story was simple to follow, the deeper pieces of ""FNAF"" lore left a portion of the audience on the outside of an inside joke.Rather than keep the film a tight 90 minutes, there is about 20 minutes of fluff that unnecessarily dragged on. The side-plot of the movie was dull and half-baked, with some of the characters falling into stereotypes. Similarly, though Mike's backstory is interesting, the end of his narrative lacks closure.As the end credits rolled, I leaned over to talk to some of the patrons who cheered the loudest during the ""inside joke"" moments. The two audience members had this to say: ""It was a cinematic masterpiece. We know everything about ""FNAF"", having played all the games, and it stayed true to about 75% of the source material.""If you are familiar with ""Five Nights at Freddy's"", this film will not disappoint. However, as someone with minimal exposure to the source material, the result was a bit lackluster.Best Character - Mike

"Five Nights at Freddy's","dhpgfbkfm","28 October 2023","First of all, it was okay. It is watchable. But as a fan, I am honestly disappointed. I grew up on the games and my childhood is based on fnaf. Honestly, I know the film is based on the books, and yes I didn't read them. I know that Scott said the books are canon as well as the games, but the fanbase grew up on THE GAMES NOT THE BOOKS. I just don't get why they didn't made the film based on the lore of the games, I am sure if they had done it, every fan would have enjoyed the film.Basically this film is about Mike whose little brother was kidnapped and he couldn't get over it. He lives with his young sister who can speak with ghosts. He gets the security job and meets Vanessa. Vanessa is strange but kind. A babysitter was looking after Abby, while Mike is at work. Mike had a fight before and his aunt wants to take Abby from her because she finds him irresponsible. So the anomatronics want Abby to become like them, and Mike wants to know who killed his brother. The ghost children told Mike they will give him his brother but he has to do anything they want. Mike said yes but after he regretted it and the anomatronics got mad. Soon William appeared in spring bonnie custome, and Abby showed the anomatronics that he is their killer. Also before it, Vanessa tells Mike that his father, William Afton is the killer. William stabs her. So after Abby shows the anomatronics the truth, they got mad and the springlock failure happens. At the end, Vanessa is in the hospital.All in all, this movie was disappointing for a fan, I would recommend this, just because the actors were great and the anomatronics were cool. But the plot wasn't as great as I wished)):","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jjgonzalez-06426","27 October 2023","Controversial review. Very controversial review. But I loved it. I mean, loved it. First off the story/plot of the game on the big screen was amazing. Some of the kills were great (even though censored heavily but I mean hey, kids in the audience). As a FNAF veteran (Since the month the game CAME OUT); I enjoyed every minute of this, even though it may seem like ""typica horror schlock"" to the general audience. My only gripe was that COME ON BLUMHOUSE, you underused MATTHEW LILLARD??? That and some flaws in writing were the only issues I have but honestly, as a ""bad movie lover"", I bypassed them. Just so happy to see the animatronics going beyond the games, and also how perfect they look. The bro-sis chemistry between Josh and Piper was also great. Gonna enjoy this again VERY soon. Definitely BlumHouse's safest play for wanting kids to go see it. Concerning the general audience, I can understand not liking it for its flaws, but fans are definitely gonna love it. I loved it.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","okpilak","30 October 2023","It started out strong. A good cast and the animatronics were done very well. Mike is clearly down in the dumps. Cannot keep a job, has his sister Abby whom he loves, but his aunt is seeking custody so he desperately needs a good job. He is haunted by seeing his brother Garrett kidnapped from a park outing when he was 12 and relives the scenes through dreams every night. He is offered a job. The pay is not great, and the hours are worse. It is a night security guard at a closed pizza play place. It was abandoned after some children seemingly disappeared from there. Mike plays the role of a down and out person very well. But having to chose between losing Abby and taking the job, he takes the job. All he has to do is stay awake at night and make sure no one breaks in. But things do go bump in the night. One night, Vanessa, a police officer, stops by as the place is on her beat. She tells him some of the history of the place, and shows the animatronics. A couple of days later, Abby's babysitter works with three others to break in and wreck the place, so Mike will lose his job, and the aunt will get Abby. That didn't turn out well. From here on, it starts to get excessively complex and in some ways confusing. This detracts from the movie that didn't need to happen.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","shoebsaad","1 November 2023","""Five Nights at Freddy's"" is a movie adaptation that disappoints in comparison to the gripping video game series it's based on. While the animatronics and the core premise remain intriguing, the film's lack of character development, disjointed storytelling, and inconsistent horror elements hinder its potential. Fans of the games might appreciate seeing the characters on the big screen, but the film fails to fully capture the essence of what made the franchise so captivating. It's a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the lore and fear-inducing elements of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. While it's not without its merits, ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" falls short of its potential and earns a modest 5/10 🌟","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","nebula0024","27 October 2023","All-in-all, the film was kinda mid, and it was largely due to the script.The character of Mike is probably the most thought-out person in the film. Mike is deeply flawed, likely depressed, stressed, and with past trauma, which would explain why he has such a hard time keeping a job. Because of this, he cannot see the solution right in front of him, which is to sell the house.The notice of delinquency, which obviously doesn't refer to child support since Abby (his sister) is with him, is likely from the IRS or Mortgage company.Selling the house and moving would allow him to pay off his debts, give him a fresh start, and move somewhere else with more work to suit his talents. It would also allow him to get away from the toxic and narcissistic Aunt Jane. However, because of the aforementioned reasons, the obvious solution eludes him (plus the movie needs to happen, so...)The rest of it kind of falls apart, though...VCR static/damage/bad tracking seemed to have been created by someone who has never personally experienced those things. When a VCR tape is damaged or loses tracking, the whole image moves. The filter they applied (I'm guessing it was either Motion Array or Maxon Universe plugins for AE) was just applied on top, with a bit of image bleed. The entire image needed to jerk around, too. The tape was also too high resolution, and was clearly a progressive image when it should have been interlaced.The officer, Vanessa, says Mike's eyes are bloodshot, but they're clearly not.The people who broke in, what they did made absolutely no sense. They broke in after Mike had finished his shift, and after they saw him leave at the same time as the cop. So even if they claimed the break-in happened during Mike's shift, she could back him up that everything was fine up until he finished his shift.Other complaints I would just chalk up to weak writing taking the easy way to get to new scenes, or pushing the film in a certain direction...Why was Vanessa giving him a hard time about the pills? Why is he acting so shady about them? They're clearly prescription. It isn't a crime.She shouldn't even be implying he ""left a door unlocked"", or that he was ""wacked out"". She had no idea if he was even using it at work. For all she knew, it could have fallen out of his pocket or bag.Vanessa, in her own words, claims she can't wrap her head around why Mike would bring Abby (little sister) with him to work. She should already know why. Even though it's revealed a little later he has a secondary reason (the abduction mystery), what isn't a mystery is that he's Abby's legal guardian and he's struggling. A police officer in particular should understand parents (in this case, legal guardian), would need to bring their kid to work with them.Vanessa tells Mike to go home in the middle of his shift and seems to blame him for Abby getting electricuted, even though she herself witnessed sparks flying from the animatronic in question. She also knew exactly how dangerous they were from the beginning. She herself is equally to blame if blame needs to be laid.Vanessa is angry Mike brought Abby to Freddy's even though she herself encouraged Abby to stay there by helping build the fort. She's a hypocrite.The Pharmacist steps out of line by questioning a medication prescribed by a doctor to Mike. He looks at the prescription, and with a disapproving face says ""you know what works for me?""... He even calls Mike a dirty name when Mike is having none of it and leaves, when it was really the Pharmacist's own fault. That was probably just a bit more awkward than anything else, since bad pharmacists surely exist.This could have been a great movie but the script needed some more time in the oven.","

The most horrifying part of the movie is when the main character gets scared by a balloon boy figure. Everything else was very peaceful. Very disappointed because what is promised a a horror movie ends up being something like the movie: Let's play with the animatronics and make a tent together. There were some parts of the movie that should be cut because they are very boring and existential problems. It should be mentioned that I seem to be missing something at the end, as if they worked better at the end than on the existential problems of the characters. It seemed to me that there was a strong emotional bond between Mike and Vanessa and I would have liked to see them at least kiss. In the end, instead, Vanessa ends up in the hospital bed and is in a coma and Mike comes to visit her. I feel it seems like the ending is a bit left up in the air......","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","tilogongoll","27 October 2023","This is the first time I am actually writing a bad review for a movie. I don't usually do this since I respect the effort required by so many individuals to create a feature film. But for this movie, I felt cheated on - I spent 13 euros on sitting through the most boring and soulless piece of media in existence.I went into the movie with a friend of mine and we both expected a fun time. We both weren't new to the franchise and had fun playing the games as kids so I assumed that it we were part of the target audience. And I was so wrong.The plot is centered around a guy whose brother was kidnapped when he was younger. This tragic event led to him trying to find the kidnapper by attempting to recreate the scenery in his sleep. This attempt, however, leads to him spacing out often, being emotionally unstable and, thus, not being able to keep a job.At the same time, there is the conflict about him being responsible for his sister since his parents passed away. His aunt tries to gain custody of his sister as a result of his financial and emotional instability. Since the guy does not want his sister to be taken away from him, he accepts a job at Freddy Fazbears Pizzeria.While this plot is not that horrible, it is executed so poorly that I could not take any of it seriously after approximately 30 minutes. None of the characters' motivations are plausible: why would the main character who is in his mid twenties, struggles with his finances, has deep psychological problems and shows no sign of willingness to interact with his sister sacrifice everything to retain custody? Why would his aunt who also has no identifiable grudge against the main character and has no connection to her niece try to destroy his life in such an undiplomatic manner (for instance, she initiates a robbery of the pizzeria to make him loose his job, which is entirely unnecessary in the context of his already existing issues). There are NO likable characters in this movie which is completely insane. The ones that are (or at least seem to be) written to be likable are insufferable in most of the dialogues. The movie probably would have been better if the lines were cut by 50%.While the movie failed to deliver a good plot, it was still true to the lore of the games. The integration of the lore, however, felt akward and forced. Some characters even outright stated some lore knowledge which totally misses the point of why the underlying plot of the games worked so well: the beauty of the storytelling in the games laid in its subtility. If you didn't want to know anything about the story, you were not bombarded with lore.The fixation on the lore was made obvious through the appearance of matpat, a known overanalizer of small details regarding the Fnaf games. While the appearance was cute and I smiled when he showed up, it was ultimately pointless and it felt like this cameo (and the implementation of that's just a theory) did not fit into a universe that wants to take itself so serious.The acting severely suffered under the poor writing, that is all I can say about that. It is pretty hard to appreciate the acting of someone that plays the most poorly written and unlikable character that was exposed to the world in a long time.Then there is the horror aspect of the movie. Well, actually there isn't. I understand that it was meant to be appealing to a larger audience but scares were basically non-existent. All the animatronics that seemed so frightening in the games were more of a laughingstock and the atmosphere of the haunted diner was destroyed almost as soon as the main cast of the animatronics appeared.I didn't expect it to be a bloody gorefest (most of the horror in the games was already really stomachable in my opinion) but I still was severely disappointed by the lack of anything remotely scary.While I almost exclusively found the movie astoundingly horrible, most of the times, the lighting, shots, music and general setting were always good and beautiful at times. This does slightly bump the rating but to be honest, the technicalities were not enough to cover up the horrific writing - If you dress a turd up nicely, it will still smell bad.Ultimately, the movie seemed like it didn't know what to be. It certainly wasn't a horror movie, took itself to seriously to be a comedy and was to whacky and poorly written to be a drama.So who is the movie even made for? Apparently not for me, that is all I can say.If you can stomach bad writing, unlikable characters, plotholes and eat up everything that a franchise feeds you, you will be having a pretty good time. Especially because there is a lot to discover regarding Easter eggs. If you are not familiar with the franchise or have standards when it comes to the quality of the media you consume, don't even bother. It was so bad that you cannot even laugh at it.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","livinlikelarryrn","27 October 2023","After following the game for 10 years, I'm extremely disappointed how this came out. The story has basically 0 relation with the fnaf lore and tried to create NEW lore which isn't even true. (Vanessa being Williams daughter which is SO far from the actual truth it's painful) Sparky the dog had WAY too much effort put into it like for crying out loud it's not a real thing, the spring lock wasn't brutal enough as it should have been, who tf is Abby and why does the whole story revolves around her, why isn't there any doors mechanics, why is balloon boy in it MULTIPLE times (timeline doesn't make sense) because bb is in fnaf 2 which shows the original animatronics being withered and used for scrap parts so bb shouldn't even exist in this timeline, not to mention how the spring lock didn't happen til fnaf 3, in 2059. This entire movie was an entire joke. It's like the film directors just saw ""dead children in animatronics let's make our own twist"" like you can't do that. I waited a whole year for this mess of a movie. There was no scary parts, no jump scares, no true fnaf.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","purplerice000","29 October 2023","The fact that a FNAF movie even happened is just amazing on its own. I am sure lots of people just wanted something to come out just to have the FNAF name out there (they waited 8 years). It is very cool that it happened but due to a very inexperienced director and Scott Cawthon and others not having much experience in working on movies, it couldn't reach it's full potential.The FNAF franchise has so much great lore and material but a lot of it wasn't used. I'll start with the positives: the animatronics/puppets look fantastic, Jim Henson's team did an amazing job on them. They look about as true to the games as you can get. The cameos of certain people influential to this franchise were very nice to see and some parts were pretty funny. Josh Hutcherson did well as Mike and the guy playing Yellow Bunny (can't remember his name at the moment, he played Shaggy in the Scooby-Doo movies) was also good. The cons of this movie are really all based on the dialogue, writing, editing and directing. Some of the scenes are extremely awkward and even the best actors can't do much with such bad dialogue like there was in this movie. There are some shots that cut away too quickly. Lots of plot holes and sudden shifts in mood and setting that don't make much sense. We don't really get to take our time with the characters and understand them. I know this is supposed to be a simple movie and not a deep one but we should have some sense of their personalities than what was provided. The animatronics weren't as scary as they could have been and they are very scary in the games. The movie just can't decide if it's actually a horror movie or not at times. Overall, this movie had a lot of potential but it just couldn't reach it fully.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","ThomasReviews","1 November 2023","I have been a fan of the Fnaf franchise for years and like most fans, I've been waiting patiently for this movie to release for many years. Now that the movie finally released after 8 years of being in development, I finally got to watch the movie in theaters with one of my friends. Despite my friend enjoying the film, I personally left the film feeling incredibly underwhelmed and disappointed.Now, this film does have good elements, but I feel a lot of the bad outweigh the good. Firstly, the story in this film is really dull. I thought the film started solid but everything else after the beginning was dull, especially the side plot in the film. The movie is barely scary, the moments that tried to be scary literally made me laugh. The animatronics were the best part of the film... when they were actually a threat. I understand most of the lore in the games but what they did with the animatronics half way through rubbed me the wrong way. The actors in the film were okay but not outstanding. Same goes for the characters. Josh Hutcherson was solid as Mike but I kind found his character generic. Matthew Lillard was probably the best part of the movie, it's just a shame he was only in the film for only about 10 minutes. The setting for the film was cool but I knew I was gonna most likely like it. The ending to the film felt honestly rushed, would've benefited if it was a bit longer. The film could've also benefited from an R rating instead of PG-13.Overall, while I don't think the movie was terrible, I don't think it is good at all and was incredibly underwhelming. I am gonna be being completely honest, Scott Cawthon should not have wrote the screenplay. I would've preferred if someone else wrote the screenplay and Scott was a co writer or just a producer. Personally, I would only recommend this movie if you are a die hard Fnaf fan. Outside of that, I would skip this movie all together.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","D4V1D2411","11 December 2023","As the title says, this movie is the perfect example of a movie made for fans, that doesnt make it bad, but it kinda is. The story is made as a resume of a very big part of the games original story, but it delivers it so fast and without a real meaning that it doesnt work at all. This along with the fact that they also add a lot of new stuff, like the drawings that control the animatronics, the visions of the older brother, the aunt and her story, those things take away focus that is needed in the main story, explaing the mistery that this whole pizzeria has, they just present you with elements from the games but dont dive into them, they essentially just work as references. With tthat said, as a fan of the games, I did enjoy and understood much better everything the movie was trying to day, but to someone who doesnt know a thing about the saga, its gonna be a bad and boring movie.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","daniel-66187","29 October 2023","I saw this movie without any ""relationship"" to games or any bond to the YouTube hype. And this movie is pretty bad - even for B horror movie. Effects are fine - but these days even the lowest budget movies have fine effects.So what is left? Well the background story is kinda ok and the acting is also kinda believable.Where I think it goes wrong is when it tries to explain things with science and everyone just accepts obviously wrong assumptions about electricity and mechanics. Why not just embrace the supernatural and let that be the explanation for most things.The big brother is just stupid - I am tired of self-destructive no-good characters. It is just very hard to be sympathetic and be on his side when he keeps making so poor choices. And trauma or mental sickness does explain the choices.This is not scary at all, just kinda weird and frustrating to watch.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","CinemaSerf","2 November 2023","Didn't Josh Hutcherson used to be famous? Well here he is reduced to the role of the struggling brother of ""Abby"" (Piper Rubio). Their aunt (Mary Stuart Masterson) is determined that this hapless bag of bones isn't fit to look after the young girl - after he takes out a visiting father in the fountain of a shopping mall and gets fired; so ""Mike"" has to get another job! Opportunities are thin on the ground, but there is a vacancy doing the security night shift and an old, derelict, pizza parlour. How hard can it be? Well a meeting with the enigmatic police officer ""Vanessa"" (Elizabeth Lail) should have rung alarm bells, and when he has to take ""Abby"" there for one overnight shift - well it's soon clear that this place has secrets to keep and that it knows how to manipulate the hopes and fears of ""Mike"" and his sister. Can they stay sane and focussed long enough to survive this maze of malevolent mechanical bunnies? I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","ciolekmango","27 October 2023","As a longtime fnaf fan, the Fnaf movie is wonderful and disappointing in equal measure. The acting is alright, with the three leads of Mike, his Sister Abby and Vanessa being quite strong, and the rest of the cast, especially Steve Raglim, being aggressively unconvincing. Steve does have some funny moments, which is not uncommon in the film, as even though its a horror movie, there are a lot of good laughs as well. Youtube enjoyers will certainly enjoy seeing some familiar faces on the big screen. One thing that the movie absolutely nails is the visuals. Never has Fnaf looked more alive than in this movie. The team at Jim Henson did an amazing job with the animatronics, and they finally look as I always imagined then to be. Their movements are extremely fluid, and look straight out of a robot workshop. Their designs are fantastic as well, with Chica and Foxy looking absolutely incredible. The animatronics also work very well as both antagonists and deuteragonists. They are creepy, yet charming, intimidating, yet welcoming, which I think is perfect for the haunted animatronics that they are. Speaking of the characters, this is something that I am quite mixed on. Mike is done very well, the audience is given time to understand him, and he is both likable and flawed; a great main centerpiece to ground the story together. Abby is also a great addition. While her character can be simplified to a simple ""little girl character"", she certainly stands out in her own way. She is just as likable as mike, with a quick mouth and a smart mind. Vanessa is ok, but I just think the film did not give her enough time to develop as a character. We are told that her dad roughed her up, but thats about it. Her motivations, and deeper psyche are never really explored, which I think is a shame, since I think she could have been a great compliment to Mike. The movie even teases us with the possibility of exploring her further, with one solo scene of her just staring at a wall, but it never goes deeper than that, which I think is a mistake. As for the actual plot of the movie, this is where it loses me a little. I certainly appreciate the approach of giving the film an actual arc, and I loved much of the background behind the murders in the 80s, but the film is just very stereotypical and cliché. It is a story that I've seen around 100 times, and it really doesn't do anything very imaginative. Mikes character arc is good, but it is largely carried by how likable Mike is as a character, and his growth throughout the film is very predictable. There is also a considerable lack of tension for a lot of the movie, and the last act, where the climax takes place, is very, very short. The last thing I'd like to talk about is the horror, and unfortunately there just isn't a lot of it. The gore is very limited, and there just aren't a lot of very frightening scenes. This may be a big plus for some people, but for me, I watch horror to be scared. The film is clearly built with love, and really enjoyed the visuals and many of the characters, but I think the storytelling holds this movie back from being really great.","

The characters were boring and had no real substance to who they are, but I think that came from the story.The opening scene had promise, but when the story unfolded, they seemed to dwell on unneeded parts of the story. The supporting characters were pointless as well. Like an Aunt who had about as much to do with the story as a toilet seat.

And having several same dreams of 5 children who have disappeared. The film gets repetitive with the dream sequences which slows down the pacing. Its a slow first hour start. When things do pick up. The film lacks the thrills and scares.The acting is decent. The cast ensemble is okay. The music score is cool. Does feel like a similar score that came off from Stranger Things.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","IonicBreezeMachine","28 October 2023","Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a troubled man still dealing with the trauma of having witnessed his brother abducted at a young age and is now struggling to serve as guardian to his younger sister Abby (Piper Rubio) who is often aloof and lost in fantasy. After losing yet another job due to an outburst of his psychosis, career counselor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) offers Mike a job working nights at the closed down family entertainment center Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. As Mike takes the position routinely sleeping and revisiting his recurring dreams of memories of his younger brother's abduction, strange occurrences appear to be happening in his new job that infiltrate his dreams.Five Nights at Freddy's is the long awaited film adaptation of the video game series of the same name created in 2014. With the initial video games becoming quite popular, development on a film began not long after their release with Warner Bros. Acquiring the rights in 2015 only for it to linger in development hell with a revolving door of creative teams and companies attached at various points. Eventually the film gained traction at Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 in spite of similar films like 2019's The Banana Splits Movie or 2021's Willy's Wonderland beating this film to release and trying to ride the franchise's coattails. After an 8 year journey to the screen, Five Nights at Freddy's looks nice but just doesn't have a compelling story or characters that made it seem all that special.To start off on a positive note, Five Nights at Freddy's is a very handsome production and considering it had more resources than Willy's Wonderland or The Banana Splits Movie it certainly can be seen on screen. The animatronics were made by Jim Henson's Creature Shop and manage to avoid looking like guys in suits and actually do feel like clunky heavy animatronics you'd seen in an 80s children's play place. However despite looking the part, Five Nights at Freddy's never felt all that scary and it didn't feel like there was much of a payoff. It's really not the film's fault that some of the novelty has worn off by being beaten to the punch by imitators, but even being imitators those films offered more in terms of memorability like the over the top gore in Banana Splits or Nicolas Cage's mute action hero performance in Willy's Wonderland gave those films that extra something to make them stand out. While Josh Hutcherson is clearly giving his all to the performance, Mike just isn't that interesting as a protagonist and my mind just went to other films that did this concept better some of which came from Blumhouse themselves. M3GAN from earlier this year had a stronger fractured family dynamic and more energy to the horror and entertainment value, and last year's The Black Phone did the concept of a serial child abductor and the victims' ghosts much more intensely. I was very much reminded of that William Brent Bell movie Separation from a few year's ago where it was mostly very stock (with the exception of one or two decent elements) and that's unfortunately where I fell on Five Nights at Freddy's.Five Nights at Freddy's might please diehard fans of this franchise with its attention to detail and plethora of easter eggs, but for me personally I felt underwhelmed beyond the animatronics and production design and I'd welcome a Banana Splits or Willy's Wonderland sequel before wanting one for this one (which they imply with no subtlety is happening).","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","ghalooly-46750","26 October 2023","I grew up with the franchise, so I walked in hoping to at least enjoy the experience regardless of my expectations.. (I did not enjoy the experience)The jumpscares were mostly cheap to the point where people in the theater were laughing. The animatronics did not look scary, unlike the game where I used to have nightmares and call it quits after surviving only one night.I would only say that Josh Hutcherson's performance was great. I enjoyed the cameos too, more than the movie altogether.I'm just disappointed because, like I said, I grew up with the franchise and I was waiting for this movie ever since they announced making it... and it was not worth the wait.And for anyone who says it is a good film, I honestly doubt that we saw the same movie.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","ejwable","30 October 2023","My kids grew up on FNAF and seemed like a great into to horror. I never understood the back story this movie explains it well. As for horror or scares, the movie has minimal. Definitely needed more suspense, killings and jump scares. This movie lack em all. The PG13 rating hurt this movie severely. Need to step it up to R for the sequel. The characters had great potential to make something scary but didn't deliver. Every night got tougher but not this go round. The girl seeing ghosts was a bit confusing at first but played into the story which helped explain the other characters. The movie was good but could've been so much better with an R rating.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","IceCream-57","8 December 2023","This one I have mixed feelings on. I agree with the reviewer that stated the film feels rushed at times. It does. I thought this film was ok, and that is being completely generous. I was interested very strongly in the first 30 minutes but that all faded away fairly quickly. I just lost interest because the plot just wasn't there. The storyline drags at times. Maybe the director and writer could have done a better job developing the characters so that the viewer remains interested but they did not so its just not as good as it could be. Sometimes hard to follow. I would say if you love thrillers give it a shot but you may be disappointed.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jojolena","29 October 2023","I love the FNAF games, and was so excited when I learned they would be creating a movie for the game franchise.The animatronics look very accurate and feel a bit unsettling, but sometimes they felt a bit goofy, in the games they are not like that so it felt a bit strange seeing them fort scene. Sort of split between whether or not I find this addition to be good, because on one side I prefer it when adaptations happen to not twist the original source material too much, but on the other side it helped emphasize the fact that there are children inhabiting the animatronics and they are easily influenced (thus why they would help William Afton perhaps?).The set also looked lovely, the sound and all of that was nice, I feel though that the story was a bit rushed. Overall the games and the movie don't go hand in hand plot-wise which can feel frustrating and confusing to fans of FNAF.The last problem I had is that, even though this is a horror movie it felt way too silly and funny. I feel like for a movie like FNAF they should have used a lot more jumpscares similar to the game. I did not feel scared at any point of the movie. Lastly, while I love Steve Raglan, that last line... just was not it. It felt so unserious and that whole scene could have been handled in a better way.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","deeformecreep","29 October 2023","Honestly I wasn't sure I was going to review this movie but since I have a lot to say I thought might as well.Firstly I want to give my praise for the amazing practical effects from Jim Henson's creature shop. They really do look incredible, and it's awesome to see the animatronics moving around.Secondly I want to praise the direction, Emma Tammi seems like she knows what she is doing, the movie has a distinct look which I enjoyed.And lastly for praise I want to say Josh Hutcherson really gives it his all, he really carried what otherwise might have been a really boring protagonist. I actually really like what they did with his character. I really enjoyed the dream theory thing, and actually found it very interesting.Now to the negatives:Firstly the script itself, it's a mess. I feel like there was definitely a better script a few rewrites away, but alas this is what they went with. There are way too many plot points, and the movie feels unsure of what it wants to be. More time should have been spent fleshing out characters such as Afton, Abby and Vanessa. Characters like the aunt and her thugs could have been completely removed from the movie, their screentime could have been used on the other more important characters.Speaking of Vanessa, boy is she a badly written character, if you can even call her that. She exists to drop information. More time needed to be used on her to explain who she is. She also acts very inconsistently with one moment being happy and then in the next threatening to shoot someone.Next up is William Afton, such a waste of Matthew Lillard. He barely has a presence in the movie despite being the main antagonist. He needed more screentime so his entrance in the final confrontation isn't so random. In turn fleshing him out could also help give us more of Vanessa's backstory. Perhaps we could see her childhood and how William's treatment shaped her.Next up is the lack of horror. The movie isn't scary, and when I say that I mean like at all. I remember in one of the promotional videos Lillard said this would be full of jumpscares, yet I can only recall one. And it didn't even land since you saw it coming a mile a way. Also the lack of a creepy atmosphere really brings the movie down. The animatronics aren't allowed to act creepy, and most of their screentime is either spent in the middle of the film befriending Abby. I was also disappointed we didn't see a single scene of Mike just trying to survive the night like in the games.The final confrontation is rushed. Afton literally just appears out nowhere to taunt Mike. And then gets swiftly killed after Abby replaces a drawing of him with the kids with one where he is killing them.Honestly I hope they work to make the script more tight if a sequel is made, overall I don't hate this movie. And I actually quite enjoyed it despite all my problems with it. I'd give this movie a 6.5/10.","

The movie effectively used the little bits of lore in the first game and made an interesting story out of it.Set design was really good, lighting had many interesting moments, the horror aspect used the mascot horror effectively and the plot was decent. All in all it played to the strengths of the mascot horror genre while keeping the mystery aspect interesting.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jprice-38253","28 October 2023","Five Nights At Freddy's is exactly what you would expect. The sole purpose of coming to watch this movie is simply for the sake of the animatronics and because you're familiar with the games. So the story and the characters are not exactly the motivation for you to see this. Basically they don't matter to you. I'm sure most of us can be honest about that. If it wasn't for the animatronics at all, then why else would you be coming to watch this??It indeed was good to see Josh Hutcherson. Of course him being a B list Actor, we know him mostly from the major works of the past he was in such as: The Hunger Games, Bridge To Teribithia and Zathura. For him leading this movie, he did good. He's never been a person that overacts. It was also good seeing Matthew Lillard, whom we know as Shaggy from the live action Scooby Doo and Scream. The rest of the cast did their parts good as well when it came to acting, but the thing is...for me personally...I didn't seem to feel enough sympathy for either of them. I tried really hard to, but with the story not being the most engaging to me, it was hard to pay attention and really care for the characters. Plus, a lot of moments in here are quite predictable.The animatronics on the other hand were very well done! They executed the look of each of them perfectly! They look exactly like they are from the game and what makes it even better is that none of them are CGI. They are all real standing, moving animatronics. So hats off to that team for actually making them come to life! The Freddy FazBear Pizza Place in itself is also well designed. They managed to create the same look of the place, along with the classic monitor watching that we very well know of.While this is a film I probably won't watch again, I came to see it for the fun of the animatronics. And if you're coming to see this movie specifically with that mindset, then you'll have fun with it. But if you're coming to see it not for the animatronics, then I probably wouldn't bother with it if I were you. Therefore, I wasn't expecting this to be the best nor the worst. So it sits right in the middle just about where it should be. My real rating for this is a 5.5, if I had to grade it by letter, definitely a C+.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","timbowilde","31 October 2023","Firstly I have to hold my hands up and admit at the outset that I'm not much of a fan of the horror genre and after watching this I remembered why. I also have to admit that I only went to see the movie so that I was out of the house on Halloween and I'd seen the other movies on offer. Why this is a 15 certificate baffles me although there is one stabbing incident in it, so. Halfway through the movie I assumed I'd misunderstood not having read much about it and it was actually meant to be a horror spoof because it wasn't scary for on nanosecond. I know it's based on a popular video game so maybe it's aimed at fans of that, but I'm struggling to think of a worse movie I've seen in recent years. I think it has to be up there in the top 10 worst films I've ever seen. When I see movies as bad as this I can't help wondering what the cast thought when they saw the finished movie. Horrified?","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Ethangamer579","26 October 2023","Five Nights at Freddy's is a horror movie that is based on the game series of the same name. It is written by Scott Cawthon and a few others and is produced by Jason Blum while also being directed by Emma Tammi. The film follows Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) who takes the role of Security Guard at the old Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, after getting fired from his old job. On his second night he meets Vanessa Shelly (Elizabeth Lail), a cop who knows a bit too much about Freddy's. On his third night, he brings his younger sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), to the pizzeria. He falls asleep on the job as usual and has the same, reoccurring nightmare about when his brother, Garrett (Lucas Grant), was abducted by a mysterious man. On his final night, Mike has to race to save Abby from becoming one of them. He is helped by Vanessa but she reveals who she truly is, and who the man that abducted Garrett and murdered the five kids was William Afton, her father. Mike stops the animatronics from hurting Abby briefly before William Afton (Matthew Lillard), in the SpringBonnie spring lock suit that he murdered the kids in, arrives and fights Mike. He tries to get Abby but is stopped by Vanessa, who he then stabs. While he deals with Vanessa though, Abby draws a picture to show the animatronics that William is the bad man who hurt them. The animatronics turn on William and the Cupcake bites at the suit, exposing the spring locks. The spring locks snap shut on William and he yells ""I always come back!"" before falling to the ground where he is then dragged away. Mike and Abby visit Vanessa in the hospital and the movie ends there. Overall, Five Nights at Freddy's is a great horror film with jumpscare's, comedy, shocking reveals and fan service for all the Fnaf nerds. The movie might not be for everybody and that's fine, but this is a movie that I wholeheartedly loved. 10/10 would recommend.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","iamloud2","27 October 2023","I thought it was great! It was a good mixture of all of the games with some newer elements and even some bits of new lore to explore further in future films.It was entertaining - full of fun easter eggs and cameos for fans, yet containing enough context through storytelling to help clue newcomers in without being too overbearing.Any ""critics"" who say it's bad are mad because it isn't another melodramatic, monochromatic film full of sorrow that's next in line to win an Oscar then fade into obscurity with the rest of the boring, monotonous films before it.This movie is for us, not for them. Don't let critics deter you from watching. If you like this sort of thing or even just find it interesting then good for you - I encourage you to give it a try. If not, then it doesn't matter. You don't have to watch it. But make that decision for yourself - don't let anyone else do it for you.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","nawinds","26 October 2023","Anyway it's hard to write an exciting plot based on this game... I think this plot is more like a plot of some cartoon, not a film. However it's far different from the video game and for me was rather unexpected. Don't expect that the security guard Mike will be sitting in a room with CCTV through the film, he won't. Moreover, he won't be the only victim of animatronics.Except for Mike there was a police officer, who was also engaged in investigation of animatronics night activity for some reason (no spoilers at this point) as well as Mike's younger sister, who eventually was the one to get everyone in troublejust becauseofher own curiosity.I can't say it is a scary film at all. It only has about 6 screamers. Well, there also were some disgusting scenes at the end, but they are more disgusting, than scary. And in my view, they'd better didn't include them, as I find them disrespectfulfor the viewers.All in all, fans of the game can see the other, extended legend of what's happening in pizzeria. But don't think this will be a masterpiece. I would rate it as 6.5 out of 10.","

I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this one, it was just terrible. The director couldn't direct their way out of a toilet. It was that bad.You know, I'm a big fan of winning, and this movie, it's a big, fat loser. I don't know what they were thinking when they made it. The animatronic animals, they were supposed to be scary, but they looked like they were made by a bunch of amateurs. It was low energy, folks, low energy.And the story, it was all over the place. I like a good story, a great story, but this one, it was a disaster. I couldn't even follow it, and I'm a very stable genius, you know. It's like they didn't even try.So, in conclusion, the Five Nights at Freddy's movie, it was a complete and total disaster. A tremendous waste of time. Don't watch it, folks, don't watch it.

There are many scenes of intense peril (most scenes are of intense peril, in fact). I was genuinely shocked at the amount of violence and blood in this movie, there was more of that in this PG-13 movie than in any other PG-13 movie I've seen , and even more than in some rated R horror movies I've seen. This movie has a higher on-screen body count than the most recent installment in the Conjuring franchise.

I see it has a high rating but that's where it's confusing to me because I don't get why. I know it's based on the video game franchise of the same name but even still, there's nothing about this film that makes it good. Especially for ratings that are 7 and up. I did see a preview of this beforehand but even that just wasn't appealing to me.This might be because I don't play video games anymore but this was just boring to me. It's really not even considered ""horror"" to me. It's more like comedy disguised as horror.

A movie that feels like it's been machine-learned and reverse-engineered from YouTube fanfic, rather than rooted in any kind of recognizable human experience, behavior, or psychology.There are moments where it feels like it could have become a more gleefully mean-spirited horror ride by really sinking its teeth into the story and actually biting down, but it remains hamstrung by the rating as well as a lack of creativity. Five Nights at Freddy's fails at being scary. The premise and setting should've made it an obvious horror win, but some baffling story choices and poor execution makes it feel like a missed opportunity.My Rating : 4/10.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jlukeritters","28 October 2023","In the eyes of a normal movie goer the Five Nights at Freddy's movie isn't anything special. It's a confusing story with an outlandish story coupled with cringey campy dialogue and not being really scary. But in the eyes of a FNAF fan who waited 8 long years for this movie to become a reality... it's everything you'd hope and dream for! Like come on, a confusing convoluted story, that's basically the entire lore of Five Nights at Freddy's! The callbacks and references in this movie will make you want to stand up and cheer in the theater!The ""horror"" isn't exactly that scary but at times the movie does match the creepy and terrifying atmosphere the animatronic characters give off in the games but it's only in the beginning of the movie and one sequence at around the halfway mark when thieves break in and smash up Freddy's to get Mike, the current guard, fired. The animatronics pick them off one by one and at times can be fairly brutal.The star of this movie is easily Matthew Lillard, although it's criminal that he has so little screen time, his portrayal of William Afton is spot on and his acting skills show. One example of this is when Mike is being interviewed by William and as William reads Mikes file he notices his last name and freezes his demeanor changes almost immediately going from a normal career counselor dealing with another client to an almost nervous demeanor almost like he has something to hide from Mike (which we find out later William abducted and killed Mikes younger brother) and immediately offers the Security job at Freddy's. He almost seems desperate in having Mike take the job at times hinting that he wants Mike to go there to be killed so he'll never find out it was Afton who killed his brother. Later on in his final scenes Matthew truly shows off his ability to play this murderous psychopath ,as he has shown in his previous films, as he brilliantly brings the character of William Afton to life in the iconic spring lock suit. He even goes as far as stabbing his own daughter but Matthew portrays a moment of slight remorse and regret after doing so perfectly, and during his death scene he quotes Aftons most iconic line from the games ""I ALWAYS COME BACK"" although the line delivery is a little rushed ,come on, we've been waiting for someone to say that on the big screen for 8 years now! Matthew is the MVP of the movie for sure!The PG-13 rating does hold back the movie in some areas most importantly the spring lock scene which I will admit is a little too tame and bloodless for such a gruesome sounding death. An R rating would have really helped this movie convey the horror and sheer terror of these massive possessed machines but the movie does push the PG-13 rating to the limit in terms of violence and in a good way! One particular scene is when one of the characters from the aforementioned break in gets pulled into the mouth of Freddy and gets chomped in HALF! Even in the games this never happens so it took everyone in the theater by surprise but like I said before in a good way. Another scene shows one of the robbers getting there face chewed up by the Cupcake, and later on we see the gory aftermath.The other actors are fine there are some campy and corny lines but it's FNAF it's to be expected but no there is no ""we are fnaf"" scene but there is a scene where the night guard along with his sister and Vanessa, Afton's daughter, build a pillow fort with the animatronics. Yes it's campy and Bonnie even falls over and gives a thumbs up when asked if he's ok but it's important to keep in mind these are children possessing these robots and the movie needs a scene to get the audience to sympathize with them in some way before they turn on Afton at the end of the movie so this was the best course of action in my opinion.Overall the movie is perfect for fans and for me personally (a fan) it is a perfect 10/10 but for an average movie goer who doesn't know anything about the lore or what came before this movie honestly I can see why they wouldn't like this movie and rate it 4/10 or lower.","

It's essentially two movies in one and they don't gel well together at all. The iconic FNAF elements that people are going to want to se feel wholly and totally out of place in its own movie.The script chooses to focus on all the wrong things filled with sub plots and pointless side characters I frankly could not have cared less about. Any sentimental moments ending falling totally flat and come across as cheesy in all the worst ways. These animatronics never feel threatening at all and anything that comes close to a violent moment feels so tame in how it's executed that they never leave any impact. The script is chock full of ear scraping, cringeworthy dialogue and even knowing nothing about this IP I don't think there was a single surprise in the entire runtime.I had next to no expectations for this movie and I'm still baffled at just how bad this movie turned out to be. I might not have every played the game but if I had to guess I can't imagine fans really finding this story satisfying as an adaption.

If this were a rated R film, I think we would have been gifted actual jump scares and a heightened sense of fear. About three times during the movie I was ready to just turn it off.Josh Hutcherson has never been compelling to me for his adult career. As for the relationship between Mike and his younger sister Abby, that was kind of cute. But excessive cuteness/cuddliness (such as the scene where everyone builds the fort) is guaranteed to spoil a supernatural thriller.A true let down.","

Whoever wrote it has obviously never written a script before, the directors forgot to tell the actors to act, and the one liners are so out of line it's awful, and did Matt part seriously make a cameo and say ""it's just a theory"" a peoce of me died in that moment. You've ruined my whole year with how awful this movie is, I pray to God you don't even ruin it more with a garbage time sequel. The ending was stolen from first novel book as well but wasn't nearly as good. Gross awful movie, script 1/10 costume design 8/10 directing 1/10 acting 2/10 plot -10/10.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jamiesbeck","29 October 2023","I'm writing this with assistance of a hard-core 10 year old die hard fan.I'm not a huge Five Nights at Freddy's fan but I am by proxy. My other kids have grown up with it. They have always loved all things scary. So to say they were let down was an understatement. They actually called it ""horrible"". As an adult I tried to explain to them they had to make a movie that was watchable for everyone and not just the fans of the video games. That being said they were right. There is a scene in the middle of the movie, no spoilers, but it was just bad. Bad in every aspect. Another thing is, it was VERY rushed. They tried to get more story in than needed in their alloted amount of time. I'd give it a 5 for average. And like most other movie's there was so much that could have been improved.It is what it is. Another rushed Hollywood project cash in. I'm sure Scott is just happy to have it finally made but at the cost of true fans. My son was more excited by a certain cameo and close out song. There was no sexual content for the record. The movie is not scary. Some gore. Lots of cheesy bad. Since it was profitable before it was even released, which should tell you something about the rush job on low budget, there will certainly be another for them to cash in on.","

You're not going to find any of that here. Drags on and on with the lame attempt at a backstory to make the main character sympathetic.Why was the writer so hellbent on making this about an abduction? It added nothing and sucked all the energy out of the film, making it drag on and on with almost no payoff in the end.It's hilarious that a movie based on a jump scare video game is taking itself so seriously. If you want countless eye roll inducing heartfelt monologues, than this movie is for you.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","leohasmail","27 October 2023","The long awaited Five Nights at Freddy's movie is here, and what does it contain? Absolute garbage.Instead of retelling the events of literally anything in the movie, they made more of an alternate universe thing. William is never mentioned by name, Mike's sister is now Abby, the crying child is named Garret, and Garret was kidnapped. Did any of this ever happen in the story? No, never. Mike isn't even related to William in this movie.Also, the movie is barely scary. They should've just went R instead of PG-13 and made it ACTUALLY scary.If you know nothing about FNaF, then you probably won't like this movie. If you are a dedicated fan who knows everything there is to know, you might not like this movie. If you're looking for a retelling of any of the lore, there's no hope for you.Don't spend your money or time on this movie. You will walk out of the theatre disappointed.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","anyanimeotoho","21 November 2023","""Five Nights at Freddy's"" starts alright, with a fairly unsettling atmosphere and a curious plot. The movie changes tonally after the first plot reveal about how the animatronics operate, but it still keeps its momentum and the plot still has the potential to entertain, since we're well past the horror at this point. However, the film just devolves into a mess after this, trying to tie its set-to-fail subplot involving the main character (i.e. Mike's brother) with several others (the missing children, Abby, Vanessa and her father) in a non-cohesive way. Each subsequent reveal just feels like an attempt to connect different parts of the larger story with more twists and turns, but it's very lazily done. It's not like the plot feels rushed at any point, some of these bits are actually too drawn out for their good. The second half of the movie is either boring or nonsensical at any given moment, and I'm left with more questions than answers at the end of the movie. The whole thing just feels contrived and not well thought-out; the story ultimately doesn't flow well. Couple the cliche-ridden writing with some wobbly acting and a very anticlimactic end, and I found myself staring at the rolling credits in disbelief as an annoying tune played in the background. The only consistent thing this movie has going for it is the visuals. I learnt that there are tons of easter eggs for fans to pick up, so... that's something. However, if you're not a fan of the games, do yourself a favour and skip this.","

I liked the idea of the movie, but what the hell is this? Micheal isn't an Afton, which in the games, it was hinted that he was, the actors were amazing, and the production was great, but the storyline is disgusting compared to the games. Abby is a whatever character, she wasn't needed. But Garret? What did he have to do with anything? You could've at least named him Chris, or CC, like in the game. And Steve was the cover name for William? *Sigh*
They gave an uneeded storyline for what? And Vanessa's William's daughter? That feels like whoever wrote the movie was on acid or something. This movie was disgusting. Amazing graphics, amazing actors, horrible story.","

It is a nice story without pretension, with little or no blood.Despite the fact that the film is 16+ I think this is a youth film. So you are also watching a story geared to young adolescents. The suspense, the characters and the romance are tuned for this age.So it is about some mechanical dolls that take their own initiative and are sometimes very threatening. But there is more to it.So highly recommended for all FNAV adepts like my son and for people who want to see a friendly horror movie.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","JTReviewsPlus","5 November 2023","Five Night's At Freddy's finds itself somewhere in-between being a passion project made by fans of the games and a terrible video game movie adaptations of decades past.It manages to pay respects to the creepy animatronics in terms of appearance and lore (to a certain extent) but the movie severely lacks all of the new story elements made specifically for the film. A game can't just be simply copied onto the big screen especially the Five Nights At Freddy's Franchise where the story is told throughout several games and other media in a non-linear manner.For the uninitiated, Five Night's At Freddy's is about a security guard who is forced to monitor the night shift for Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a long-forgotten restaurant that closed years ago only to discover the animatronics are not as they seem.The movie tries to characterize the security guard by giving him a tragic backstory and a sister that he has to care for and protect but it doesn't work at all. The entire cast gives it their all but the writing doesn't do anyone justice. Important backstory comes across as heavy handed exposition at times and key information was withheld from other characters for no reason at all. Logic, a majority of time, is thrown out of the window and your mileage on ignoring it will vary.Five Nights At Freddy's only saving graces are the movie's beautifully haunting camera work, the iconic animatronics and popcorn-filled campiness.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","DeanAmythe","22 November 2023","Hey Scott, maybe you just needed one more script revision.I occupy the seemingly uncommon position of absolutely loving the FNAF games and everything around them when I was a kid, but lacking any nostalgic attachment, which turned out to provide me the perfect angle to approach this film from: I know enough about the original material and its lore to be able to understand what was going on, but experience a certain distance from it which allowed me to have an unbiased view. And let me tell you, the way this handles its story is absolutely terrible. This doesn't even try to walk the fine line of providing enough clarity for the unaware audience while entertaining passionate fans with hints at the bigger picture, instead it just ungracefully topples to either side of it. Either its overexplaining itself (the main character finds out about the whole 'kid ghosts' thing, spouts it to the audience as inelegantly as possible, and just accepts it as a fact in a single scene) or the background mechanisms take centre stage in what I imagine will be total incoherence to anyone not familiar with them. And that's without mentioning the awkward inserts of fan service that I imagine are what 'legacy hero stepping into the light' moments must be for people who don't know them. Revealing a character's last name doesn't mean a thing to the general audience, but it insists on its importance.The imbalance isn't reserved for only this, though. The tone itself is, to put it lightly, all over the place. In the same scene you'll have scares that are trying to be genuinely frightening (none of the jumpscares work by the way, and that's coming from someone who can usually be seen leaping in his seat) and a second later there's moments that would feel straight at home in a more campy version of this or are simply unintentionally hilarious (lots of examples to be found in Chica's cupcake, somehow the most capable force among the animatronics). It never dedicates itself to a single direction, so instead you get both laughable horror and baffling moments of levity. There's also about 20 minutes in the second half where everyone is just having a good time and it is without a doubt one of the most ""what the hell am I watching"" moments in recent memory.The unintended hilarity of the whole thing is only rivaled by how passionately the diehards are defending it, from the usual response to the low critics score on Rotten Tomatoes to a Reddit post I've seen where someone listed a bunch of now considered masterpieces that were not received well on release, citing, among others, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Fight Club as examples.During my showing the theatre crew was constantly kicking a bunch of kids out who were not old enough to see it (in the Netherlands it's rated 16+), but honestly, I don't blame them sneaking in anyways. This is definitely one aimed towards younger audiences (and Reddit manbabies, as it seems) who will uncritically chuck a 10/10 at this. For everyone else, however, this is worth little more than your usual Netflix Original horror flick or average Blumhouse fare.","

However, it is no excuse for the poor storytelling and characters.The over reliance on dream sequences and dumb characters to move the plot is very tedious and the actual horror have taken a drastic backseat which is a shame cause I do like the first game atmosphere a lot. The actual villain is wasted and rushed at the last minutes of the movie which made the journey extra tedious to me(specially that it's very obvious who's the villain in a this called mystery movie).I really wanted to like this movie, I really did but it really didn't do anything for me. Still, go watch it and make your own opinion on it.","

I came to see evil animatronics stalk and mangle people in an abandoned pizza place. Instead I got what I get in many modern horror films: a 90 minute grief counceling session with bits of very light horror spinkeled in here in there. We spend hardly any time at Freddie's at all. We do spend a lot of time in Mike's dull and very repetitive dreams. And no, Nightmate Freddie does not make an appearance.This movie suffers from a serious case of script-itis. I get that the story needs some padding out to make it feature length, but things get so conveluted without getting interesting that the filmmakers completely loose sight of what we came to see. Killer. Animatronics.It's a real shame that the company that made the best killer doll movie in recent memory with M3GAN turned a beloved franchise with endless potentional into this terrible dud.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","eoinageary","25 October 2023","The gateway horrorI think this is a perfect movie for kids who are wanting to watch something scarier than hocus pocus but aren't up for the conjuring.The story is of Mike (Josh Hudgerson), he gets a job to take care of his sister, the job is from a guidance counsellor (Matthew Lillard) doing night security in Freddie Fazbears, making sure nothing gets in...or out. With a disturbing past, Mike uncovers some secrets that line up with his past trauma that haunts him still, will he survive the night?Okay, so it's a 6 for many reasons, it's not bad it's just much more kiddy than I thought. The dialogue is a bit goofy and the music is, fine. There is a tone in the movie that makes it feel a little pulled between ideas, not sure how I feel about it.Josh was good, I haven't seen him in a while but he was a good fit as the big brother, the animatronics where cool, freaky at times but there was a section of the movie that again they felt goofy, still knowing they were actual props is very cool !!The end was a little rushed, I think fans of the game will enjoy it a lot as my cinema was screaming at certain lines hahaha lots of kids which is cool to see they are getting into horror early.I love Matthew Lillard, he was in this a small bit but was my favourite, probably will be a second if this makes a lot of cash hahaha fun family Halloween movie, 6/10.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","liammarklh","4 November 2023","I just finished watching this movie on streaming, I had wanted to see this in theaters, but in the interest of saving money and because no one else wanted to go with me, I decided to watch it at home and honestly, I wasn't really sure how to feel about it.The short of it is that I liked the movie for what it was, but I felt that it could have been so much more in the grand scheme of things and should have cut out a lot of superfluous things, but that's just me. As a FNAF fan myself, I think the movie is serviceable and fans will love seeing this come to life, much like I did.I loved the cinematography, the sets, the costumes especially and the design of the animatronics. They really nailed the look of this film. Freddy Fazbear Pizza had all the hallmarks of an 80's style pizzeria, and I loved the little nods to the games, the cameos from Youtubers and the visuals were great.Matthew Lillard stole the movie for me, he's absolutely perfect for this role and casting him as William Afton was a smart choice. He chews up scenery, he embodies the craziness of the villain from the video game series and while I did predict his involvement, I think introducing him this early and then potentially killing him off was a bit unnecessary.Despite me liking this film, I do have some negatives.I think Josh Hutcherson as Mike Schmidt was a huge miscast, the guy looks half asleep and bored in his role. He can't emote to save his life and upon seeing sentient animatronics, this guy is just so casual and chill about walking machines roaming about when he should be screaming his head off or running out of that place and finding a new job. He wasn't the worst, but I feel that his role should have been similar to the games, where he tried surviving each night for the paycheck and figured out unique ways to beat the machines, but that's just me. I also don't get why he couldn't ask any of his neighbors to watch his sister, this movie would not happen if he had been smart and left his sister with another babysitter.His little sister, Abby, was the worst character in this movie. She was so annoying, whiny and nonsensical. She feels like a pointless addition to this movie and I kind of find it icky that her potential autism is treated like some kind of magical gimmick. I also think she could have been cut from the movie completely and we'd not miss much.Vanessa's inclusion in this movie is peculiar. She's an alright character and services the plot well, and I like how she's related to Afton and lured Mike to the pizzeria due to her gaslighting abusive father's demands, but she has no chemistry with Mike and comes across like a manic pixie dream girl. If she's meant to be Mike's love interest, I hope a sequel film builds up their relationship if she ever wakes up from her coma. Also why is she a cop when she has other things to do when on patrol?Mike's aunt is a right see you next Tuesday if you know what I mean. I don't get why she wants to adopt her niece if she hates her so much. Even if she gets a check for taking her in, I'm sure any competent social worker would spot the clear emotional neglect were she to be in custody of her. I don't get why Mike would entrust her to babysit his sister when they both hate her guts, but that's how it is. Also, it makes no sense for her to hire people to ruin Mike's job when he's not duty. Why trash the place when he's not there, it made no sense to me.My biggest problem with this film is that the editing, sloppy pacing and illogical story beats feel like it's being taken too seriously. This movie should have been cheesy and embraced it's comical video game roots. It also should have been rated R and not PG-13. This kind of movie doesn't work when it's not gruesome or twisted. You don't need to be gory, but be tasteful with the death scenes.The ending reveal of the career counselor as Afton was great, but I don't get why this serial killer was so obsessed with this one guy and his family when he's killed other children before. I suppose tormenting him is the goal, but I dislike how underutilized he was in this film. He's the only actor who seemed to be enjoying himself, everyone else felt like a wet blanket.I wish this movie had a better script and story. There was so much potential for something else. I wish they had gone about scenes differently and it was proofread to make more sense, but for what it was, the movie was dumb fun and the fans love it, so I can't complain.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","FlixFLos","2 November 2023","Where should I start?Firstly, what mainly characterizes the FNAF franchise, besides it's character design, is it's lore. It's complicated subplots and secondary character storylines that end up connecting to each other. All of which were absolutely ignored and vagely resembled the original source.Do you want to make a whole new thing, inspired by the games? That's alright (though I believe it's a huge missed opportunity), but we can work with that.However, the problem is, this movie does NOT stand by itsfelf. It has absolutely no idea what it wants to be.It starts as a drama, then turns into poorly animated gore, then suddenly it's a lazily written sitcom. This movie jumps into genres like it was Super Mario, and none of them really seems to fit.The plot is an atrocity. Spends 1/3 of screen time on a bunch of side villains that barely have anything to do with the main story. Until the script itself realizes it's a waste of time and gets rid of them.I could go on for a while, but it's not worth it. It's so bad it could be considered unintentional comedy.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","nightwishouge","31 October 2023","Fans love to defend movies that get blasted by critics. ""This is a movie for real people,"" they say. ""Not elitists in ivory towers."" Well, sometimes critics are right, and honestly I get annoyed that fans are so eager to line up for buffets of mediocrity and chow down like they're being gifted filet mignon. ""Don't bother making any effort on our part,"" they say to movie studios, ""we'll be satisfied with any crap you want to feed us."" Wouldn't it be nice if we held filmmakers to a higher standard? If your favorite IP could be made into a movie AND that movie could also be, you know, good? It's not actually an impossible dream. You just have to stop licking boots.Oh, well. It's just a movie. It's not like lives hang in the balance, I guess. But they did get my money, so I think I have a right to complain.Whenever a much-anticipated movie takes forever to get into production, the excuse is always the same: the filmmakers are waiting for the right script. Then you see the finished film and think, ""THAT was the right script? Surely at least one of the other two dozen options from the slush pile was better than this one."" Five Nights at Freddy's suffers from a standard plot involving a security guard with haunted eyes trying to pull his life together so his aunt won't take custody of his younger sister. Yawn. But wait, if you were worried the dour protagonist doesn't have a Tragic Backstory, you're in luck! His younger brother (a different younger sibling than the one he's raising now) was abducted from a campsite when they were children, and Older Brother feels responsible as the only witness. Do his recurring nightmares about the incident tie in somehow with the current spooky shenanigans unfolding at the arcade-slash-pizza-place known as Freddy Fazbear's? If you think they do not, you've obviously never seen a film before.Despite the story being so thin you could use it as tissue paper next time you're wrapping a gift, the screenwriters (including FNaF creator Scott Cawthon and director Emma Tammi) stretch the rusty plot mechanics to nearly two hours. Why? Who knows? Even the pre-FNaF cash-ins like The Banana Splits Movie and Willy's Wonderland were smart enough to keep the action under 90 minutes. The film is chock full of characters that absolutely do not matter, like love-interest/cop Vanessa (fulfilling the obnoxious archetype of ""character who knows more than she lets on about the scary goings-on but refuses to adequately warn the main character so he has no idea what kind of trouble he's getting himself into until it's too late for everybody"") and waste-of-time-and-talent sneerfest Aunt Jane, perplexingly played by the overqualified '90s ingenue Mary Stuart Masterson. I guess everybody needs a paycheck. The screentime dedicated to superfluous characters ensures that our main protagonists, sadboy Mike and his preadolescent sister Abby, receive zero of the development necessary to actually make them interesting or complex.There's exactly one good scene in Five Nights, involving a group of intruders getting picked off one at a time by the animatronics. Tammi shows the aplomb of a PG-13 Sam Raimi, energizing the sequence with rapid-fire editing and kinetic camera movements and suggesting violence with shadows and abstractions that feel like fun artistic choices rather than concessions to the MPAA. Would that Tammi had been let off the leash more often. As we were treated to the umpteenth scene of Josh Hutcherson attempting to interrogate ghosts in his repeating dream, I kept myself awake by pondering why Cawthon was apparently so insistent that his hollow, schlocky video game premise be turned into this turgid melodrama instead of an adrenaline-fueled, no-holds-barred free-for-all. The final showdown, unfortunately, commits the greatest sin of all: anticlimax.My two notes of genuine appreciation for the film come down to the impressive, full-size animatronics created by the Jim Henson shop--thank God the film avoided CGI--and Matthew Lillard working his butt off to be the same gleeful scenery-chewer he was back in Scream, albeit with a much weaker character this time around. Other than that, I suppose I'm just glad the film avoids the same cynical, empty ""wokespeak"" that plagues other franchises aiming for Gen Z (not a self-conscious reference to ""patriarchy"" or ""gaslighting"" throughout the entire runtime, wonder of wonders). It's a tired movie, but at least it's merely tired in its old-fashioned storytelling rather than in a futile attempt to be up-to-the-minute as bait for ""teh kidz"".If you're going to see it, see it in the theater, with fans of the video games attending in full cosplay regalia, cheering at Easter eggs and applauding any moment that musters even a smidgen of genuine entertainment value. I did, and the atmosphere accounted for about 80% of the actual fun quotient of the entire experience.","

The subject matter is dark, very dark and the situation however absurd connects perfectly with the subject matter, only Blumhouse don't follow through as with so many of their movies, it shows promise then weakens, and ends up Meh
But for two acts it's promising if lacking in some much needed gore, we did Hammer we don't need Hammer, give us some pay off, we don't see any body or rather baddy get any comeuppance, and they do obviously just want to make another so they forgot to actually just make a great third act, in a way the premise got too uncomfortable for them and they bailed, I genuinely thought I'd hate this, but I didn't, in the end I was disappointed because I liked it and the set up, the subject, the scenario, could have been great, it could have been The Shining but it wasn't even Chucky! Blumhouse seems to have a blueprint for a middle of the road product that doesn't rock too many boats, and so studios feel comfortable with their low budget safe box office fayre, it's a great business model but makes for run of the mill cinema.","

Its a fun movie that you would watch with mates or if you are a fan of FNAF.It would have helped if it featured more gore and possibly an 18 rating this would have added the horror elements that would make a good horror film. The concept of FNAF is not very scary to me. So I don't see the film as a horror movie but more as a thriller, maybe with horror elements. A few effective jump scares throughout the film but I wouldn't say I was filled with any kind of fear. Some moments have you questioning if you are even watching a horror film as it is more light despite the plot being fairly dark.The setting is amazing-the restaurant looks incredible, I'm sure game fans appreciated it a lot, the robots look great mixed with the sound which makes it perfect when we see them on screen, it all works so well together. As a fan of the games it really made me appreciate the film more due to these reasons.The films ""twist"" is some what predictable and almost called out earlier in the film. If you are going into this film blind without any knowledge of the games then you might be more surprised.The cast was good, Stu from Scream comes back as a creepy old guy, love it.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","willbrailey","25 November 2023","I just want to start by explaining what I mean when I say that this film is arguably one of the biggest missed opportunities in modern horror cinema.FNAF effectively defined millennial and gen z video game horror in the 2010s. It dominated a decade with one long lore driven cannon that to this day entices and fascinates, for good reason. The depth and attention to detail Scott put into this world he created is ground breaking.FNAF the movie was something that would come out as an instant horror classic and a serious contribution to the genre entirely. With no right being poor in quality given the source material Scott made.I learnt something when I watched this film for the first time, something seriously important to me as an aspiring writer and director.It is often demanded by fan bases that original creators or creatives be brought onto adaptive projects to maintain not only the legitimacy of the adaptation, but also the expected quality. Scott Cawthon wrote the screenplay for the FNAF movie. Which doesn't even come into the same realm as the games he once created. This movie got me thinking that even a story's creator can lose touch and sight of what made his work beloved in the beginning. I'm not saying that's exactly what happened here. But this film brought me to the realisation that it's entirely possible.I have already said a lot so I'll just say that the FNAF movie is just a spooky movie, nothing more nothing less. It's a fast food horror movie, bringing nothing new in the shadow of the games it's based on. The simplicity that gave the original games their one of a kind tone and atmosphere, is entirely absent here. The film complicates and over explains source material that was perfect the first time it was made.All this film had to do was retell the games in a movie format. Keep it accurate to the games and don't stray unnecessarily. With that I don't doubt we would have had the next iconic horror franchise in film. That could have gone on to define the 2020s, just as the games did for the 2010s. However, what we got was a standard nothing movie that will fall out of relevance alongside most generic horror. In a manor very similar to the Scream franchise which I hold close to my heart.Looking back at the games and the impact they had coupled with the fan base they have established since. Compare that to what this film gave us. Dont tell yourself that it isn't a opportunity wasted.Have a good one.","

Everyone who knows the story lore knows it wasnt a disappointment, now with that being said i know other people moght not like or understand it as well IF and its a big if, they dont really understand the plot of the lore or anything in general. But overall i really enjoyed the movie and loved everything about it, nothing made me hate or dislike the movie in the slightest. Really hope we get another fnaf movie n the coming years. Beautiful piece of work this movie was, honestly. Cant wait to see what scott has in store for us next.","

The amount of times i paused the movie to make out with my screen was CRAZY. William afton shouldve been British, but since the American they replaced him with is so FINE, i wont get mad about it. He deserved that role as 1# dilf, and he played it well. And i just LOVED the 10 minute steam room scene with mike and william, it truly was an amazing experience. As far as other movies, they should have Matthew return for the role of springtrap. Anyway it was the best movie ever ong ong fr fr.","

The movie states it's PG 13 but I found it more to an adults taste in horror.The theme was fascinating as it was meant to be lovable. The stars are relatively unknowns but they held my attention with their acting skills. Most of the film is in one area but that's to be expected in a horror movie.The horror comes across suddenly and to my amazement I was shocked by it.Overall I enjoyed this movie and would have given it a TEN except for the having to write SIX hundred words to make a point. The movie, story, film was good. But really this volume of words is stupid.","

Also when did vanesa get there... loved the experience to go to the movies with my friends but this is so lore inaccurate, trust I still love the franchise and fnaf in general but this was just disappointing like Scott come on...

I'm really glad that Scott was involved in the process of making this film and I'm glad that the Director treated this franchise with the respect that I deserve. Jason Blum did a really good job producing The film. The animatronics are amazing thanks to the Jim Henson Company. The Cameos were amazing as well I loved that MatPat was involved that was a complete shocker to me. He really kept that secret really good. I really did wish Markiplier was in there though but I understand due to scheduling conflicts he couldn't but it was still really great movie.","

Glad I saw it on peacock then go to the theater to watch it. I expected a better story to this movie. The trailer makes it seem so scary but the real viewing experience makes the perspective less interesting by the minute. The acting was so weird especially by the little girl. The writing to this movie looks like there's a fear of Chuck E. Cheese. I bet the video game would be more enjoyable than the movie. What's the point of this movie anyway? Truly this is a wild imagination. I'm surprised anybody enjoyed it. No little kids should watch this. This could traumatize them for life.","

I brought the kids and they loved it but I did too. I caught myself nail biting a couple times( 40yr).I do recommend. Especially if you want to see a movie. It's in-depth and detailed. Good acting. Corny at times but it's not all about the acting it's about the awesome animatronics. They put a lot into this flick.$$$. Good story.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","elizabnguyen","30 October 2023","Where was the lore. Where were the jumpscares. Why did they build a pillow fort. I get that the animatronics were just kids and i appreciate that the movie humanized them and emphasized on that but i hated the vibe of ""let's all come together and stop springtrap!! Together..we are fnaf!"". Like i remember being genuinely nervous while playing the games and i don't think that that same thrill was conveyed to the movie. I appreciate the attention to detail and the little easter eggs hinting at things from the games, like shadow freddy and sparky, and the fact that they did that showed that they were 100% able to make the movie less like a teamwork and friendship movie and more like a horror/psychological thriller. Even though they were just kids, they were also killing animatronics. They turned against william so quickly because apparently the answer to all of this was a drawing? I wish there was at least mention of the security cams having limited battery, seeing them pop up in the cams more, but the only real good scene in that nature was when they went for the people that broke in. Objectively not a horrible movie, but disappointing.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Reenoeh","27 October 2023","I think there was A LOT of expectation I heard of the games, watched some gameplay saw the hype all those years back and so the stakes were high!Does this movie deliver? The costumes are well done CGI, the mood of the early 00s is there too aaand that's pretty much it. The jump scares and not scaring, the story is SO GENERIC literally every single plot point is visible from the first 10 minutes and not even the twist in the end is twisting. I watched it on double speed and was still a little bored..It might be a great movie for children without the 2 gory scenes and with them included I feel like this is for the people that loved the let's plays and games/books and are now in their late teens/early twenties. It's about the characters not the story or horror elements. Just nostalgia for that fangroup.For everyone else I wouldn't recommend. I liked seeing Josh Hutcherson again but that's not reason enough to recommend.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","javerylarson","28 October 2023","Awesome movie faithful to the game! It made you feel like you were inside the game because of the intense uneasy feeling it provided. The animatronics were breathtaking to look at. I loved that the Jim Henson Workshop did a masterful work to make the animatronics puppets instead of CGI. I loved how they used the lore of the dead children possessing the robots, which added an otherworldly feel to the film. Josh Hutcherson was amazing as Mike Schmidt, he was a very complex and emotional character. My favorite performance was Matthew Lilliard as William Afton! He was perfect for the role because he was both charismatic and terrifying to watch! I got the chills when he was onscreen! My only complaint is the dream plot felt a little unnecessary and I wish we would have gotten more scenes at the pizzeria with the animatronics. I also wish Abby's ability was explored more because it was a little confusing at times, but other than that, it was a phenomenal movie!","

Any FNAF fan should be proud of what has been made and will love every moment thanks to the clever hidden details and certain scenes. Even if you are new to the franchise this is a fantastic horror made by the incredible BLUMHOUSE. The scares are sure to make you jump and the plot is great too. Honestly couldn't be better. Seeing the iconic animatronic characters come to life is truly incredible and almost like a dream come true from being such a big fan. It's a must watch for anyone.","

There were some lore accurate parts, but mostly it was just messed up and random stuff was added. Like for everyone who knows the games and story, it's frustrating. Like the story of the movie was patched up from different games, but I think it was supposed to be like the first part. The movie wasn't scary at all, almost no jumpscares. Everything that was scary in the game was just taken away. The whole vibe, music and sounds. It was just a generic horror movie, very predictable. The movie overall wasn't very good, even for people who don't know the story and for the fans who have waited for a long time, it's just disappointing.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","yzjgsxwn","11 November 2023","To preface this whole thing I do actually really like the franchise, and have been a pretty big fan ever since I watched Markiplier play the first game when it was still a one night demo in 2014, so no one can say that I'm not a ""real fan"" for my opinion on the film. Since that is pretty much the only reasoning/defense I have seen from people about why this movie is good and why people who do not agree are ""wrong"". I have also been waiting for this movie ever since it was announced to be a thing almost an entire decade ago at this point, and I kept up to date with it through all its delays and cancellations and the prospect that it was never actually going to happen because Scott couldn't settle on a script and his announced ""retirement"" a couple years ago, but just because I waited so long for this movie and really do like the source material (up until help wanted, all the books are pretty good though) does not make the movie any better. While I am happy that it happened, it wasn't a good movie, it was incredibly mediocre at best, but it did have some cool moments.Another thing, oh my god is the FNAF fan base one of the most annoying things I've ever had the displeasure of being in a movie theater with, they just never shut up, everything that happened in the movie was like the most insane thing they've ever seen in their life they wouldn't stop talking and going ""ooooo"". I've never been surrounded by so many obnoxious incels at once before, it's like they've never been in a movie theater before and I wouldn't be surprised (iykwim). There's seriously no reason ever to get up and clap in the middle of a movie and start talking because you got a reference to something, just shut up and sit down, learn how to act around normal people.Now for the movie itself, it's seriously one of the worst movies I watched that came out this year, it wasn't bad in the typical ways movies are bad. It was just so insanely boring, the majority of the movie had absolutely nothing happening but man sleep and fight with his aunt for the custody of his sister, which is insane to put into a movie about robots possessed by little kids murdering people because they're being manipulated by the man who killed them. The only actual entertaining parts of the entire movie were all the references and Easter eggs that they put into it, and while I do find it cool and did appreciate those nods that is not enough for a whole hour and fifty minute long movie to be good. I enjoyed seeing the references and cameos and Easter eggs that were there but that's pretty much all it had other than a pretty decent start and a fun ending, the entire middle of the movie was just unnecessary and a snooze fest.The parts I did like were very spaced out and only lasted a few seconds because they weren't actually a part of the plot (other than my boy Matthew Lilard, he was amazing). Like the Matpat and Coryxkenshin cameos were awesome and made me smile, I'm glad that they got into the movie since they're such a big part of the fandom. I also liked the Easter eggs like the ""it's me"" appearing on the security monitor in the one scene, the whole ball pit thing being a reference to ""into the pit"", the hiding from Foxy in an arcade being similar to a sequence in ""the silver eyes"", the living tombstone song at the end, the 8-bit opening, the bite (which was kind of cool but it being entirely in half was goofy), and the whole ""I always come back"" quote (which I have a problem with ill get into in a minute) but that was all the film had. The story itself was lacking any substance and the characters were boring and bland. I know that they banked on the references and cameos bringing ""true fans"" into the theater who would defend the movie with their lives but those people are just blinded by their love for the franchise.Other than that, the only thing the movie had going for it was Matthew Lilard as Willy Afton, he slayed in that role for real. By a long shot the best part of the entire movie was his performance, especially at the end when he's in the spring Bonnie suit (which I do really like the design of the suit they nailed that and the rest of the costumes), but he only had like 10 minutes of screen time which really felt rushed, they totally could've had him play a bigger role in it and that would've made it much better in my opinion. I do have a problem with the infamous ""I always come back"" from him though, not that he said it weirdly which he did, but why did he say it at all (I know it was to get a reaction out of the fans because that's all the movie was) but it seriously doesn't make an ounce of sense for him to say that in that scenario. Like what is he even talking about, when he has come back before, what has he come back from, why is he coming back? It was super out of place and didn't mean anything in the context of the movie, they should've saved the line for when he actually CAME BACK in the sequel or even in the third movie because they're probably gonna kill him more than once it's kind of his thing. The rest of the acting was decent enough I guess, the little kids did an alright job for kid actors (except for the little girl she did a strange job), Josh Hutcherson did pretty good as Mike Schmidt, and Vanessa's character was pretty okay, she was like weirdly bipolar with how she treated them and how much she cared whether or not they got hurt or not. Like one second she'd be super friendly and the next she'd be threatening to shoot them, like girl pick a side (I know her dad is William Afton which was such a funky decision to make but she was still super back and forth on whether or not she was helping her dad or not). The actors who played the animatronics also did really good at portraying robots, so props to them.The changes they made to the lore as well weren't bad but just felt weird, like why make Vanessa Williams daughter? What's the point in doing that other than to make it different than the games. Why add these new (pretty boring) plot points/characters like Abby and Garret (and garret im pretty sure they're gonna try and make the Puppet which is eh). It just felt disjointed to market the movie as ""just for the fans who know all the lore and will understand and the references"" and then change up the lore.Another complaint about this movie is the fact that for a horror movie, it is probably the least scary horror movie I've ever watched, not just because it was pg-13 which would've been fine if they had just you know filled the movie with easy jumpscares, which is pretty much all the games are, but they didn't. For a movie based on a game franchise about getting jumpscared, the movie had like 5 jumpscares, and none of them were good, the only ones that were kind of unexpected were the gag ones they did with the toy balloon boy which is depressing. I didn't need the movie to be rated r and filled with blood and gore (it should've been just for the spring lock scene alone) but they didn't even take advantage of the ""horror"" they could've added. Which is so disappointing to me, they really could've done a lot more to make the movie better but just settled for mediocre with a ton of fan service because they knew it was going to make them a lot of money.I really wanted to love this movie, I loved the games and even the books for a large part of my childhood and had been waiting a long time to finally see a movie adaptation on the big screen, but sadly it was a real letdown for me. It just felt like they didn't care about making a good movie, but instead cared about how to get die hard lovers of their franchise to dump money into it and ignore how bland it is just because it has the I. P. attached to it. For a movie it's one of the most boring I've watched, with basically no substance to its story, and even as a FNAF movie it's still not that great. It's just amazingly alright, I can't hate it but I definitely can't love it. I hope they make it better with the sequel.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","averywilliams-79792","28 October 2023","The movie was expediently bad. Sure it had its positives, like the animatronics looked really good, and I liked the actor for Vanessa and Mike. But I stopped watching the last thirty minutes because im so confused and mad.First off the inside of the pizzeria was such a let down, it didn't have any of the iconic game elements, such as the drawings on the walls, the party tables, the telephone guy, and the backdrop for the stage that Freddy stood on. Secondly, what is going on with the plot? Who are Mike, Abby, and Garret, and when did they become important..? Along with the aunt, the babysitter, and the nervous lawyer?Not to mention the kills are cheaper than five below, it's one thing to have an off screen kill, but all of them besides the babysitter are off screen. In the game the security guard is killed with a jump scare, they could have added that to the movie, especially since the jump scares are such an important part of the games. The jump scares didn't need to be directly aimed at the camera like in game, but just a few jump scares, to help build the tension would've given the movie that scary sense.The whole movie was all over the place, and really cringy at times, like when they built the fort. Why would deadly animatronics build a HORRIBLE looking fort for some random girl thats not even apart of the lore? Not to mention the girls character completely sucked and just screamed ""look at me, im special! I talk to animatronics that kill people and they absolutely love me!! UwU!!""The special effects sucked, I've seen tik tok artists do better black eyes and tears. The movie lacked a ton of scary elements, shock factor, which is disappointing when they had multiple chances to add elements from the game but they didn't, which ie shocking because scott himself worked on the movie and made the games!","

But everything changes as the film progresses. The ending is completely epic. It doesn't include all aspects of the lore, which was impossible in a two-hour movie. I don't care what others say, for me it was a super good movie. It wasn't very horror, but hey, FNAF became so famous because of the story.The actors played quite well, especially Matthew Lillard. He knew what William Afton meant. Vanessa's death was kind of unexpected, honestly. And the comedy part of the movie was also good. Some complain that the comic part shouldn't have been there. Bro, even the games had some funny parts. In the end, my opinion, as with other games based movies, is that people complain too much. The movie pleased me beyond measure, and I'm a big old fan.","

The designs are cool and Michael Afton was a good character but should've gotten more screen time. While the designs were cool they brought in characters from other games. They brought in Vanesa who was really the only one, and the animatronics should've have gotten more screen time. They showed the same flash back like 10 times, the story was also a hot mess. Vanesa was poorly written, Their was a lot of talking during the movie, and for people who don't play the games had it rough. The people who don't play the games are probably wondering why would you were a suit that kills you, why are their two Freddy's and it may be tough for them. Foxy was the only one that was lore accurate and their wasn't much goor at all. Their was no screaming from the spring lock scene, no blood, it looked like he was busting a nut, and his fraise ""I always come back"" was cringe he only died once like shut your goofy up. I know they want the younger fans of the games to see it because the fanbase is mostly kids but the springlock scene was so PG. This movie was terrible. Trash Movie.","

When we went to see the New Exorcist we saw the trailer for Five Nights at Freddie's.I was immediately psyched. Her and I were like a Demonic Chuck e Cheese from Blumhouse. We we're extremely disappointed. If it was worse perhaps it could've been funny.I gave it a 4 purely for the Animatronic characters and premise. Otherwise the script was horrible. Some reviewers claim the rating of PG - 13 doomed the movie. More blood and gore would've saved it. Wrong a better script would've.2 better PG-13 movies this year we're Megan and the Conjuring. Better storytelling. In fact let's talk about what is scary? Not jump scares that's a cheap trick perhaps used once or twice. Suspense, the Unknown, tension these elements cause fear.For the younger or less knowledgeable fans of the genre watch ""Night of the Living Dead"", "" Alien"", even ""Signs"". Great scripts and stories and low on gore and violence all SCARY.","

I know the movie has some things that are part of the lore of the books and games, but they have zero coherence. I dont get how Scott could mess up the movie with that plot twist. Vanessa wasn't even a fetus when the springlocks scene happened. William had 3 kids, of which 2 of them for the springlocks moment were already dead. Mike Schrit wasn't William' s son, like WTF. The animatronic were just like the memes in the last part of the movie. Everything from this movie has no coherency.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","garodardavis-08913","26 October 2023","I have to admit... in an era where video game adaptations fail most of the time, I kept my expectations for this movie low on purpose.Despite this, a very small part of me was hoping this would be a character based drama/horror with a focus on the messed up story behind the Freddy's Fazbear's Pizzeria.Instead, it was a very mediocre movie that will likely not break any records as a video game adaptation.The Pros: Amazing looking Animatronics, great setting.Cons: Incredibly convoluted story with many missed opportunities, rushed ending, lack of horror, jumpscares don't work at all, PG-rating, poor decision making from characters due to a terribly written screenplay.As someone who is only familiar with FNAF on a surface level, this movie just didn't work for me.However, some fans might disagree, although even the most hardcore lore fans will have to admit that certain elements or parts of the movie just don't work.If they ever make a sequel, I just hope it's better than this.

The cast of human actors surprisingly isn't the biggest, but they all nail their roles perfectly. And the animatronics, let me tell you disney is shaking, cause they are super life like.The movie plays around with different ideas and pieces of the lore, and fits them in to tell a new story. As much as I love FNAF as a game series, making that all a movie would be a mess, So to scrap that and just give us the essentials, and then build on top of those essentials in new ways is great.I'll end it here but hardest recommendation ever.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jjfisherlfc","30 October 2023","I came into this movie during opening weekend with an open mind. I knew a bit about the five nights at freddys lore and played a few games but I'm not particularly a huge fan.I'll start with the positives, the visuals were very well done throughout the film. I found the cinematography to be the best part of this film. Another aspect I have to have credit to is the animatronic designs and the way they are presented on screen.The biggest problem I have with the film is the plot. I find that it was sequenced very poorly throughout the story. I didn't find myself interested in the story behind the main characters brother as I wasn't interested in him nor the rest of the characters. I found that my attention was focused on the next time I would see one of the animatronics. The characters were bland and uninteresting especially the police officer.The movie ends in a twist that, if the rest of the movie had been good, may have been surprising.My last problem is that the movie pays 0 homage to the video games that the movie was based on and I can't imagine how die hard fans of Fnaf feel about this lazy attempt of a blockbuster movie.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Elvis-Del-Valle","27 October 2023","Scott Cawthon's popular video game makes its big leap to the big screen thanks to the king of modern horror cinema Blumhouse. Making a film adaptation of Five Nights At Freddy's was really easy, since the video game is not complex at all. It's a pretty simple story that doesn't need much explanation and the movie does it well. Mike's trauma contributes enough to give mobility to the plot and manages to link it with the events of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The design of the animatronics is amazing, respecting the characters of the video game a lot. They look adorable and scary at the same time. Using practical effects was a great success instead of using digital effects and adding the retro style that Freddy Fazbear's Pizza has makes the film have an eighties feel. Also, one thing that is clear is that the animatronics are actually not as evil as they used to be painted. In fact, the film gives a good justification for the actions of the animatronics and relates quite a bit to the dark past of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Even the famous song that was composed by The Living Tombstone already gave a clear explanation in the lyrics. The video game has always been characterized by its jumpscares and the movie has few jumpscares, but the concept of Five Nights At Freddy's goes far beyond that. It's not exactly the kind of horror movie one would expect to see since it's pretty soft. It is more of a horror film aimed at a child audience that really works perfectly. The Five Nights At Freddy's video games were always aimed at children and adolescents and the fact that the film is aimed at that type of audience is a success. It is quite faithful to the source material and maintains the games' level of suspense. Five Nights At Freddy's is another great achievement for the world of video game adaptations and a nice movie to enjoy with the entire family. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","braydonwiswell","4 November 2023","Why is the rating in the 5's? It was pretty good! They stuck with the original lore of the animatronics being haunted from the children that were lured and murdered (I feel like a lot of people didn't understand the story to the original games)
Keep in mind, this is a horror movie directed towards teens, so it's not as gory as saw, but it had some good jump scares and creepiness to it. Being the game is an indie game and doesn't give the player a lot of freedom, they used the original lore and created a fun story out of it. Sure, it has flaws as every movie does, but I went in expecting the movie to be dog crap, but I actually really enjoyed it. Not perfect by any means, but it wasn't bad either. I plan on seeing it again!Advice? Watch it! Especially if you're a lover of the original game!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","khffx","1 November 2023","You know what was missing from the games? A 30 minute introduction of the protagonist showing in excruciating detail why he needs the job. I was worried, walking into the theater, it was going to be nonstop, homicidal, animatronic action. Luckily that's only a very small portion of the film. The real story is about a young man trying to raise his orphaned sister and overcome a tragic past. You might be mistaken, and think the villain is some sort of supernatural animatronic bear or an evil corporation that owns the arcade. Fortunately these are professional writers and producers. No, the real villain is his evil aunt. Not the murderous machines living in the decrepit arcade.. It's some woman and her lawyer. What a twist!I'm now about halfway through the movie. I really hate it. Like, before I could make light of it, but now I'm just disgusted.What I learned from this movie is childhood therapy is pointless. If you have a kid that's withdrawn, the best way to break them out of their shell is for them to see a mechanical monster kill their evil aunt and torture a crazy man in a bunny suit. You might think that would mess a kid up, but according FNAF lore it's really therapeutic.","

The acting was superb, Hutchinson obviously being the stand out but the others as well; I thought it was well written and those mechanical suits were insane! So well made, expressive, and interesting to watch. It was great they released the movie on streaming so I could watch after my shift. I'm a huge fan of horror movies, from old films to international ones, especially the avant garde - and I'd recommend this one to plenty of people. It's heartfelt, funny, and does a good job of making you like the characters and fear for their lives.I cracked up laughing the first night when Mike just goes to sleep, I feel like I would have done the same working a (supposedly) boring night shift. There's a lot of scenes that I never expected but was pleasantly surprised by, like the fort scene. And Springtrap/William Afton's arrival had me gasp, even though I had known it was coming it was still well done!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","derekrice-00312","27 November 2023","This film is primarily made for the FNAF fans. The animatronics, the characters, and basic lore of the game franchise are done justice in this film and so much is left unanswered for sequels. Personally, I have only played the first game and looked up videos explaining the lore and the fan fiction. And this film met my expectations exactly! It even had good cameo appearances of YouTubers who became big from playing the games on their channels (though I won't mention them).I admit, there are plot holes and dumb decisions made in this film but in all honesty, the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise has been pretty well known for being campy and cheesy. In fact, that is the basis of each game's gameplay mechanics with the limited power and unsafe demeanor of Fazbear Entertainment's locations. Overall, this film is a must-see for fans of Five Nights at Freddy's.","

In game to film adaptations I usually tend to be sceptical about how good it will turn out. I was also unsure about how Josh would do in the lead role, but I was wonderfully surprised- he did a stellar performance. The animatronics were what I was most excited about and I'm blown away by how great they looked on screen. It was so hard to remind myself that the animatronics were real puppets because they looked so good. There's not a lot of practical effects in movies anymore, most things like that are just CGI now. The movie blew my expectations out of the water. I've watched it multiple times now and love it more each time.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","magicbeamsamara","27 October 2023","The film, based on the plot of a computer game, is a mixture of a children's toy and animatronic costumes in which the extras are located. However, all this looks too exaggerated and absurd. The main character, although he has suffered a tragic loss, does not have a pronounced personality, which leads to his confused and hypo-optimistic behavior throughout the film. Originally intended for a teenage audience, the film contains violent scenes that make it unacceptable for viewing for this age group. On the other hand, it is of no interest to adult viewers, because it is built on the principle of ghosts and lacks logical coherence of what is happening. The actions of the extras in animatronic beast costumes are very slow, but when the dolls become invisible, they suddenly acquire supernatural speed and the ability to manipulate door locks. I can safely advise you to refrain from watching this movie, because it can seriously disturb your mental state. At the same time, it is worth recognizing that its cinematic component is competently executed.","

Yes, lack of gore to get a PG13 makes $$ sense. Movies are here to make money, it's a business like anything else and they need to recoup their losses, and expanding the age tp see a movie does just that.Rating a movie low because you don't know the background? Dumb.This movie was fun, delved into serious territory with child kidnapping and had some fun jump scares. For an app game to be made into this is pretty good. It's a fun movie that on the surface you don't have to think too hard, but has layers to it that you can pull back if you want to read more into it. It did well without all the gore, and if they make an R rated version great, but not necessary.Spoiles:
Only gripe was knowing who the bad guy was right away. But the fort building scene was so cute. Solid fun!","

I am extremely disappointed that they even spent money making this movie.All the character's actions and dialogue just felt very cheap, I could not follow.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","Coventry","20 November 2023","Rarely ever before, two people felt more awkward and uncomfortable when walking into a movie theater... Yours truly, 42-year-old male, went to see ""Five Nights at Freddy's with his 14-year-old son. He's an avid gamer and I'm an 80s horror movie fanatic, so we saw this as a rare opportunity to bond. I felt incredibly old and out of place when noticing the theater was chock-full of loud teenagers, and my son probably felt deeply embarrassed because he was the only teenager accompanied by a parent.""Five Nights at Freddy's"" reminded me of a silly Nicolas Cage movie that I watched recently, named ""Willy's Wonderland"". That film is a blatant rip-off of the Freddy's videogame, apparently, but it came out 2 years before this 'adaptation'. Well, in that case I can only state it's stupid of the game's rights owners to wait with their own film-version for such a long time. Of course someone else is going to steal your idea of giant animatronics killer-puppets, especially when Nic ""quick paycheck"" is involved!The film itself is a combo of good and bad, although mostly bad if I'm honest. The script is an incoherent and implausible mess. With ""implausible"", I'm not even referring to the homicidal puppets, but to the background story of young protagonist Mike. Whilst battling to keep custody over his much younger sister, Mike reluctantly accepts a job as nightwatchman in an abandoned 80s-themed pizzeria and gaming hall. He uses his job as a ""watcher"" to sleep and re-enact the recurring dream in which he hopes to recognize the face of the man who kidnapped his kid brother more than a decade ago. That doesn't make any sense, I know, but obviously Mike's trauma somehow needs to be linked to the location where he spends his nights. Giant Freddy's mascots come to life at night and kill perpetrators, but the real monster is of flesh and blood.But let's keep things positive also, because - after all - there are far worse ways to spend two hours of your life. Any 2023 horror film that takes the effort to work with old-fashioned animatronic effects instead of digitalized rubbish and green screens deserves a word of praise, especially when the jolly creatures are made by a bunch of people known as ""Jim Henson's Creature Shop"".","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","bradenewee","28 October 2023","It's unlikely you'll ever see something this incompetent, boring and slow be so highly regarded by an army of devoted online fans again - until the sequel is made at least. It's made for fans to do the Leonardo pointing meme at the screen for the rote references/ cameos and nothing more.Such is the fan power to thrust a ""horror"" adaptation that is so disinterested in trying to use what made the first game a viral sensation - possessed animatronics hunting and jump-scaring an almost helpless security guard - in favour of tedious amounts of justification for nonsensical plot points and lore exposition dumps that drag the pacing to a crawl. None of the twists surprise, all heavily predictable or meaningless (or entirely expected by lore gurus) while every jumpscare attempt pales in comparison the games. Freddy and co might be impressive practical recreations but they're utterly stiff when visible, only actually able to attack when off-screen which leads to an unintentionally hilarious dream sequence. They just don't do much given their capabilities, and the cupcake gag becomes overplayed. There didn't need to be gore to be scary - just good directing, writing, staging and sound, none of which is here.Performance wise, only Mathew Lillard does anything to entertain the absurd (it always has been, just admit it) premise with a bit of hammy acting for the very few short minutes he's there. The rest are mostly monotone or just poor; I never understood why Abby hated her aunt so much and would prefer her disinterested brother Mike (a sleepy Josh Hutcherson), other than the sloppy writing just making her a greedy Karen who the script forgets entirely. The actress for Abby has the worst line reads of the lot and never looks frightened, while the police officer spouts exposition and becomes friends with Mike for no good reason at all.As for that directing, the individual shots and sets out of context look fine - altogether however it's a mess, as if she wasn't confident about how certain moments would turn out and just shot it from tons of different angles for no reason with mostly poor lighting. Tonally the film shifts from attempted horror to drama, back into attempted horror, drama again, then an abrupt light hearted family comedy before shifting gears towards drama and poorly executed horror final act. That resolution to the conflict... it's just plain stupid. If only you could draw pictures in the games, or carry a taser.But none of this matters to anyone who has an emotional investment in the reception of this film. They've waited a long time after plenty of games, let's plays and lore videos to feast on, and they'll be damned if this film isn't an 11/10. Understanding Scott's convoluted lore doesn't make this better - only lowering your quality standards and being biased towards the IP will.","

But when I finally saw it today, I thought 'Wow! What a disaster!'Firstly, FNAF has a really interesting and deep lore, in this movie however, the main points of the plot were absent and everything else was mixed up (like what was Vanessa doing there?? Why was William Afton her father??) and felt really rushed. Also FNAF is a tragic story, but somehow there was a happy ending in the movie for everyone? Just why?? Not everything has to have a happy ending.Secondly, I, personally, wanted this movie to be scary, which could've been achieved even with PG-13 rating, but animatronics didn't seem creppy or unsettling at all, like they should have. On the contrary, they looked very sweet and friendly.To conclude I would like to say that this movie was a big waste of time and I recommend watching some letsplays on youtube, they are much better than this cinematic rubbish.","

They're actually fun, and scary. But this, isn't. It tries to walk a line between a kids movie and a horror movie, but it just seems silly the whole way through. It also completely defeats the purpose how Josh Hutcherson's character keeps leaving the room or falling asleep or PLAYING WITH THE ANIMATRONICS. The movie feels like a joke, but it's going to do what it needs to do, make some money before Halloween is over. For a younger audience, maybe it's fun, but the most it will ever be is a movie some parents turn on in the background at a Halloween party.","

That's what makes FNAF and its lore so interesting, it's mystery and subtle details about what happened in the pizzeria, that fear of unknown.

Visually, it's amazing! Animatronics looked perfect, set design was flawless and the actors gave it there all but the writing really made everything fall flat. I'm usually easy to scare (and I enjoy it) but I didn't feel that horror genre excitement or suspense. The jump-scares were weak and not one person in the audience seemed surprised by any of them. I was pretty disappointed because I was excited and ready to scream. Even if the scares were good, the story was a bit boring. The cameo was neat but that was about it. Overall I'm just sad to see something that had so much potential fall so flat, especially with how good the animatronics and costumes looked.

I used to talk to friends about each game and watch countless hours of theory videos. I even remember coming back from school each day, holding my breath when I refreshed the website showing sneak peaks of the next game.The models of the animatronics were superb, they were nearly perfect. The only complaint I have is how their eyes just glowed a lame hue of orange whenever they got mad, which does not compare to the hollow white dots of the exoskeleton beneath that you'd constantly see in the franchise.The story and characters were underwhelming. Not at one point throughout the movie did I feel like I genuinely cared about any of it, even though I tried to. There was no suspense, horror or fun. I even started to doze off near the end.Overall, I do think that any fan of the franchise should give this movie a go, just for the sake of viewing more content.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","coopanator","30 November 2023","Let's start with the bad. The acting sucked but I blame that more on the poor writing. The script was ridiculous and the story was even worse. The death scenes were lame as hell, I guess to keep it of-13. The only thing this movie has going for it is the costumes.Now going into spoilers...If you have followed the fnaf lore, as I have for some stupid reason, you will recognize most of the characters. They make you believe that we are following Micheal Afton and his sister who later turns into baby. He takes the security job, which makes no sense in the context of the movie btw, and Vanessa is introduced out of nowhere flirting hard. The animatronics only ever lightly attack Mike while he is sleeping and he doesn't even know they are alive until 3 nights of sleeping there. There is no classic fnaf gameplay moment to be had. Phone guy turns out to be afton who is also Vanessa's father who stabs her. I couldn't help but laugh at that scene. Mike is revealed to be Mike Schmidt which was pretty lame. I could go on about how bad this movie was but I'm done wasting my time on it. The timelines don't seem to match up with the games so I assume it's not canon. Fnaf lore has always kinda sucked anyway.","

It's basically a horror movie for 12 year olds.Sadly, with the film failing to scare there just isn't anything very motivating about it outside of nice set / costume design -- the plot is very straightforward with ""twists"" you can predict 30 minutes ahead of time and the acting is just passable.Overall it isn't irredeemable but there's nothing that makes it stand out outside of its ties to a popular video game franchise.

I wasn't much of a FNAF fan, I always thought it was overrated. That being said, animatronics had a lot of character to them, which I appreciated. They all had their own personalities and actions and in turn, that made them more distinctive than the animatronics in WW.The negatives were Mike. He isn't awful but he was sort of bland. I'm not sure if it's because he is the silent protagonist in the first game so if you like more of a blank slate character, then he fits. Vanessa deserved to be stabbed for her actions to protect her serial killer father (Matthew Lillard). Lillard as Afton was brilliant and I'm happy he was finally getting another killer role, considering he last did it in Scream from 1996.FNAF did have its high points but it didn't do much overall for me. Honestly... Willy's Wonderland did ""killer animatronics"" better.","

Overall her character was confusing and didn't add much to the story? Very frustrating. As for the animatronics I don't understand why spring trap was the only character designed with the classic black eyes we all see in the games. Yes people say red eyes are canon but in the games, these characters are scary because of their eyes and the overall concept. There were so many things included or just not included in the movie lore wise. Honestly, I wasted my time.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","desertrose0601-690-503760","28 October 2023","I've never played the game and I loved this. Don't listen to the haters. This was a wonderful story with superb acting. I was riveted the entire time. Nothing about this movie was what I expected and I'm completely fine with that. It was honestly way better than I expected.It was giving me retro, although I'm not sure it ever said when this movie took place. If I had to guess, I'd say probably early 2000's. Great atmosphere overall.I'd recommend for older kids and up. It's not really a kid's movie but r here's nothing super duper scary. It's got some jump scares and a spooky vibe. Kinda gave me Gremlins vibes, just less scary than that. I'd definitely watch this again.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","zsammy-11675","4 November 2023","For a FNAF movie, this is definitely decent. Acting is good and I feel like the overall concept fit Well. However, I feel there were some bad scenes which were way too slow. There wasn't really ant scary moments, and i didnt really Get any jumpscares. Without going to much in detail, I think the character development was way to bad for a 2 hour movie. If they manager to Get better character development, I would definitely give this movie a 7+ rating. Just some overall mistakes, making it end up as a 5. In short terms = a decent movie, but u wouldn't miss much if u didn't have time to watch it!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","sloncarvuca","27 October 2023","Pros: Animatronics are amazing, their movement and design is the best thing about the movie, design team really took their time with them. If you wanna see the movie just for animatronics you won't be dissappointed. Movie keeps fans in mind, there are some cameos and they showed parts of the FNAF lore that fans would be most interested in. Special and practical effects look really good too.Cons: Overall direction is not good, they wanted to give a whole movie this hollywood look with many colorful lights that envoke 80s feel. Now it does look pretty but it doesn't stay faithful to the original material. Story is too simple and straight forward, if you are familiar with the franchise you already know what's going to happen. Acting is kinda dull at times too. But I gotta say rating is what ruins the movie. Because it's PG-13 a lot of violent and bloody scenes took place off screen or in the dark I just wish we got more stuff going on beacuse that's the entire point of FNAF.Overall even tho it's not that great and it falls flat I would still recommend people to see it. It is entertaining at times. It's so nice to see the franchise come to life considering everything that was going on and how long it took to finally make FNAF movie. I just wonder if it might bave been better in someone else's hands.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","deezjohn","26 October 2023","When I came into the theater I was so excited to watch the movie (9 years of waiting). The movie started and it was great so far but then 1 hour of lore mixing hell started. It wasn't matching up with the original lore and when I seen the animatronics dancing and playing with Abby I was sure at the wrong movie. I couldn't believe how bad the lore was. But the end was good. Spring lock scene (it was alright), end credits (really good). And the acting was good don't get me wrong but it was just not enough. Overall in my opinion I will give the movie 3/10. I was expecting much more for this movie.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","vivekkondellaws","25 October 2023","Honestly, I did know somewhat a bit about the FNAF game before I saw the movie, going in I didnt expect much because obviously it is made after a game, thus its hard to tell if its going to be good. The atmosphere in my cinema was rowdy, half of the people going to see the film because of the game and the other half as a joke. The film overall had a weak plot, the acting was abismal and it was a hard watch without some jokes in between. That said though, the graphics were great and it will please those who are fans of the game, there are some special apperances and im sure that long fans of the film will appreciate it. My main takeaways are really:
1. Definitely watch if you are a big fan of FNAF, there are special appearances and it will fill you with interesting content
2. If you dont know anything about FNAF, DONT GO! If you want to see a good movie go to Killers of the Flower Moon instead, unless you enjoy sub par horror (which wasnt all too scary) I wouldnt go!That said, if you enjoy fnaf then eat your heart out with this one.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","williamsjaelyn","3 November 2023","So disappointed, I waited so long for... I'm not sure what exactly. Firstly, the acting was a bit off in some places so it was hard to enjoy. Secondly, the sister was so extremely annoying that it was almost unbearable to watch. If the acting wasn't enough, the plot quickly became predictable and I knew exactly what was going to happen before, during and after the twist. I expected so much more from this movie and was left very underwhelmed. I will say that the graphics were very well done and it was visually pleasing to look at, but the acting and plot were terrible. Also, a few useless characters thrown in there as well.","

I've been in the FNAF fandom for years now and I've been waiting for this movie for so long, only to be met with nothing, but poor pacing (introducing around 4 characters in the first 40-50 minutes), no gore or horror, wholesomeness while the movie is supposed to be scary, only one jumpscare and so on.The movie also had good scenes where I actually had hope, like the showing of Springtrap, only to be met with a character that I was just not expecting at all.I am just so truly disappointed I waited approximately 6-7 years only to be met with this bland movie.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","thenadsbro","30 October 2023","Does not fit with the character lore like the Afton family and the age ruined it. It should have stick with lore instead of a alternate reality of Five Nights at Freddy's. At least could have William Afton as the murderer in it. Movie is just like any other rip off version of Five Nights at Freddy's. Not recommended at all. Acting is fine so far but for the animatronics costumes with cast inside, it is difficult for them to act like an animatronics. I understand that the writers was given script and can't make changes to it at all. Should have at least some references to the original lore of Five Nights at Freddy's.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","alonsoprogamer","27 October 2023","Totally incredible... a movie made entirely for fans and non-fans.The story is well developed and there are no gaps in the script or conveniences that ruin the continuity of the film. As for the jumpscares, they are not bad, obviously there are but they are not ridiculous and they are well done, the same as with the 'gore'. The humor, as always, is objective but it is not childish at all and can make you at least smile in those scenes. The acting is quite good, as is the cast, everyone is well chosen and good work is evident from each actor. And the villain... is pure perfection, you can see his perverse way of being when he unmasks himself in front of the entire public and shows his true self.Like any movie based on a popular video game, there is fan service, but in this case I don't find it poorly placed or forced. On the contrary, every detail is well placed and has a meaning, even if it is something minimal.Finally, if you are a big fan of the saga, you will love it completely and you will leave the cinema satisfied. And if you're not, I'm sure you'll find it a decent horror movie.Thanks Blumhouse and Scott, it was worth waiting so many years. <3.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","remusutul","16 December 2023","The movie was actually fun to watch, i loved the cameos. The story was really nice, i think it would be better if it was from the original series. But still it was very interesting. I loved Abby's and Mike's brother and sister relationship. I loved the fact that Mathew Lillard played William Afton, and speaking of William, I loved that they keeped his name, I think that the robbers scene could be more gory. The music was really beautiful. The Newton Brothers did a really good job. I loved the fact that they added Sparky and Shadow Freddy, as an easter egg. The movie caught me off guard at the bite of 00 scene. There was some commedy added there, horror, thriller, and a little bit of gore. I really loved the fact that Scott added a lot of things in the movie that we wanted, as the bite of 87(kinda) springlock scene, I always come back, easter eggs, cameos and many others, I don't understand why people gave this movie a really low rating, I think that it was review bombed. Anyways go watch the movie if you didn't saw it, belive me you will not regret, cya!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","ILikeMoviesandtvorg","28 October 2023","As a big fan of the games, This movie was amazing. From the cinematography to pretty much everything. First, the plot was pretty good. For people not knowing, in the games the animatronics have been known to be bad around adults, as stated in fnaf 2. But that story was great cause in the games there's a minigame just like the ending. For the fans they have delivered very well and also the experience of watching it in a movie theater made it so much better. Personally, more jumpscares would have been great because it's what the games are all about. But if you are a fan of the games this movie would be amazing and if you have never heard of five nights at Freddy's, I recommend you play some of the games and then go back to the movie because you need some knowledge from the games. So if you think the movie was more boring since you dont know much of the story, i recommend you watch youtube videos of it and then come back to it because it would be so much better. But yea one of the best expieriences i have ever had in a movie theater and it was a 10/10 movie would defenitely come back to it 100%.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","jollyfilmsnv","27 October 2023","At first, I was a little worried that this movie was going to be treated like a cheep horror flick. But the movie played out much like one of Scott Cawthons books. The aesthetic was exactly what I imagined the books to be and I was so delighted to see that in the movie. I was also surprised and super happy about how we explored the animatronics childish side. That was always something in the fandom that I liked seeing. I never saw it in the actual games. But this just showed how well these people knew their fans!! Also the soundtrack was pretty flippin awesome! The main theme was perfect for the franchise. I also really loved what they did with the end credits. I also loved the teaser for Fnaf 2 at the end with the minigame voice. I loved the casting for this movie. I also also loved the animatronics. They looked way too perfect!! The restaurant too!! Also also also, I loved the cameos from YouTubers in the movie. There was also a reference to the dream theory in the movie. That made me chuckle. I also also also ALSO loved how the movie can stand as its own thing. It was all so perfectly wrapped up so that I could just show anyone the movie and they'd know what the franchise is like. Scott and the rest of the team did above and beyond for this movie. I can confidently say that this is my new favorite horror movie by a long shot!!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","RightOnDaddio","28 October 2023","I really knew absolutely next to zero about Five Nights at Freddy's when I bought a ticket and walked into the theater.Oh sure, I mean, just from sheer pop culture exposure I gathered as much through the years that it's about an old pizza place like a Chuck E. Cheese or whatever and the animatronic animals are all alive or something to that extent.But that's it.That's all I knew.I loved those pizza places back in the early 80's and I love scary movies and the trailer for this looked decent enough for me to give it two hours of my life.I wasn't disappointed.Nor was I lost or out of place with the story here.It's a good 2023 horror flick.But it's not for young kids. At all.At least not those under ten or eleven that aren't familiar with 5NAF themselves.The origin of the characters, that is, the robots it's somewhat terrifying and morbid.I'd say for teens on up this is a good movie for the season.I enjoyed several things about Five Nights.The performances by all the adult leads are commendable: Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard and Mary Stuart Masterson.I also enjoyed Elizabeth Lail as Vanessa and jams by The Romantics!Love The Romantics!This movie is a tad long but not too bad. It could've knocked off a couple of nights and lost nothing.So, if you're in your fifties or older and the only Freddy you know around this time of year is a guy with skin issues who wears a red and green striped sweater, then maybe get hip to this new Freddy on the block.It's okay if you have no idea when you get your ticket.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","fdqroadie","27 October 2023","I went in with an open mind and very low expectations and I still ended up disappointed.The games were known for having an overall creepy and disturbing atmosphere with effective jumpscares. This movie had none of the unease, none of the creepiness, none of the undertones. It relied olely on jumpscares and those weren't very good. They were tame, predictable and many seemed forced.None of the characters were likable, the kid was annoying and insufferable. The cameos were cringey and obviously not well acted since it was done by people who aren't actors and the story is very slow paced and basically lacking anything scary 90% of the times.I could have ignored all that if the plot had been the classic survive the 5 nights with murderous animatronics, but the majority of the movie didn't even focus on the nights in the restaurant.And the times we did see horror elements, they were mostly implied or just not scary at all. It was a full theater, the majority of the audience were kids aged 13-15 and not a single time did anyone scream or jump in their seat. Which is a very bad sign for horror.The movie feels like an entirely different story that was rewritten to fit the FNAF theme. The animatronics looked great, but their movements looked like humans in fursuits.The only redeeming quality of the movie is Matthew Lillard's acting. He did an amazing job!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","dr_lager","15 November 2023","I watched this without knowing anything about the videogame series except that the kids all love the concept of it, and played it somewhat. Those kids are teens now, and still mostly love the idea of FNAF, including all the cultural stuff outside the games.So, I went to the movies on a Tuesday night with low expectations, except I'd seen the generally poor reviews.It's true that the acting is pretty poor and mostly wooden. The dialogue is often ridiculously inane and the ending is beyond predictable. But, that all fits with this kind of movie. It's mild schlock horror, mostly safe for kids, the story drags you along despite yourself, and with a box of popcorn by your side it makes for a decent night out. I'm glad I saw it on the big screen - it made me stick through the whole thing, and I'm glad I did.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","psuedonights","28 October 2023","This movie was an absolute let down given the absurd amount of time it has been in production. The movie does not follow the title it is meant to adapt in any note able capacity. In all fairness, I do not think an adaptation has to be beat for beat, and I am all for changes to existing content so as to not be alienating to new comers. With that being said, the movie is very clearly made for existing fans, but pays little mind to them in it's story telling. I can say with 100% certainty that anyone with no context of prior material would be lost to anything that was going on.I and all my long term obsessions with the games was lost for a good chunk of it myself. The only redeeming qualities about the film were the fantastic works by the Jim Henson company on the animatronics, the set design, and the inclusion of noteable music as a nod to fans without shameless and out of place cameos. I feel many of the actors' performances suffered greatly from poor direction, so I can't fault them to much. The film would've benefited greatly from an R rating, it's attempts to balance two audiences were clearly not placed in the right hands, and any gorey scenes felt like something you'd find in Birdemic.The writers also appeared to be unwilling to stick to a tone, jumping between family friendly hallmark shenanigans and saw traps. Not to say this can't be done well, it can, but it wasn't. At the very least, it was a somewhat enjoyable watch. In the relm of so-bad-its-good through parts, and a complete drag through others. For just over an hour and a half movie, Avatar (the blue people one) feels shorter.Overall, it's terrible. A pretty shameless cash-grab through the majority, with a few moments of release that at least pulled a laugh or hype here and there. Not worth paying to see in theater, but if you're curious there is always peacock. TLDR.. it's bad. Sorry to all my fellow FNAF kids who were waiting for this one.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","vwhkrgwp","28 October 2023","Definitely a good movie but wasn't necessarily as horrifying as it could have been but that should have been expected with it being mainly aimed at a younger audience. The overall story though was definitely satisfying and tied very well with what is already established in existing media relating to the series, the main character, Mike, definitely has his issues but he is found redeemable through a number of ways. The animatronics are portrayed very well and the children that inhabit them are portrayed in the movie very respectfully to the source material. The movie could have had more visceral content but what it did do, it did well, even with staying within the film's PG-13 rating.","

The game so idk what people expected from a $20 million budget film. It's funny how people waited 8 years to see this movie just to give it a bad review. I loved all the work they put into it like the animatronics and the restaurant. They used actual objects instead of CGI to make it look more real instead fake.

"Five Nights at Freddy's","sircmichaels-927-116489","28 October 2023","I recently watched this film with my 8-year-old, who is slightly younger than its intended audience. While the movie echoes well-loved gateway horror films like NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS and BEETLEJUICE, it sets itself apart with a layer of classic horror intensity, making it more visceral than its counterparts.Crafted with a younger audience in mind, the film presents a story that's squeamish, inventive, and morally nuanced. It might appeal more to younger viewers, but adults might find it a tad niche.What sets it apart is its emphasis on story over mere jump scares. The film blends psychological horror with creatively unsettling animatronic kills.While certain scenes push the envelope, the film's inclination to tackle darker themes is evident. Even when the animatronics enact gruesome deaths, there's an underlying sense that the victims, given their own dubious moral standings, arguably had it coming.In its execution, the movie steers clear of clichés. Taking a page from WORLD WAR Z, it proves that effective horror isn't solely about gore. The performances are robust, the characters are fleshed out, and despite a somewhat intricate plot, it remains accessible.While familiarity with the game that inspired the movie can add layers to the viewing experience, it's by no means a prerequisite. The film stands firmly on its own, offering closure yet hinting at the possibility of sequels.The exemplary quality of the animatronics underscores the significant effort and budget allocated to the production. This film doesn't just cater to a younger audience; it redefines horror for them, an approach I find commendable.For adults seeking traditional horror thrills, this might fall short. Yet, it carves a promising path for youth-focused horror films. It captivated my child, and that's a resounding success in my view.","

If the target audience would've been more for late teens-adult like the video game it could have been a great horror film, instead it was a very clean, kind of family friendly (except some gory parts) scary movie. The story line was kind of stupid and hard to follow at times. There is a lingering question throughout that never gets answered, and characters that never get closure in the story. The movie moved very slow but when there was action it was good action. A couple of good jump scares. Just didn't live up to my expectations when compared to the VR video game.","

As its going to be a trilogy, it makes sense that the first movies plot was kinda left in shadows to be seen. As it has been in the games and in the books.I might add that if someone who came to see it solely based on the games might not know or forget what from the animatronics came to life, they might think the movie was too boring or not scary enough on some parts.Animation, music, animatronics and the ambience was made really well and my exitement stayed all the way to the credits and a bit after it.It was such a pleasure to see my childhood horrors on the screen and ""alive"".I cant wait to see the rest!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","ipekkucukerdogan","28 October 2023","(spoilers)not only did it not follow the plot, the addition of characters from separate games that have never interacted with each other not only made the movie less worthwhile but also boring af. I think all the go fans of the franchise like me would agree that the crossover between security breach characters and what seems to be the original final 1 movie was unnecessary. The fan service felt like an excuse and somewhat an attempt to cover up the many plot holes and confusing parts this movie has that do not go along with the actual lore of the game. I was excited from the start as the first jumpscare set a great atmosphere and some expectations. However, as the movie progress, it made less and less sense (not because it's a bad movie, because it is a rather poor adaptation to such an iconic game). Like, come on, supposed William Afton taking his mask off revealing himself and being the guy who hired mike and also Vanessa's father???? The acting from the actors of Vanessa and mike was great, don't get me wrong--I think they hired the right people for the job, but it's the script that is entirely off. It is a rather difficult job to fit so much lore and so many details in chronological order into one movie anyway, but adding random things just for the sake of creating a movie at the end just makes the movie lose its initial purpose, which is the way it's meant to be an adaptation of the game. The graphics were better than I expected, the animatronics were decent--obviously could be more elevated by creating that dark and truly bone-chilling aesthetics of the first game, but that's fine. One aspect that turned this movie from horror, which I believe what we all experienced as kids playing this game, to a children's movie, was how we constantly saw the animatronics move. The entire scare factor of the games comes from the anticipation of a jumpscare and never knowing where the animatronics are. Not seeing them move makes the games, especially the first three (and I guess somewhat the forth one too) so scary. The animatronics becoming abby's friend? Making a fort with her? Mike so easily figuring out and coming to terms with how the animatronics are possessed by ghost children? Like what...the pathetic excuse of a wrap up in the end was even more saddening. In the final games, there's no sort of 'ending'. The lore is so deep that there's almost no incentive anymore--hence it is extremely difficult to convey the events of the game in the form of a movie. Perhaps if they took the documentary/found-footage route, it would be a much more interesting and at least accurate to the events of the game. This way, they wouldn't feel the need to 'wrap up' and show everyone having a great time and get their happy ending, since no such thing really happens in the games. There'd be no need to adopt the usual intro-build up-climax-conclusion format that a fictional movie has, had they used a slightly different approach. They could even take inspiration from those fnaf vhs tapes you see on YouTube.I've waited a decade for this movie, and for me it just felt rushed and that perhaps, all the hype went to the producer's heads or something that they thought adding in just anything as long as they had fan service and many references would be acceptable. Disappointed, to say the least.Yes, they've made a movie. Great. But this definitely isn't something I'll be calling 'THE fnaf movie', nor is it something that will go down in the history books of the fnaf franchise or something. It's funny how it feels like Scott was barely involved in the scripting of this. I'm assuming he just had to be there since he...well...made the game. And in a way it is nice to finally get what we've been wanting for this entire time.Still, it did not live up to the expectations (and was even worse than I expected).","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","briannabuckner-51100","28 October 2023","I've been waiting years for this and I am NOT disappointed. The story is different than the games but it gives new opportunity for theorizing like how in this story Vanessa is the afton kid. And there are many moments that make you so excited and remember the games like foxy singing his little tune, the ""I always come back"" (which when I saw it had the theater SCREAMING and cheering), the way Vanessa introduces herself. And then the MatPat cameo is so exciting too because he is so invested in fnaf and it made me and my friends really excited. There is a story similar to the games but so different at the same time, there is nostalgia that doesn't make you feel like it's a lot, it provides new material for theories, something new for fans to enjoy, and had enough gore to make it scary but still got to be pg-13. There is also parts that make you remember the games and things that happen that are so bad but all you can do is laugh or jump in your seat because you know the games and you know what will happen so all you can do is gasp and laugh. There is also just normal humor in the film like the balloon boy just popping up to scare people which was really funny. I'm giving this a 10/10 because it was a really nice change and different from the normal story and let fans relive these game moments in excitement. Honestly I know some people thought this movie was dumb, childish, and didn't have a good story, but I think it provided everything it needed to and I had an amazing time watching it.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","GayDingo","27 October 2023","Before I heard the news of the Five Nights at Freddy's movie, my awareness of the franchise was quite little. Though the games intrigued me, I refrained from diving into the games due to some past trauma that made it difficult for me to enjoy horror. Nevertheless, I enjoyed delving into the game's lore, immersing myself in its complex mildly incoherent narrative.In preparation for the movie, I decided to watch the video titled ""Five Nights at Freddy's Lore in Only 8:47:38 Complete History, Timeline Before the Movie #Fnaf."" This proved to be a great asset, equipping me with the knowledge needed to appreciate the film. It allowed me to grasp the myriad references, comprehend the profound impacts of the reveals, and stay engaged with the non-stop plot.The film itself is filled with intricate plotlines and rich lore. What stood out to me was the meticulous attention to detail, particularly in the faithful recreation of the security room from the game. As I followed the story, it became evident that the final revelation was somewhat predictable, yet incredibly satisfying.One of the most endearing aspects of the movie was the animatronics. They were so cute and cuddly! I just wanted to give all of them a nice warm (probably cold lol) hug. I already had the expectation that these animatronics weren't necessarily the ""bad guys,"" which made it easier for me to watch the movie. Horror and tension typically triger me, evoking traumatic memories, so I often resort to covering my eyes and ears during such scenes. However, this film presented a unique opportunity, as it was essentially a horror experience tailored for a younger audience, hence the absence of excessive gore. Miraculously, I only had to shield my eyes during two scenes, a feat I consider remarkable.For context, when I watched ""The Nun"" in theaters, I practically hid my face and wore headphones for the grand majority of the film, overwhelmed by its horror. Similarly, during ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,"" I couldn't endure a significant portion of the scenes and ended up covering my eyes for about 40% of the movie. This movie, however, offered a glimmer of hope that I could eventually watch horror films without succumbing to triggers.In sum, my experience with the Five Nights at Freddy's movie was an absolute delight. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and I'm left hoping for sequels in this universe!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","geno-young","28 October 2023","I'll start by saying this, THANK GOD for streaming because if I actually paid serious money at a theater to see this thing, I'd be pissed. First of all, I want to give hats off to the cast. I think they were great and played their rolls to the best of their abilities. The problem here wasn't the cast or the effects, ONCE AGAIN it was the SCREENWRITING falling short and missing the mark. Blumhouse use to be a reliable Horror juggernaut for a decade or so, but they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel in the writing department. If it isn't the likes of David Gordon Green screwing up the last two ""Halloween"" movies, it's this dreck. I will say, the first 45 minutes were promising and I had high hopes, but the second half of the movie was simply confusing and downright weird. The countless confusing dream sequences paired with poor character development made for a very bizarre first watch. It even put me to sleep at one point. After I finished the movie, I had to go back and rewatch certain parts to make sense of what I saw and didn't understand the first time. Almost more than anything, aside from all of the plot problems, the film lacked any true scares. Having a PG-13 rating is NO excuse, the first two ""Insidious"" movies proved that. The movie wasn't scary one bit and I'm still trying to figure out that little statue ""jump scare"" that occurred no less than three times.It just didn't do it for me, and I went into it with an open mind, having seen ZERO promos through and through and without reading a single review. I was expecting to like it, but it got in its own way, just like most recent Blumhouse ventures...SMH.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","hamsto","31 October 2023","Let's talk about good things first:
Animatronics looked really amazing and real, they did a great job with them, cast is a bingo, cinematography and design is really nice, the lore was made pretty good (even tho it felt like it was rushed at the end)
Now let's talk about some things that I personally didn't like (just my opinions):
The movie lacked the point of the fnaf games and that is having a jumpscares. I feel like that was the really important thing too because that's the reason why fnaf is popular not only because of the lore but because of it's horror elements. The movie lacked that a lot. I guess there were myb 2 ""jumpscares"" which didn't even scare me. One thing that I really hoped that they would do is actually make it like a game where Mike needs to survive 5 days, losing his sanity, making sure he doesn't run out of power, make it feel like a real game so we can feel the suspense. Myb if they added more death scenes but since it's pg 13 we couldn't really get that and that sucks. First 50 min nothing was interesting to me, it seemed really boring but after 1h it got okay ig, we finally got some action going on. So yeah.. that's it, I do recommend the movie for the fans that know the lore.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","emelyb-21729","28 October 2023","Tbh this is something my kids (12 and 14yrs old) who have grown up with Five Nights at Freddy's, from playing it, me buying ""Plushies"", them reading books. I can honestly say they loved it and so did I. They sat here and explained almost everything that happened in the movie. I tbh thought these Plushies were just regular teddy bears kids get into but once my kids explained exactly what the movie explained I was in shock! **SPOILER** a guy that kidnapped kids and killed them and their souls/bodies were put into these animatronics. I did not know that was the backstory again I thought they was just teddy bears. Again I loved that they made a movie explaining what my kids already knew. I give it a 10. My boys have waited for this movie since they've played the game/plushies 6plus years and they did not disappoint. My kids and I are expecting another movie for sure.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","FunnyCritic","28 October 2023","Through the years of learning and understanding FNAF through my son I really enjoyed this film. Like many others I had my doubts on how they would develop a creative story to tells its fans through a movie rather than a video game but they nailed it! We were all very impressed from the artistic attributes to the animatronics, Freddy Faze Bears play place and restaurant. The acting was outstanding! Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard gave out extraordinary performances in the film as well as (""Coreyxkenshin"" <- for the real fans!)This video game franchise has had significant success with their released video games and I believe that they will have more success with FNAF movies in the future!","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","randomgamertag","28 October 2023","I have been enjoying the games for almost 10 years and I'm immensely surprised by how much I enjoyed the film. Just the feeling I had during the entire film was constant happiness with how they could mix elements of the games for just fan fare to how well they could also juggle the plot in a way that a casual audience could understand and digest and have fun with. All the minor details to make the experience closer to the games really got to me.Seeing Coryxkenshin, The references to Sparky the Dog, and MATPAT made me lose my mind. I am so happy I avoided spoilers for the movie because I feel overwhelmed with emotions after watching it.Thank you Blumhouse
Thank you Scott Cawthon.","

"Five Nights at Freddy's","xhxwbtt","31 October 2023","I'm putting a 1 because I can't put a 0. The film doesn't make any sense, the script has open flaws, there's no character building, it didn't take the references from the games (Mike doesn't even spend 5 nights at Freddy's), the plot twist is extremely weak which I could understand from the first 20 minutes of the film. Detail: the film isn't even horror, it doesn't scare you and it doesn't have any psychological terror.The reason they gave for the animatronics being cursed is so weak, so poor, so meaningless that for that reason alone it deserves a low score.Other than that, what is the need to delve deeper into the issue of Abby's custody? What did this add to the story? ANYTHING!",NA
