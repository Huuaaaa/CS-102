"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Tweetienator","21 November 2023","In my opinion, there are two major issues with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","kevin_robbins","20 November 2023","My wife and I watched The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023) in theaters last night. The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","skylermoore","23 November 2023","No matter how faithful a movie is to the book, it can't save itself from the fact that it's unneeded. Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","nscoby93","23 November 2023","I don't know where to start this review as I am just exhausted. Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, ""What am I missing?"" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, ""There's more?"" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","vitordrios","16 November 2023","Funny people in the comments not expecting songs from a movie that starts with the name THE BALLAD OF.The whole point of the movie was to show how Snow starting rising to power and also how the Capitol started being manipulated into start liking and watching the games.It was a great adaptation, the most faithful one since Catching Fire. Rachel Zegler is a great singer and a great actress. The songs are very important to the story, every song contains an important part of the movie ESPECIALLY the one she sings laying down by the lake.People need to actually pay attention to what they're watching.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ArchilArjevanidze","17 November 2023","I'm staggered by the stupidity of the script, the characters, story arcs, motive, plot. It's mindless and random most of the times, seemed like an AI wrote it based on a templates of generic films. Good guy turns bad just because story needs him to be, two characters fall in love just for the sake of it. The dialogue between friends is constant plot point and a script note where main dude always highlights how he is poor and his friend has a rich dad, it can become a fun game because whenever these two are in the scene together you start to expect it to be mentioned, and it always does lol. Very bad, maybe writers strike affected it, but it's based on a book and I don't know maybe it's the source, I doubt I'll read it after this anyway.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Sleepin_Dragon","17 November 2023","It's been some years since the franchise have us Mockingjay Part 2, my interest peaked at Catching Fire, but slowly diminished as it went on, I thought this looked recent from that trailer, for me though this was a bit of a damp squib, it wasn't bad, it just didn't hold my attention, a film I just couldn't get into.I had a feeling the film would struggle without Jennifer Lawrence, and it really did, I had no issues with Rachel Zegler's acting, indeed I thought the was rather good, but I couldn't attach to hers, or any of the characters, I just found them all a little anonymous, and almost impossible to empathise with.A mixed bag in terms of production, I thought some of the visuals were great, some terrific special effects, but all of that music, it just wasn't for me, I didn't quite see the appeal.Do yourself a favour, go and see Saltburn instead, an infinitely better film, I did thr double, that captivated me, this one sent me to sleep.5/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","movieman6-413-929510","19 November 2023","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a prequel to the Hunger Games film series. This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","gabriel-80","15 November 2023","I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","imaxxing","18 November 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is about as overlong as its title might suggest. It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth.Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition.The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader.He partakes as a ""mentor"" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war.The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor.The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV.She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality.The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels.5/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","dannibairstow","26 November 2023","I will start by saying I don't think it's an 8, maybe a 7.5-7.7 so I rounded up.However, I went in with low expectations, expecting a big budget movie with a poor storyline but otherwise reasonably watchable. Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray"" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews. Like, what were you watching!?","

The writing and acting are so over the top, it's impossible to truly take it seriously. There are legitimately good actors in this film and they can't even come close to saving it.There's no likable characters, making it difficult to feel invested in them. Some of the production design is nice, but it's not enough to overcome all the other issues the movie has. The whole thing is a slog, the same scene repeated over and over again with slight variations. Very strange pacing.I'm truly upset that I spent $20 and a couple hours of my life to watch this dumpster fire.","

Viola Davis is excellent, atmosphere and setting are ok, but all in all it feels like you're watching 3 different movies in one, scenario is - again - the main issue. Main actor lacks charisma and just isn't good enough to be a lead. The singing is really annoying, I don't care if it's like that in the book, they could have integrated it in a much better way.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","cinemapersonified","2 December 2023","Rating: 4.7
Overall, a poorly executed movie as the direction and writing fail to build Snow up to be a bad guy to the point that they have to force this by the time the movie ends (making the first two acts of the movie feel pointless), but the movie is entertaining in the second act because they convey The Hunger Games well.Pretty Bad Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good as the director uses the large sets, VFX, and cinematography to help paint these grand scenes in both the capital and the arena of The Hunger Games (while at the same time showing its grime and dark side), the direction of The Hunger Games was good and kept the movie engaging in the middle part; the direction on a microscale was bad as the interpersonal scenes did not feel fluid at all and were not well executed; the direction of actors was bad as none of of the performances felt like they were elevated by direction; storytelling was poor as there doesn't feel like a sense of where the movie is going as builds to one thing and drastically disposes of it in favor of a something else), Decent Acting (Pretty Good from Tom Blyth (Shows some range of emotion and shows both the good and the bad side of Snow decently well), Pretty Bad from Rachel Zegler (Her accent kept on slipping and she kinda feels out of place with the rest of the cast (and the chemistry between her and Blyth is not the best); her musical moments (while forced) were carried out well as she shows off how good of a singer she is), Pretty Good from Peter Dinklage (Really just feels like he is playing many of the characters he has played in the past (the drunk character who has a lot to say) so he kinda just goes on his own), Good from Jason Schwartzman (The best performance of the movie as he plays the comedic relief character well), Pretty Bad from Hunter Schafer (Very emotionless and doesn't have any emotion with Blyth), Decent from Josh Andrés Rivera (Has moments where he shines and some moments where it feels like he's overacting), Decent from Viola Davis (Not really her best performance as it is a lot of overacting (but it doesn't feel like it is a bad performance, just not the best direction)), Decent from the rest of the cast (Hard to comment as most of the cast is child actors who feel like they weren't given the best direction)), Bad Story (The concept was pretty good as it was interesting to see the early Hunger Games and the origins of President Snow (though the carrying out of this concept was very bad); the story contruction was terrible as first act drags so much that its boring and the third act is completely out of place as it felt like they forgot to make Snow the bad guy (the second act is pretty good as its just The Hunger Games and plays to the strengths of the franchise); storytelling/flow between sequences was bad as every scene just felt forced and nothing felt like it flowed between each other (and this is especially seen in the final act as the movie has to make up for making Snow be the good guy when hes supposed to be the bad guy; character writing was very bad (Snow is terribly written as they put so much emphasis on sympathiszing him and making him be the good guy that they run out of time in making him be the bad guy and rush/force this part of the character in the end, Lucy Gray Baird is not written either as you really don't cate about her as her singing just gets really annoying towards the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue did not flow and was kinda forced; the tension build was good and carried out well in The Hunger Games act; the symbolism was very shallow as it does not do a good job in building Snow's journey for power; the foreshadowing was none-existent as the movie forces the ending because they forgot to make Snow the bad guy in the first two acts), Good Score (Carries different motifs from the original franchise), Good Cinematography (Helped show how grand the capital was and helped build the world (especially in The Hunger Games)), Good Sound (Helped in the action scenes), Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Helped make the movie feel like it was a part of the franchise and did not feel over-the-top in any way), Good Production Design (Helped with building the world), Plot Structure was the biggest issue for the movie as 2 out of the three acts were pointless (the first act builds Snow to be a good guy and really drags, the second act is pretty good as it is just The Hunger Games, and the third act is just so forced as it clearly shows that they forgot to make Snow the bad guys so they rush to give him moments that show how he's not a good person); The movie could've been split into two movies to help with runtime (with the entire third act being spun off to show how bad of a person Snow is as there are some moments in the second act that could allude to him being a bad guy, something a second movie could take and build on), Pacing was slow in the first and third act (especially in the third) but pretty good in the second act as the fast pace helped build tension in The Hunger Games, Climax was so underwhelming it was more laughable than entertaining, Tone was very similar to other Hunger Games movies.","

The characters have similar dialogues to the ones found in the books. The actors do good acting. The scenes have the right pacing. Yet, the movie is boring and you end up not caring about anything that happened.I guess reading the story from the point of view of cunning Snow helps us understand better his feeling and motivations, here we don't have that and the actor have next to no chemistry! Their actions don't seem like a natural progression of their love and feel more like ""this happens next cause the book said so"".I was really looking forward to watching it.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","brianjohnson-20043","22 November 2023","I started the book but did not get far. And now after watching the movie I realize that I would have liked it probably even less if I had read the entire book. Probably the biggest problem is that none of the main characters seem likable or realistic enough in the world for me to root for them or have the emotional down-spiral of the characters to be a good tragic drama.There is sort of this 1950s steampunk aesthetic that also made no sense to me given that this is supposed to take place in our distance future rather than the somewhat recent past. How/why would TVs in the future start to become anything like TV screens from the 50s? Are they also going to reinvent laserdiscs?The way the hunger games unfolds makes it feel completely absurd that the winner would win even with all of the cheating. Also the 2 big dramatic scenes after the games just seems confusing. Especially intermixed with some of the other scenes around them. Maybe he works better with all of the perspectives and time that an author is given in a book. But it certainly didn't make a lot of sense to me.Stumbling across the guns later in the film seemed way too coincidental too. And the motivations of the main characters was so inconsistent from one moment to the next near the end that he started to seem bipolar and phycho. I don't think they sufficiently developed his character so one could understand why/how he would work so hard for power and control. The beginning had him challenged that power and control so much that it was a wonder why he would even want any power and control over a society that he just barely seemed to care about.All in all. It's a mess, but interesting to try to follow because it seems to be such a mess.The actors seemed alright. The music was good. The cinematography was fine. But the story and characters didn't seem well developed to me. And I was frequently wondering why these characters and this timeline was being presented given that it didn't seem to answer many questions compare to all the questions and problems it raised.","

None of the films gave me something wonderful and so special that it left such an impression on me. This new release doesn't deviate much from that. It is again a very weak film that fails to develop a story in a captivating way. This actually occurs during the middle of the film, where most of the action scenes take place. The film as a whole always seems to drag on, but part 2 is much better than the rest precisely because it escapes this tiring pace that doesn't go anywhere. Part 3 is where it gets even more tiring. The film always seems to be coming to an end, but it never ends. The beginning and middle seem not to be connected with the end. It feels like you're watching two movies and it ends up being even more unbearable. There are many problems in the development of the story as a whole, especially those of some important characters. It's a mediocre film that doesn't deviate from the franchise's standards. It's not the worst, it's not the best. It is a film that becomes forgettable.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","simoneminotti","16 November 2023","I like the other hunger games movies, with their high and lows they were enjoyable. They were a good transposition of the books.With this one I was waiting impatiently for the end.Performances felt a little bit off, as off felt the dialogues. However the main problem to me is the lack of a central idea. It is not clear if they wanted to show a specific edition of the hunger games, if they wanted to explore Lucy and the other tributes, if they wanted to tell the story from Snow's perspective or if they wanted to explain how the modern hunger game came to life. The film it's all over the places, characters are not explored nor do they make an effort to allow the viewer to empathize with them, they're so empty and unlikable.If this is not enough they even sing. Lucy Grey straight out from the arena, after seeing the death of 24plus people is on a stage singing like a mermaid. And the singing goes on and on to the point where I can confidently sai that the last 30 minutes the film become a musical.The only likable character is portrayed by Dinklage and he dies.","

Really. Tedious and tiresome.The directing is just abysmally horrible.And then there are the actors. Holy crow, you won't care one bit about them. And the worst of the worst is the girl who plays Lucy Grey. She cannot act her way out of a paper bag. It is of no wonder Disney cancelled Snow ""White. She's horrible.And speaking of horrible, adding insult to injury, we are forced to listen to her sing the most dismally boring tunes literally every 15 minutes.My head was going to explode. She has a horrible voice too with poor pitch and a vibrato that will make your ear drums twitch.I truly wonder who thought this movie was a good idea.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","stevenschultz-80475","30 December 2023","What do you get when you cross a backstory nobody asked for with a near ten years hiatus?Trash.The lone bright spot in this movie is Jason Schwartzman's Lucky Flickerman, but even that character is a little too on the nose. Throughout the movie, Lucky included, there are nods as if to say ""Hey you, you remember The Hunger Games, right? Remember how much you loved the Hunger Games?""
At the same time, there is this bizarre knockoff Fallout aesthetic that permeates everything. It's a post apocalyptic dystopia following a terrible civil war, but also everything is old timey like the 1940s?On top of the terrible execution of world-building, and the weird 2020s Disney angle of ""giving a heartless villain a sympathetic backstory,"" it feels like the cast of this movie was pulled out of a McDonald's kitchen. Not a single character other than Lucky is the least bit memorable, and Lucy Gray's accent borders on a hate crime.If you like the Hunger Games, just rewatch Catching Fire.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","maiananaa","23 December 2023","The tributes pictured to be willingly killing each other without any meaningful explanation. Even the lead character Lucy could just let a sick girl drinking a poisonous water without doing anything even though the arena was clear, in my opinion at least.We are supposed to have something to hold on to when watching this, and I don't supposed it could be those mentors, who could just stand still seeing everyone killed each other as a career without no remorse.I remembered the passion watching Hunger Games came from Katniss' spirit of fighting, and also her compassion. Even at the most desperate moments, she still tried to find a way to save the one next to her. I think that's what make the horrible games could light a bit of hope.But in this movie, it just became meaningless. I don't think the singing at the end of the game could turn us to be more sympathetic. I don't know whether the games itself were designed to be more underrated in this franchise, but the characters themselves didn't exactly try to make us root for them.And also the sequence somehow didn't make sense, how could one fall in love easily with someone who just watched her fighting over her life the whole time? Not to mention to be a watching material by the whole nation.. At least there should be a little grudge or hate emotion at first, but no... Lucy and Snow seemed not to be able to keep their eyes off of each other from the very beginning.At least for me, it just made the story less natural, it seemed to be forced to fit the purpose of Snow and the plot just made it become less likeable from the start. It was supposed to be a heroic fight (games), instead we were served with typical teenage romance.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","DymSym","2 January 2024","If the hunger games was all about fascist myth making and how people just come to accept it as the new way of life, why would the protagonist be less angry 10 years into the new order than 75 years? When injustice is a new, people are supposed to be more angry, less accepting of it. Katniss was appropriately angry and defiant, whereas Lucy Gray was immediately giddy (i guess we are meant to interpret it as hippie freespirit i-love-all-peoples charm), and flirting with an agent of the state that has literally reaped her into an arena to kill her. Think of how much it would take to justify why a Jewish girl might even consider thinking of an SS soldier in a romantic light, and how little this story did to that end. The trust and romance between two characters from opposing sides of a fascist occupation has to OVERCOME that very tall barrier to earn any Rebel's trust. However even though the fact that Snow is doing it for personal gain was established, it was kind of ignored to continue this bizzare unearned romance.I am also okay with the premise that not every person in a fascist system is born evil, and showing the descent of a regular citizen into this kind of evil. However, living and participating every day in a fascist state has to impact your soul that ends up showing in small ways, casual dehuminisation of the Panem citizens, growing paranoia as the bombs start, disdain for the rebels etc. Which other characters in the academy and Grandma Snow does. But exceptionally, Snow was shown to be upstanding and moral throughout the movie except in the end with a abrupt descent into betraying his friend, all the while romancing a Panem citizen outside the district borders. It was so forced, and why?? We already knew that Snow would become evil, so why not show us how it happened in a believable manner (maybe show that his time as a peacekeeper interacting with D12 citizens allowed him to dehumanize them or something..), instead of rushing it as a ""twist"" at the very end of a very long movie? Every story in THG was a self contained plot that will be developed upon it, but this one felt like a botched incomplete story to that is built as a premise for sequels to the prequel.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ajcontre16","17 November 2023","As someone who has read the book multiple times, this is an awful adaption of an incredibly well written book. The entire movie is rushed to the point where it should have been split into two. Important characters are barely involved or completely cut out. How do you show Clemencia get bitten by the snakes then nothing of her afterwards????! No Pluribus Bell, Satiria or interactions with the Plinths... Viola Davis is a remarkable job with what she was given, but come one!!! No Hippity hoppity, not once? So much of the fear of her character comes from her craziness and it was missing.There was absolutely no chemistry between Snow and Lucy Gray. Their relationship is completely left out of the movie and that is due to the rush through of the story. Rachel Ziegler was a terrible choice for this role. She may be able to sing, but cannot act at all. Her entire portrayal of Lucy Gray was off and disappointing.The book it full of character development for Coriolanus Snow that isn't depicted in the film. You don't see the struggle he has within himself, let alone the final blow to his goodness by loosing the trust and love of Lucy Gray. This change is what makes Snow who he is later in life and why, I believe, he hates Katniss. There are many similarities between these two women and Katniss reminds him of a past weakness and betrayal. This is shown by subtle foreshadowing. Unfortunately we don't see these changes of character in the movie and that is the entire point of the book. To find out why Snow became an evil and spineless person without feeling.So many important moments were left off or changed that it was frustrating and took every ounce of self control not to walk out of the theater. Poorly done...","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","mickeythechamp","13 December 2023","The Hunger Games return and I'm not sure whySure, I was exited as any to return to this universe and have some fun. While I'm not the biggest fan of the original movies, I still see them as very entertaining. The problem here is the lack of focus and missing some really easy focus points. This movie is really easy to save by simply focusing on one of the storylines more, but it derails itself by being more or less 2 movies in one, and I would have preferred this to be split so we really got a situation where we could dive deep into the world and it's characters instead of a surface level look.Coriolanus Snow is a young man training to become leader of the capital. He and his fellow classmates are assigned to make the 10th Hunger Game more interesting by making the contestants famous before fighting.The biggest issues with the movie to me is the aforementioned lack of focus. The movie is very easy to fixed by focusing on some of its elements more, since they are actually interesting. Making a movie about the first fame Hunger Game is such a good idea. What went right and wrong, how would they turn the people and the ideas, and some of these elements are here, but are never in the forefront. The same could be said about the journey of Snow. He has to turn into something, but that journey is not clear or well-made. The first half of the movie his barely in focus, and by the end, the journey he makes in the second half doesn't match the first. It's a mes. Even the romance aspect is rushed. The movie wanted to do too many things at once, and the result makes a movie that is barely about the things it's about.The characters also lack depth and story to really make us care and root for them. Snow's character is poorly explained, since everybody goes along with his idea, even people in power! Why? He's a kid! The lack of emotions and attachments really got to me, and it bored me.Because the movie becomes boring. It got to a point where I simply didn't care anymore. It goes from one thing and derails into its own sequel, and without the focus it feels uneventful, and it becomes too long, split this movie into 2 with more focus, and you have 2 decent movies.There are some good performances and shots though and some really gripping scenes, some involving guns, some with mockingbirds, it's interesting that the movie feels this well-made while the script doesn't, I think the grandness despaired for me. The Hunger Games isn't big yet, and it can be felt. It seems more boring and lifeless, and that's the point, the problem is that we, the audience, also fell that.I also need to question the Katniss moment from the first Hunger Games. It bothers me that she started a rebellion when she did. In this movie, there is even a Katniss type character doing a similar event to hers. Why didn't that start a riot? Who knows.While some of the performances are good, the dialogue is terrible and the actors don't have a lot to work with, sadly. It makes them look bad, but it's easy to distinguish that it's not the actor but their material.This movie with a way too long title is a mess. I really wanted to like it and while there are elements I did like, the story told just simply didn't grip me at all. It was a boring and too long experience, and the problem for me is that I can see the easy fixes, which means the team missed it somehow.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","naomix-07733","18 November 2023","Initially I didn't like the ending. I didn't like how they just made her 'disappear'. I was voicing my frustration to my sister the entire way home; No chase? No fighting? No crying, no betrayal, no epilogue, no letter? Nothing??? It was so anti-climactic! Like she never even existed!But then Highbotton's words rang clear: mystery has a way of driving people mad. If we the audience were this frustrated, imagine just how delirious it must've made Snow. She could've outed him, betrayed him, stood up to him, maybe even messaged him- he must've searched for her if just to get rid of the last loose end (before he became too powerful to even bother with this anymore, of course), but he found absolutely nothing! Nothing to chase, nothing to hate, nothing to even confirm that it was real other than his fading memories, white roses and a ghost of her who with the same spirit sings that damn song under the hanging tree.I can't help but think that what if she'd stayed? He'd lied, and he had violence, and all those other bad things in his being already, but the only thing that was keeping him from going through that door was Lucy gray. It doesn't excuse nor explain his action (not even by the slightest) but I can't help but wonder if she'd stayed, would he still turn out that way? Not necessarily the whole tyrannical dictator coming into power stuff- but fundamentally could he have become a better human being? Could he have changed? And was her departure his sign to finally cave in, or was he going to turn out like that anyway?Also the hunger games were freaking crazy I loved every second of it, favorite part of the movie. Jason Schwartzman was perfect.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Fizgig777","7 February 2024","First off, the script writer, if they read the book the movie is supposed to be based on, did not have a good understanding of the story and completely missed the character development and connections between them. There are some movies based on books where you can get away with not faithfully telling the story and still leave the viewer feeling like the story was told.... That did NOT work for this book to movie combo. While the movie was overly lengthy, it still didn't capture the essence of the story. What it captured was a lot of bad acting, particularly the female lead. Unlike the book, I couldn't get invested in any of the characters in the movie at all; didn't care who lived or died. The evolution of a marginally decent human being to a completely despot wasn't shown well by the movie at all. Maybe emotion behind that transformation is better written and read.... One thing is certain, the lead male actor just wasn't up to that kind of acting - he wasn't particularly good as it was.As a standalone movie, it's terrible; convoluted, overly lengthy, boring. As a prequel, it falls way short.... As an adaptation of a well written novel, an embarrassment.Feel sorry for folks who payed to see this poor adaptation.... Read the book! Unfortunately, the movie was so badly done, it likely put ppl off the book if they hadn't already read it.","

The pacing seems way too quick to establish any sort of connection.I don't think this movie deserves to be titled ""The Hunger Games"". It doesn't come close to the story telling of the original franchise. Besides, the CGI used in this movie occasionally gives vibes of a low budget production (smoke, fire, ...).Personally, I wouldn't recommend the movie. It joins the ranks of productions like ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", a pathetic attempt at reviving a franchise which already died happily.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Elvis-Del-Valle","29 November 2023","Despite the disappointing ending to the saga in Mockingjay Part 2, that did not prevent us from continuing to explore the universe of The Hunger Games further. This prequel focuses on Snow's beginnings as a humble young man who questions the methods that the Capitol uses to discipline the rebels, but throughout the film he discovers the truth about what human beings are capable of. All through his relationship with Lucy Gray hoping to regulate the methods of the Capitol. Unlike the previous films, this is a longer and more dramatic story that does not focus solely on the Hunger Games, but mostly on Snow's transmission. It is a worthy installment that serves as a prologue to the saga, even without the presence of Katniss Everdeen. It has that metaphorical characteristic that has always defined the saga with respect to capitalism, social inequality and what human beings are capable of doing by instinct. Rachel Zegler gives a spectacular performance in many ways, including her musical numbers. There is no doubt that The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a great film that revives the saga again and is a good option for those who do not know the saga to begin to enter this apocalyptic universe created by Suzanne Collins. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.","

Real disappointment and big waste of time. I thought till the end, there must be a conclusion, something connecting the dots. But they left the dots as they were.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","echerie7","15 November 2023","This movie was so disappointing, there was just something missing across the board. Acting was okay but none of the actors had chemistry, the stakes didn't feel very high at any point, and the singing was both excessive and borderline comical in timing. The movie preached many times that viewers need someone to root for and someone to hate, whilst simultaneously doing the exact opposite by giving us neither.What made the original Hunger Games great was that you believed in the characters backstories, and you could get drawn into it. Snow and Casca felt real, but everyone else somehow felt like a caricature of a person. Kudos to both of these actors who did a phenomenal job, it just somehow wasn't cohesive with the other characters who felt somewhat 2-dimensional.Lucy in particular felt over-acted and I struggled to root for her - the chemistry with Snow falling particularly flat. Did I mention the singing was insanely overdone? In contrast, the brief screen time that Clemensia and Snow shared felt far more genuine and intriguing, and I would've liked to understand her and Snow's friendship more.Overall the movie felt messy and lacking in heart. I had been so excited for this movie for so long and was disappointed at how disconnected it felt. Whilst I understand that singing is woven throughout the book, this felt like one of those things that in a movie felt out of place. Perhaps it was the way it was acted, I'm not sure, but even as low budget as the 1st Hunger Games movie was.... I felt connected to the characters and their journey, which was not the case here.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","valid_point","18 November 2023","Watching 2h 38min was as long as it sounds. The beginning looked promising: the yet undeveloped execution of the Hunger Games, the whole scenery or the introducing of Snow as the anti-hero who never actually despises the idea of the Hunger Games but still is human, empathetic and caring. There was some sort of character shift towards turning evil (like the scene he admits killing this one tribune felt powerful), but it never really got to a breaking point. Nevertheless Tom Blyth was the perfect choice who did a great job at what the writers gave him - which was way more than what they did to build a proper love story. Lucy's and Snow's romance felt forced, rushed and unconvincing.Which brings me to the biggest problem the film has: Rachel Zegler. Her acting was so poor I couldn't grasp any personality traits of Lucy Gray who should have been the strong woman on the outside but scared woman on the inside. Instead, her whole presence drowned in arrogance which didn't stop even after Lucy just experienced the most horrific days in her life in the Hunger Games Arena (like shouldn't she suffer from PTSD?)
Zegler has absolutely zero charisma that watching her felt exhausting. She definitely is a gifted singer - as the movie shows us several times - but that doesn't compensate her complete lack of acting skills. On the contrary, the more she sings the more the movie turns into these unnecessary and irritating musical episodes of any CW show.So if you are a fan of the original Hunger Games movies, you will definitely found enjoyable moments - if you already dislike Rachel Zegler before watching this movie, I would skip it.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","raul-verma","19 November 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" attempts to explore the origins of a notorious villain, President Snow, but ultimately falls short in its execution. While the concept of delving into the past of such a complex character is intriguing, the narrative feels sluggish and fails to deliver the depth and intensity expected from the Hunger Games universe.The portrayal of a young Coriolanus Snow lacks the compelling depth needed to justify his transformation into the iconic antagonist of the original trilogy. The pacing struggles to maintain engagement, with stretches of the story feeling drawn out and disconnected. Additionally, the dynamic between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray Baird, the tribute he mentors, lacks the emotional resonance required to truly invest the audience in their relationship. Rachel Zeigler acting sucks as well.Moreover, the exploration of the early Hunger Games lacks the gripping tension and moral complexity that made the original trilogy so captivating. Instead, it feels more like a diluted version, missing the edge-of-your-seat excitement and the thought-provoking commentary on society and power dynamics.Overall, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" fails to live up to the standards set by the previous Hunger Games installments, offering a lackluster portrayal of a compelling villain's origins and missing the mark in terms of both storytelling and character development.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","dehoopdanielle","16 November 2023","I came out of the cinema with my friend and we both wondered what we had actually just seen.Is this a villain origin story?Because if so, then why is there NO character arc for Snow at all?From the moment you meet Coriolanus Snow (despite the lacking story still wonderfully played by Tom Blyth), he is selfish, overly ambitious and mean. For this reason, I don't buy into his romance with Lucy for a minute, and I actually think they didn't want you to. But if the romance isn't real, that means there is no catalyst for Snow's character to make him evil, because as I said, he was already selfish, manipulative and mean to begin with. It makes you wonder why we needed this film in the first place.Next to this, I didn't understand Lucy's character. She wears colorful clothes, lots of make-up and sings musical songs which all feels off for someone living in district 12.On top of this, I also didn't understand her motives and emotions. Is she angry she has to fight for her life in the hunger games? She didn't really seem to be to me, as she quickly trusts Snow and eats his food and even tries to kiss him. And then when she wins the fight you would expect her to be traumatized and bitter, but no, she just picks up her guitar again and dances around in her not-so-Gray clothes.Finally, as the romance isn't real, why did she invite Snow to escape with her to the North and then on the way there tries to get rid of him?! It just didn't make sense to me AT ALL.Still gave this three stars because I liked Tom Blyth's performance and the visuals were nice, I guess.","

I don't know what to expect from here on out, but I hope to be as entertained, if not more, by the original movies of the series.The story was engaging and separated into three parts that made it enjoyable. Everything from the introduction of the Games to evasions to conclusions were well executed. Despite the film being violent prone it still comes across as tense and deadly without showing anything too gruesome to maintain its PG rating.The acting was strong. The actors were well suited for their roles, and only based on trailers, I found the young Snow builds well for the original movies, but unknown for certain. I loved the chemistry between Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth.The music was terrific. Zegler has an amazing voice, and her songs obviously work well into the film. The visuals are mostly incredible. There's a few spots where it's very obviously screen acting. Part of me hopes they did have physical sets cause there were portions that felt genuine.Overall, you don't need to have seen the previous films to understand what's going on, but it may help to better understand who the characters are. Acting is strong, music is great, and the story is amazing enough to make me want to see the rest of ""The Hunger Games"".That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Kim_F_T_R","15 November 2023","Incredibly disappointing, and here's why:
Too much content and story forced into the movie, making it rushed and, at times, quite messy.Hardly any likable characters; didn't get to know any of them particularly well and certainly didn't sympathize with them.Too much singing.Some props, costumes, and elements threw me off, making me forget this was part of the Hunger Games universe. It felt more like a drama romance from the present time, especially in the second half of the movie. Some characters seemed oddly 2023-like, despite being set hundreds of years into the future. Rachel Zegler, in particular, just ""looks"" Gen Z.Viola Davis, the queen, in a cheap costume and with an even cheaper manuscript.The other Hunger Games movies were like an emotional rollercoaster, whereas this movie left me uninterested and little invested. I was really not looking forward to feeling ""nothing"".","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","andrewsteff","19 November 2023","I really wanted to like this movie, I rewatched all the originals right before and it only made this movie look so much paler in comparison. The actual ""Hunger Game"" in the movie at its most basic state in the timeline was entertaining while it lasted and the lead playing a young Snow along with Viola Davis chewing the scenery as a maniacal villain are the highlights, but too many musical numbers (there was all of one instance of singing in the original series) along with the stiff acting of the female lead and the tired length, made this seem like a Hunger Games if it was made by Disney. A bit too cheesy and long in the tooth, and a disappointment when held in regards of what came before.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","houstonperez","26 December 2023","As someone who has read the book multiple times, this is an awful adaption of an incredibly well written book. The entire movie is rushed to the point where it should have been split into two. Important characters are barely involved or completely cut out. How do you show Clemencia get bitten by the snakes then nothing of her afterwards????! No Pluribus Bell, Satiria or interactions with the Plinths... Viola Davis is a remarkable job with what she was given, but come on!!! No Hippity hoppity, not once? So much of the fear of her character comes from her craziness and it was missing.There was absolutely no chemistry between Snow and Lucy Gray. Their relationship is completely left out of the movie and that is due to the rush through of the story. Rachel Ziegler was a terrible choice for this role. She may be able to sing, but cannot act at all. Her entire portrayal of Lucy Gray was off and disappointing.The book it full of character development for Coriolanus Snow that isn't depicted in the film. You don't see the struggle he has within himself, let alone the final blow to his goodness by loosing the trust and love of Lucy Gray. This change is what makes Snow who he is later in life and why, I believe, he hates Katniss. There are many similarities between these two women and Katniss reminds him of a past weakness and betrayal. This is shown by subtle foreshadowing. Unfortunately we don't see these changes of character in the movie and that is the entire point of the book. To find out why Snow became an evil and spineless person without feeling.So many important moments were left off or changed that it was frustrating and took every ounce of self control not to walk out of the theater. Poorly done...One last thing! Great job Rachel Zegler, you succeeded in ruining another movie just by the charm of your horrible acting, singing, facial expressions and explicit talent to not learn any skill required to succeed as an actress. Amazing casting for Snow, that guy nailed the role, but holy moly what a utter pile dog-sheet this movie was because of Rachel Zegler. Don't even get me started on the singing. Its unreal how this unfunny personality is getting such major roles whereas super talented talent out there never sees the light of the day. Rachel Zegler is an absolute talentless person and should not be given roles as significant as this one.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Gleek4eva","18 November 2023","I saw this movie on opening night. I have not been able to stop thinking about it since... I read the original trilogy but never got around to reading the prequel but decided to just see the movie. Rachel Zegler receives hate because of a comment she made about a completely different movie (Snow White), and it's completely irrelevant to this movie. She performed more than beautifully in this role. She is a classically trained soprano, and was singing beautifully in her chest voice and with a really good twangy accent (which is more of a mezzo/alto type of singing in this case). From one classically-trained singer with a degree in music who performs for a living to everyone out there afraid to give this movie a chance because of all of this biases against this young woman- SHE IS GOOD! This girl is talented, and the hate is stupid.This movie was by no means perfect, but it was really good. I would have thought it was a perfect 10 if the action was better paced. It was nothing on her part. Definitely not as good as Catching Fire (the peak of the series to me), but better than both of the Mockingjays! Give it a shot without a bias of this young women in your mind and you just might find yourself enjoying it ;)","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Notbrainwashed","18 November 2023","This film is the definition of a split personality. It's called Hunger Games but you only see something like that in it's first half hour, since the filmmakers had the bright idea to escalate the film in it's first act, putting the first act as the second act and then the third act as the second. Are you confused? Well, look at them! The result is that you think the movie is ending but it eventually takes a ""break"" and resumes in about five minutes. I am addressing to you Hollywood movie makers: beginning?, middle?, end?, world building?, exposition?, protagonist testing?, twist?, climax? Don't they remind you of anything? The movie ends and you don't know what you've seen, you are confused. Where is the catharsis? Who is good and who is bad in this movie? I didn't know whose side to take and when the viewer doesn't know whose side to take he's lost.But yes the movie has some positives (thankfully). The soundtrack, cgi and color grading are very good but it's such a shame that these were wasted in a festival of bad script and direction. It's hard to believe that Francis Lawrence has directed this film. Oh and if you're going to turn it into a musical halfway through you'd better tell us from the start.It's unbelievable and sad what is happening in modern Hollywood. They're just trying to make money based on strong and beloved franchises by changing them and throwing in minimal work. The only instances of them coming up with anything worthwhile yet are those of the known greats in the game like Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, Cameron, Villeneuve, Tom Cruz, etc.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","realflunk","23 November 2023","I guess this is just what Hollywood has come to. I always expect more, but no. The audience still get treated for what we are to them; cold cash.It's hard to say where this movie went wrong, because not much went right, really.The movie is set in the amazing dystopian universe created by Suzanne Collins, that the first 2 Hunger Games movies could, to a fairly high degree, do justice.Unfortunately, this movie does everything but. The storyline is scattered all over the place, none of the characters are remotely interesting and the writing is just... oh man. Stop singing!!!The only two good things to say about this movie, are:
1. The production value is high (kudos to the people trying to do their job, even when the state they work in is way below their standard).2. Some of the actors do a good job, considering the scripts they've been given. Tom Blyth and Viola Davis are the two main names here.Unfortunately, the singing Rachel is also in the movie, so you kind of forget that some of the actors actually try to do a good job.Needless to say, I won't be wishing for any snow this winter.","

Many scenes were poorly written and the directing was a bit over-dramtic. But one thing that the whole movie failed for me was the explanation of Snows motivation, how his character developed such strong compassion for the hunger games and why he is who he really is as a president. No character has an evil agenda, unfortunately this movie doesn't show the depth of Snows character. All of the sudden he turns evil and I dont understand his actions. I have not read the book but I believe that there are so much potential. The movie tried to focus on the love interest but failed that part too.","

The film starts with public executions where suddenly someone starts singing, which gives you the feeling of watching a musical, quite cringe. Furthermore, no one is spared, which makes you wonder how cruel the writer of this story is. The structure is otherwise boring, the environment is dark all the time with a kind of gray arena and a lot of the play takes place in caves. There isn't a single heroic or heroic scene, nothing that makes the movie enjoyable. The film had no depth to the characters at all, everyone was equally flat. The movie was so terribly boring that I honestly fled the theater.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","jllyxbaby","31 January 2024","How did this movie get a green light? I haven't read the book but if it's exactly like how this movie is then I'd probably hate the book too. It's really sad because Snow could have had such a better backstory. And is it just me or are a lot of movies now just trying to put singing in wherever they can? Lucy might be like it in the book but I found it rather annoying. When Katniss sang you could see it meant so much. It was deep and powerful and it wasn't over the top. It was songs about serious things. I didn't like Lucy at all. I think there could have been someone else that would have sold her character more. I don't know why but even though they tried to make it seem like they were in love I found that it was quite the opposite. It felt too forced like as if the actors didn't have any chemistry but they just wanted to make it work. Snow's character was strong but it just doesn't seem like a good enough story. I was expecting him to like kill Lucy, instead she disappears(come on!) and he's like oh well I guess I'll just go back to the capitol and wait my turn for president. It doesn't seem like a bad enough excuse for him to be a rotten person. Even if he killed and sold out his best friend, I was expecting a lot more to be on the line or something big taken away from him to turn him into the evil and messed up person he is in the first films. His story just sucks.Often Snow would jump on the back of trucks or do something he shouldn't be right in front of the peacekeepers lol. I know mistakes happen but there was lots of that and it made it feel like it wasn't very believable. I wanted to be completely drawn in and not have to pick out these little things. Unbelievable. Could have and should have drawn the line at mockingjay.","

The problem is this is an incredibly boring villain origin story. Do we blame the book? I read it and it's not great so that's part of the problem...Despite the book's failings I think so much could have been done with the movie, characters better fleshed out, maybe a way to know Snow's inner dialogue would have helped. Anyways Hunger Games fans like myself will watch the movie and probably like it. I gave it a five for the actors who did the best with what they had and a nicely done dystopian world. There's too many misses to mention, but nonsensical plot lines, poor costuming, and lack of real chemistry between the lead characters are top of my list. Like many others have said: I would have much rather seen a Haymitch back story. Maybe that's next!","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","meshouse","17 November 2023","As someone who read the book days before seeing this film, I can tell you it should've been in two parts. I did thoroughly enjoy it! However, there are so many things that they left out that I felt were integral to the story. In order to properly see Snow for who he is-a spineless boy who only does things that look good to others-I think they needed to spend more time with the character. I'm not usually a fan of two parters, but this one really should've been. The characters fell flat to me because we didn't get great looks into them.My boyfriend, who didn't read the book, really liked it and said he felt he understood the characters well enough though. So maybe it's just a me problem.Because so much of the book is Snow's internal monologue, I know it would've been hard to capture that properly on film, but I think they could've. Also, it's SO much darker in the book, and I think that was necessary for the audience to see.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","douglaspereira77","1 December 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes left me feeling like I was stuck in a bizarre dystopian version of American Idol. The story wanders around like it's on a quest for purpose, centering vaguely on two characters who seem as lost as I was trying to follow the plot. And then there's Rachel Zegler, popping up like a musical fairy godmother every 5 minutes. I half-expected her to break into 'Hunger Games: The Musical' , anyone?The film's attempt to weave a compelling narrative feels more like attempting to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded - confusing and with no clear resolution in sight. The decision to turn it into a pseudo-musical only adds to the bewilderment, leaving me wondering if I accidentally stumbled into a Capitol-sponsored talent show.Rachel Zegler's constant musical interludes make you question if she has a secret contract to ensure a song every 300 seconds. It's like the filmmakers discovered a 'Sing for Survival' clause in the Hunger Games rulebook. I can't decide if it's a desperate attempt to inject life into the story or an unintentional audition tape for 'America's Got Talent.'The storyline is as elusive, full of plot holes. It's like they dropped a bag of breadcrumbs in the woods, and we're left wandering in circles, trying to make sense of the narrative maze. The movie's plot is more twisted than the Capitol's fashion choices, leaving me with a sense of confusion.In the end, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes feels like a failed attempt to remix a dystopian classic. It's not a symphony of storytelling; it's a cacophony of confusion with a side of unwanted musical numbers. If the Hunger Games were a competition for viewer endurance, this movie would win hands down. May the odds be ever in your favor if you decide to give it a watch - you might need it.""","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","masonsaul","18 November 2023","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes lacks any subtlety in what the Hunger Games are truly about, allowing it to go further with those core ideas than ever before. The class divide has never been bigger and the desperation that makes people abandon all morals to ensure their success is such a clear through line in this story, even after the games are over.Whilst the film remains engaging throughout, the structure is a little weird. It's nicely divided into 3 chapters with two focusing on the games and one after which means the final third has to speed run Snow's growing villainy. The decision to keep it as one film was greatly appreciated however, either a slightly longer run time or splitting in two might have actually helped for once.Tom Blyth makes the role of Coriolanus Snow his own and is the only reason the complete change of character in the third act works, laying hints throughout that this side of him might have been there all along. Similarly, Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray creates a character who's the complete opposite of Katniss (extroverted, loves performing) and her singing is incredible.Josh Andrés Rivera is the moral centre and real tragedy of the film, a character too pure for the world he's born into. Viola Davis gives such a cartoonish performance in a way only an actor of her calibre could pull off and Jason Schwartzman is the best. He's the only one allowed to have fun with it, delivering the only jokes and continuing what Stanley Tucci started.When it comes to franchise reboots it's usually not a good idea to bring back the same guy who did the last ones but returning director Francis Lawrence does a great job. The practical and CG elements are blended together really well and it's helped massively by Uli Hanisch's production design which crafts a more analogue world with a stripped down Hunger Games.Similarly, returning composer James Newton Howard does another wonderful job. Callbacks are kept to a minimum and replaced with some epic tragedy that compliments the doomed romance whilst once again communicating the brutality of the games in a way the PG-13 rating still can't.","

What a long-winded mess that didn't make sense. I looked at my Apple Watch in the cinema a few times thinking when will the movie end. The motivation behind certain characters are not very convincing or not properly elaborated, although the movie itself seemed to have gone on forever. Acting is sub-par, perhaps could have improved with better casting. There was too much singing in the movie that just didn't fit. I was expecting some emotions to be stirred but I felt flat and disappointed after.

Characters you could care nothing about. Seemed like a show piece for Rachel Zegler to sing horrible songs. Everyone is a bad guy, until they aren't, then they are, then they are all plotting together to basically get to the next scene. Writing: Gawd aweful and presented with no emotion. You're supposed to ""care"" about the contestants, but you really don't. I really struggled to find any point to this movie. The writers must have just thrown the script up in the air and put it back together as they picked them off the floor. Movie has no ""bite"" to it. Supposed (I think) to show everyone means something by playing the Games only to not really play the games. Instead just avoid any attempt to win the games, that apparently, nobody is watching.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","vengeance20","17 November 2023","So, having seen the previous 4 films, I did hear not long after there would be prequels to follow. Of course, time went on & there was little to no word if a prequel was coming until I saw a trailer pop up a few month prior to me seeing this & to be honest, I didn't feel bought by it, but still, being a fan of the Hunger Games, I went to see this nonetheless.Years before he becomes the tyrannical president of Panem, 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow remains the last hope for his fading lineage. With the 10th annual Hunger Games fast approaching, the young Snow becomes alarmed when he's assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird from District 12. Uniting their instincts for showmanship & political savvy, they race against time to ultimately reveal who's a songbird & who's a snake.I found the film to be surprisingly good & better than what I thought. I mean, it wasn't as upbeat or vibrant as the first 2 Hunger Games Films, but still was action packed enough & watchable despite dragging near the end & in other places too. The films runtime is 2 hours & 27 minutes in length & could've 20-25 minutes shorter.The characters were good & memorable enough & the games were exciting enough & enjoyable when the action did kick into gear. The music & visuals were good as with the effects that were used. Though I do feel the film could've benefited from being livened up a bit & again, be faster paced & shorter. It lacks the feel of the original films, but of course I did expect as much with this film being a prequel to the first 4 films.Overall, it was actually pretty good for a prequel. While it drags & is a whopping 147 minutes, it's a good film that's worth a watch. It's got good enough action in it along with some great characters, visuals & effects. But could've been shorter, faster paced & more vibrant.7/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","isaacsundaralingam","17 November 2023","I am not the biggest fan of the Hunger Games franchise. I don't hate it, but I've never found anything all that likeable about it. It was, and still is my opinion that the Hunger Games are the weakest execution of the battle royale concept in all of film and television. So naturally, I didn't really have high hopes going into this movie.The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is split into 3 parts: the first, an introduction to Coriolanus Snow and his friendship with Lucy Gray; the second, the actual Hunger Games; and the third, the aftermath. I have to admit that I did find the first two parts somewhat enjoyable, albeit the obvious lack of any serious character development. It still had some charm and some wit about it to keep me interested, despite it feeling like the writers didn't really put in the effort to lay the foundations to make these characters live up to their full potentials.But all of that was nothing compared to how unbelievably disappointing the final part was. If you thought the character development in the first two parts were rushed, you're not ready for what the third has done. Characters are going through serious mental and philosophical transformations within periods that make it almost comical to watch, and through actions that just make no sense given the context of what has already been established. It was jarring and felt like it needed its own movie to flesh the action out to be consistent.This movie does nothing to change my opinion on the franchise. Maybe makes it slightly worse, but I could ignore it on a good day. For the fans of the Hunger Games and for those who care a lot about the series however, this movie could be a fun 150 minutes.","

Unbelievably slow and boring. Lack of chemistry between 'Lucy Gray' and Snow, was genuinely quite confusing watching their relationship. Why did Snow turn evil? Actually unsure. So many plot holes. The hunger games were extremely hard to watch, so gory and unnecessary. Could not stand Lucy Gray as a character, she weirdly kept breaking into song. NO comedic relief whatsoever. All characters were poorly developed, and for the most part unlikeable. Costume design felt really poorly executed, all of the costumes for the 'poor' felt very inaccurate, looked like they had gone to a fancy dress shop and asked for Aladdin clothing. Also why was Lucy Gray playing what looked like a very expensive guitar. Extremely inconsistent as some parts felt modern and some felt extremely old- fashioned. The 3 parts to the movie were poorly split and it honestly was so long for really nothing much to happen, was very choppy. Only good part was Snow being extremely hot.","

He is mesmerized by District 12's Lucy Gray and her singing. Coriolanus wants to achieve back his family's lost glory and he wants to do it through Lucy Gray. He along with his best friend Sejanus are sympathetic towards the tributes and wants to do the right thing, amidst the rebel's constant attacks. What truly happens post the Hunger Games, the impact it has on Coriolanus and his friendship forms rest of the story.This was indeed a lengthy film and unlike the earlier trilogy, this doesn't feature the Hunger Games for that long. Probably, that is what got me a bit restless as the drama took a whole 2 parts to settle in. It is only in the part 3 where I was able to invest properly as the story focused on Coriolanus, Sejanus and Lucy Gray. What the film did succeed in getting the dystopian world setting despite the Hunger Games segment not being that intense. This still manages to set up the story for the sequels to take over and there is enough mystery intact to stay interested.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Coventry","26 December 2023","As chairman of the federation against unnecessary overlong movies and, moreover, active member of a committee entitled ""your film's title should be shorter"", you can imagine that I wasn't really looking forward to - here we go - ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"". 158 minutes! 158 minutes for a prequel of which you know from beforehand how it will end! Because basically the essence of the film is, like in ""Joker"" or ""Star Wars: episode III: Revenge of the Sith"", about how the protagonist will eventually turn into a sardonic and loathsome villain.But hey, it was Christmas day, my wife wanted a family trip to the cinema, and we chose ""Ballad etc"" because we enjoyed the original films starring Jennifer Lawrence and Donald Sutherland. And, for the record, it's a good and enjoyable movie. The performances of most of the cast members are terrific, there are a handful of highly memorable action sequences, a few remarkable twists & gimmicks, and a plot that is compelling despite often being convoluted.Remember the almighty Sutherland as the relentless and tyrannical President Snow? Well, this movie goes 64 years back in time, to when Coriolanus Snow was a hunky 19-year-old student at Capitol Academy and about to witness the announcement of an innovative new rule for the upcoming 10th edition of the annual Hunger Games. The most prominent academy students are obliged to mentor the participants from the different districts from now onwards, and Snow gets assigned to the seemingly fragile District-12 girl Lucy Grey Baird.The screenplay is neatly divided in three chapters. The Mentor is about the acquaintance between young Snow and Lucy Grey. The Prize revolves around the actual Hunger Games that still integrally take place in the arena. And then The Peacekeeper about Snow's banishment from the Capitol, his dubious adventures in District-12, and his further mental descent into darkness. Although every chapter contains multiple highlights and tension-peaks, they each should have been a bit shorter. It must be said, the film owes a lot of its impact and power to the performance of Tom Blyth as the charismatic and emotionally versatile Snow. I read a lot of harsh comments about the performance of Rachel Zegler, but I didn't think she was too bad. Could have done without the singing, admittedly.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ghoult-58762","28 December 2023","Book to movie adaptations have a habit of cutting out character development and worldbuilding, which is to be expected due to time constraints. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem if they hadn't decided to completely erase some of the MAIN characters. The few people mentioned by name in the movie were rewritten to the point that it makes their characters seem like entirely different people. In the books, Coriolanus Snow is a sociopath who is downright evil and worships his father, who is basically American Hitler. In the movies, he comes off as sympathetic. The directors rewrote lines, added lines, added scenes, deleted scenes, and threw stuff around until they made a jumbled-up mess of the original. It's like the director and writers read the plot points on SparkNotes instead actually reading the book. Out of all the movies I've seen, this one was one of the biggest letdowns. There are so many fans who have waited so long for this movie. Money is not the problem. And neither is time, considering people have waited this many years already. Either Suzanne Collins did not have the ability to offer much input for this movie or she did not care to correct them. Because this movie is a hot mess. Spectacularly terrible adaptation.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","zawally","25 November 2023","The latest Hunger Games installment introduced a captivating concept, but its execution left much to be desired. Unexpectedly, certain scenes carried a whimsical Disney musical vibe, a stark departure from the series' gritty tone. The depiction of arena deaths fell disappointingly flat, lacking the visceral impact that defined the franchise. Moreover, the CGI work was subpar, failing to immerse the audience effectively.However, the film wasn't without its merits. A standout feature was the commendable ensemble cast, with each actor bringing a nuanced performance. Yet, some talents were sadly underutilized, leaving viewers wanting more from characters who had the potential for greater depth and development.One major flaw that overshadowed the positives was the rushed pacing of the narrative. The movie struggled to explore the intricacies of its intriguing concept thoroughly. A more deliberate approach, possibly as a two-part installment, could have allowed for a more immersive and satisfying exploration of the dystopian world.Despite its shortcomings, the film managed to maintain a semblance of the franchise's essence. The core themes of rebellion, survival, and sacrifice were present, but the execution failed to capture the intensity that fans expected. In essence, the latest Hunger Games installment had all the ingredients for success, but its hasty execution prevented it from reaching the heights of its predecessors.","

Although I enjoy how brutal and violence this film is, it lacks of thrill, little to no action, and have a weird amount of singing scene.... and for what reason?Blyth did a good job portraying Snow and his characters is well written, while Zegler's character lacks of charm and borderline cringe.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","AfricanBro","19 November 2023","A reoccurring thought throughout the movie for me was It felt like a movie plot that was so easy to sell. If they had to convince studio executives to green light the movie, or convince the actors to take the role. Describing the plot to someone makes it more interesting than the movie actually was. It somehow just doesn't culminate into something special.I was, in the slightest sense, excited for this because I'm a sucker for dystopian films. Starts off very dark and gloomy, depicting a war torn landscape and giving off an aura similar to that of the original hunger games movies. However we get to see this from a different perspective from those, we get to see it from inside the Capitol. I think it's good that it's made by the same people, so it felt consistent with the franchise. World building was great visually speaking, you still get the same classism and hierarchy and politics, but now from the inside. Not from the victims eyes but oppressors.Feels more more of an introduction to this world than I expected it to be, because we already knew the premise of these movies. I think it could've been better showing us the inaugural hunger games, not the 10th.I think it could've worked better if it didn't have a lead role, instead of it being Snow's background/origin story, (which I don't think was necessary) it could've been the hunger games themself's origin story. They were already a thing at this point. Loved seeing the origin of the ""hanging tree"" song though.They could've given Rachel Zeglar more to do, it felt like all they wrote her to do was sing. Oh she sings here, she sings there, she sings everywhere. Felt more repetitive than impactful (maybe it's because I'm not the biggest musical lover lol). Viola Davis was great, you can put her character up there with Amanda Wallis, just insane cold hearted characters. I wonder what happens with her Dr Volumnia Gaul character in the future. Peter Dinklage didn't have as much time as I expected but he made the most of it. Acting was great throughout the cast. Burn Gorman shows up in the last act, seems like he's made for such type of roles also. Type casting.I wish they didn't shy away from the gore and violence, but it was pg13 and action was still decent. It's not as quick paced but it's okay. Never had me at the edge of my seat as I expected. The one thing that actually annoyed me was there were so many moments when I was literally screaming ""run"" at the characters and they took so long to react.It is pretty long, but a lot happens to fill up the time. I liked that they divided it. The crappy thing is knowing that Snow survives, removes some thrill from it.I think it should've been better and more captivating. They had enough material to work with but it's just not as exciting. The characters weren't as easy to root for, I thought Rachel zeglar was great and did the most she could've done; but I just didn't feel taken in by her the way Jennifer Lawrence made katniss. She wasn't someone to root for and felt forgettable. It felt like they could've given her more to work with.Tom Blyth's portrayal of Snow was excellent, yet knowing the eventual transformation of the character into a tyrant in the future might have impacted the viewing experience. The attempt by the writers to hint at this evolution felt inconsistent with the character's present age and personality. It might have been more effective if they depicted him as a villainous, power-hungry individual masquerading as good, or just straight up good and thrown all their eggs in that basket. Instead, the portrayal fluctuated between moments of genuine goodness, power-hungry actions, and conflicting motivations. At times, he prioritized his family, while at others, he pursued power or seemed invested in his affection for Lucy Gray. The character's motivations seemed muddled, making it challenging for the narrative to balance these conflicting traits effectively.It wasn't the rise of snow, it was just his childhood, but they still wanted us to see the Snow we knew, if this was a trilogy I'd assume they couldve shown us the evil side of him in the sequel. That could've better and more easily shown good character development and arc, while it felt too squeezed in here.The movie is broken up into three parts and you'd expect them to be building up to something, but the last third is dull. Doesn't get better the more you watch it. And how it was separated made it feel like i was binge watching a series, which I think would've been a better adaptation than a movie. Someone said it felt like two movies in one because they were unsure of a sequel could happen.I think it's an okay entry to the hunger games franchise, it's a decent foundation for sequels but it just feels like it wasn't made the best it could've. It feels like an unnecessary reboot. It's not too bad but it's pretty far from being anything special, just lingers around being little better than mediocre for me. However I am still excited of what they can do from here with the sequels.","

In his role he is just brilliant, so thanks for at least his performance.The casting for Snow was also not bad, but the rest of the actors can be forgotten. Above all, we couldn't stand the calling of 'Lucy Gray' after what felt like the 100th time.We're generally not big fans of singing in movies, but these songs were placed so tactlessly that it felt like imitating a Disney film. The only suspenseful part is in the last section of the movie - precisely when it ends.! It seems like the whole movie is made for teenagers. Overexplained and repetitive scenes dominate. We're glad we didn't watch the film in the cinema.","

As a result, a relatively boring movie. It felt as though there was so much context to provide there was no time to make it enjoyable. Some exciting parts but this was only attributable to Suzanne Collins' writing; I believe the directors heavily relied on the plot already written for them. Rachel exaggerated jaw acting made this not only a boring watch but a difficult one. Lucy Gray was a textbook manic pixie dream girl - I thought cinema would be more self aware by now.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","johnnykashed","21 December 2023","The first hour of this movie is dreadfully boring. I actually fell asleep in the theater for the first time in my life, and that's what compelled me to write this. I understand the importance of singing to the story, but it doesn't match the tone of the movie AT ALL. We're just bursting out into song like it's a 2010 Disney channel movie. I feel like I got whiplash every time she started singing because of how wrong it is for the tone of this film. Additionally, I felt embarrassed for the actors during several of the dramatic scenes leading up to the games. And then you get to the actual games...I don't know that I've ever seen a film with such an unearned display of violence. It's genuinely brutal. I normally applaud a film that has the balls to kill a kid. It's usually unexpected, and when done well, it creates incredible tension. In this movie, you're expecting kids to die, which somehow just adds to how distasteful the actual violence is. It's completely unearned. We've had random singing, terrible dramatic acting, scenes that feel like TikTok fan fiction, and everyone in the capital is twirling their moustache like a Bond villain. Whether the writers like it or not, this movie is WAY too campy to allow for this kind of brutal violence and social metaphor.I don't even really want to get into the last 45 minutes, or whatever it was. The main guy acts like a sociopath the entire film, and we know who he becomes, so I don't feel I'm spoiling anything by saying that he continues to be a sociopath, and everyone acts accordingly. And it's boring, and confusing. So its boring until it's violent, and then it's boring again, with a little bit of pointless confusion sprinkled on top.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","jace_the_film_guy","27 December 2023","As someone who enjoyed the original ""Hunger Games"" films, this movie was a trip back to a world I fondly remember. The direction, the score and the set/costume design are all reminiscent of the original movies. There was an anxious energy pulsing throughout the film, which made me think of Katniss, Peeta and the events that unfold 64 years in the future.The bond between the two leads in palpable, with both Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler) mirroring each other. Across the board, the characters were fascinating and had a depth to their motivations. This film is the origin story of a villain, and the filmmakers do not shy away from that fact.As is the case with many film adaptations of movies, some of the dialogue was a little stiff and ""book-ish"". Like the original books/movies, a lot of the names are outlandish and hard to remember; Coriolanus, Volumnia and Sejanus to name a few. While this doesn't detract from the film, it does take a minute to get used to some of the verbiage.A lot happens in the 2-hour 37-minute runtime of this movie. I'm not usually an advocate for breaking a film into two parts, but it might have been appropriate in this case. By the end of the second act, it felt like the story was wrapping up, only to have 53 minutes left to go. Wisely, the film uses title cards to break up the story into three acts (i.e., Part I: The Mentor) which helps with the pacing.Recently, there have been many attempts by big studios to revitalize beloved franchises. Most of these attempts have not met much critical acclaim (i.e., ""Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them""). This film is an outlier to that negative trend and feels like a story that needed to be told, rather than a cash-grab. The plot is thought-provoking and well-conceived, the characters are intriguing, and I left the theater wanting to re-watch the franchise again.Best Character: Coriolanus

Overall this movie was boring and not true to the source material. The aesthetic also did not fit the timeline (set in future) making it seem so far into the past.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ThereelscoopwithKK","23 November 2023","There's a lot to like about this movie, but it just doesn't hit the same way the original Hunger Games did. At many points in the movie there seems to be an opportunity to look deeper into the psyche that drives Snow, but instead they only explore it at the surface level. Not sure yet if it's the script or the actor just didn't have the ability to deliver it.Viola Davis for me had the standout performance. She owned her character and was able to create the evil eery feeling of the Panem totalitarian state that the other characters weren't as successful in portraying as the original films. On the other side of things, Peter Dinklage seemed disinterested and didn't really offer much in his role.The overall filming quality and shots are quite good but of course a huge appeal to the Hunger games is seeing the stadium and for obvious reasons this one is a lot more basic than in previous movies.Hunger Games had a good run but I'm afraid the appeal/ interest of it has worn off a little bit over the years .","

I appreciate it's a long film but that's because they were trying to do too much all in one film. Some of the actors were over the top and theatrical rather than displaying substance which was surprising considering the big names in this movie. Some big names in this film yet they disappointed us as they really felt to of lacked depth. I've seen them in films where they have been truly astounding yet they fell flat here. I can't help but wonder if it's because of how rushed this was, you didn't have time to become invested in any of the characters. The previous hunger games reallly felt powerful and hit a nerve, this felt showy and lacking in depth. On a positive note I liked the singing and the female lead, I just wish they given her more time to provide suspense in many moments instead of rushing through.

That means you have to have seen the other movies too. This being a prequel - I assume you have seen the other Hunger Games movies, but this is the extent of me mentioning them - well going into details.Let me add that there are a few things in this (not just characters) that carry over. Some are connected to people in the new (old) movies and we also get to see origin stuff (how did that came to be and so forth). The acting is really good, the story is tight and the Games are just one small part of the whole thing. Actually you may be surprised about how much other stuff is being done and talked about. Winter may not be coming yet, but Snow is here ... and he is here to stay (well and go ... and come back ... and stuff like that! As always no pun intended here either).If you liked the other movies you will find something in this one too. I am not sure if this is based on a novel too (not just the characters, but the story overall), so as you can tell, I can not give you any scoop on how accurate it is to the writers vision ... maybe it's better to watch without any preconception of things anyway (?)","

Despite the 2 hours and 37 minute run time the story is rushed and relationships/plotlines were not developed.The romance between Snow and Lucy was developed slowly yet deeply in the book and their relationship made sense. In the film you have to use your imagination (go figure) to see how the two could have fallen for each other in such a short period of time. There was absolutely no chemistry between the actors in the film and their casting was terrible.In the book, Lucy is extremely likeable and Snow's motives are developed with much more depth. In the film, Lucy is underwhelming at best and not likeable more often than not.The voice actor whom sings in the audiobook does wonderful renditions of the songs in the film, which leads the films versions to be very disappointing.Sejanus was annoying in the book but was a likeable character, in the film Sejanus is just annoying.The casting/acting were terrible in this film. I half expected to find out that this was the director's first film and that the casting director was an intern.Lastly, Maude Ivory was a truly missed opportunity.

It's a movie where start to finish, absolutely nothing happens or has impact other than the 3 heavily focused maguffins which might as well have big neon signs pointing at them that they will shortly be used to move the glacial plot forwards.This feels like they googled a few key words from the originals and just crowbarred them into this abysmal movie. You can happily live your life as a hunger games fan having never seen this tripe.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","adamcheese","16 November 2023","No of course Katniss isn't in it. The singing is integral to the story, how can you complain about it? It seems many criticisms people are writing about this movie are simply due to individuals not understanding/processing the plot of the film and making judgments based on a lack of comprehension.This movie is a worthy addition to the Hunger Games franchise, satisfying the one question I had coming into it: Why is Snow such a psychopath?Additionally, we get to see another (old fashioned) Hunger Games which we've been waiting for, for nearly a decade!Having not read the book before seeing this film, it really enlightened me to information surrounding the society of Panem that I was previously unaware of / ignorant to.Not a perfect film, but a very good one nonetheless. 8.5/10 at least! I pray there's more to come from Suzanne Collins' mind.","

The characters are bland and most of them annoying , especially Lucy Gray who starts singing out of the blue every step of the way.I think the only likeable characters are Tigris who has little to almost no screen time and Sejanus who acts like a moral compass throughout the movie and who was done dirty. Otherwise I wasn't rooting for anyone .I kinda regret starting the movie but I wanted to give it a try. Now I want to finish it on principle because I hate living movies and shows unfinished not because I like it in any shape of form.It's a pity because its such a downgrade compared to the previous Hunger Games. The only good thing in this movie is Viola Davis who is spectacular as always ... other than that nope, nothing.","

The worst was zegler and the rest would follow her on the list
2- hunger games used to be fought in visually pleasing environments, this one was in a dark theatre?? I mean how lazy they were that couldn't come up with a better location.3- lighting was so bad, i thought i was watching Batman2022, i had to put the brightness on max just to see their shadows moving around
4- characters development sucked big time, didn't feel a thing for anyone of them
5- too slow, too dull , too directionless, too pointless
I could name at least 10 more negative points but i feel this movie doesn't deserve more of my time.Do not watch it if you respect yourself.","

Their work stinks, and the director put the final nail in the coffin.This is the sort of movie one would expect from one's teenage son after gifting him his first camcorder and clapperboard combo. Little Jimmy went off to play with his friends and came back with this rubbish.The actors should seek alternative employment, and the producers should just move to Florida and forget all about life. As for the audio people, they seem a lost cause entirely. The audio quality of this movie was terrible. Don't studios that invest millions of dollars in movies check for basics such as the sound quality?This is another movie that puts me off new movies. I'm just going to watch old black and white flicks for a while, and I'll check back on the new stuff after the bad memory of this rot has faded a bit, and in the hope that Hollywood has past its dead years and has started making movies worth watching again.

Plus the whole premise for the plot was never clearly defined. Additionally, there were some major fopauxs with some of the CG.

The dialogue was so confusing, and the characters made no sense. Every scene something didn't make quite sense. Wether it was a characters reaction, or his motives. And it doesn't help that the main character is so stupid to look at. It seemed like they tried to make him look complex all the time or cynical, but he just ended up being really unrelatable. But probably the thing that annoyed me the most was the chapter thing. Why did they make it in to three chapters, when the ""chapters"" just blend into eachother. Maybe the gap between chapter 2 and 3 made sense, because that he was transferred. But the chapter 3 screen was so short, that it didn't seem as if, we were going to a new chapter of the story. Because the new chapter just started so quickly. The movie also tried so much to be a kind of masterpiece, but that didn't work either.","

Everything is either poorly done or then very overacted, over dramatic and pompous. Starting from acting, to costumes, to special effect, writing, everything, it was either poor or mediocre. It felt like I was watching an over length episode of a lousy stream series which is cancelled after the first season due to poor view ratings. Then some extra things like musical style singing to reflect the story with dramatic fashion was totally overacting and way too overdramatic. Just an example of weird decision to add extra drama into the movie. Everything felt so out of the place.Other reviews have also mentioned that the scenes were loosely connected. I also felt it was like that. Not to mention that it was very difficult to follow what really this movie is about. The story is so confusing. I had no idea after the movie that what the districts are there fore, what is the Capitol, what are these mean looking soldiers and how they fit into the concept of Capitol, what these hungergames are really for and so on. The amount of open questions was like vast. Then the sheer amount of talking with completely meaningless dialogue. Oh my God.After the second part, the movie is split into parts by the way, I was completely lost that what the story in the movie is actually all about. Then some story lines are concluded with super lame fashion. Just suddenly something is happening just for some reason to kill the characters so that the storyline can be concluded.This kind of movie makes me really think that how the movie industry is going so wrong with big budget movies. Somehow I believe that at 80s or 90s with this budget, people at the industry would had made something way much better. In this movie, there is virtually nothing spectacular, nothing to see explicitly at the cinema. This movie is a total filler into stream service catalog what you may watch into some point at home and then just close the movie because it's so lousy. Maybe stream services are killing the cinema industry inside out. Who knows...","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","arsalanweb","23 December 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" had the potential to be a compelling addition to the franchise, but unfortunately, it fails to live up to the expectations set by its predecessors. While it attempts to delve into the origins of the Hunger Games and the character of President Snow, the execution leaves much to be desired.One of the major drawbacks of the film is the pacing. The narrative feels sluggish, with long stretches of monotony that test the audience's patience. The attempt to build a complex character in President Snow falls short, as the film struggles to make him a sympathetic or even intriguing figure. Instead, he comes across as one-dimensional, lacking the depth and complexity that would have added layers to the story.The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes also suffers from a lack of emotional resonance. Unlike its predecessors, this installment fails to evoke the same level of empathy for the characters or a genuine connection to the dystopian world of Panem. The emotional beats feel forced, and the stakes don't seem as high, making it difficult for the audience to become fully invested in the unfolding events.Furthermore, the film's visual and cinematic elements are a letdown. The special effects and action sequences, which were once a highlight of the Hunger Games series, appear lackluster and uninspired in this installment. The film's visual style lacks the innovative flair that made the previous entries stand out, contributing to a sense of mediocrity.While some may appreciate the attempt to explore the darker corners of the Hunger Games universe, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying cinematic experience. It's a forgettable addition to the franchise, lacking the intensity and impact that made the original films so memorable. Fans of the Hunger Games series may find themselves disappointed by this lackluster ballad that, unfortunately, falls flat.","

Honestly, that is a big factor of the book that is missing. The love for the character. Personally, I really feel as Rachel's current controversies and backlash going on in the world. She should step back for a moment. She needs to think on her choice of words and understand where the fans are coming from. We are the ones that consume, so shouldn't that be a factor.","

I'm a big hunger games fan, and granted I haven't read the book, the movie was really dull. I don't know whether the book was depicting the same thing or not but I thought that Rachel's perfomance carried no emotion at all. She didn't make me care for the character at all. She's also surprinsingly close to Katniss with mannerisms, which ended up looking like a cheap cosplay rather than anything. Also, having her breaking into songs every 20mins, which imo didn't add anything to the movie half the time just made this even duller.The small arena part felt somewhat useless, almost like it wasn't part of the movie, few kills, then just hiding away defenceless and winning solely by breaking into song? Lmao.Also, it might just be me but having ""Lucy grey"" shouted every 5mins, without any alterations like just ""Lucy"" or ""miss Grey"" I don't know, it just got on my nerves a little bit, especially in the last scene with the trees.I have a hard time understanding why a film with quite a good cast felt so numb. It didn't feel useful at all. It felt like a fan made rendition of the hunger games with a high budget. It felt rushed, unfinished, unpolished. I had such big expectations for this movie as I wanted it to be of the same standard as the other films but it just wasn't, at all.","

Not being based on a book of course I didn't know what it really was about going in. How disappointed I was.The story is about President Snow in his youth and no one could want to learn about the most hated character in the original series. Who cares what he did growing up and why he became a monster? No one. It was also made in a cheap romance setting that never would fly in the books, which immediately lost my interest.The main protagonist was well acted and semi interesting, but she wasn't given interesting material to run with, so our engagement into her character was greatly reduced. This felt like a Twilight remake without vampires, which is fine for kids, but appeals to no one else. The big named actors were wasted and the pacing was so slow I honestly wasn't sure I was going to make it through.My only hope is this doesn't become a series if movies, because this story didn't need to be told at all.","

I only wish that it focused more on this and not the interpersonal relationships Snow formed, relationships which had little to no impact on the story beyond just serving as plot devices to move the narrative forward.I wish the capital was explored more as well as the victors who won the war. None of this is explored beyond mere references that we already know about from the trilogy.Overall, the movie is an average attempt at revisiting the lore of The Hunger Games.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","channellius","27 November 2023","I watched this in the cinema with my younger sisters yesterday, all of us having reasonably enjoyed the Hunger Games books and bits of the movie series before this.I think there were a lot of nice points about this movie - the setting felt pretty believable, the acting was generally good... but I think the story itself was a bit weak, and for some reason I was really turned off by all the singing bits.In terms of the story, it was fascinating seeing the main character grapple with his concepts of what he knew was right and wrong, and what FELT right and wrong to him, but I think the female lead didn't really have any real development or much actual likeability - she felt like a pasted classic ""good folk girl"" kind of character, except for setting snakes on people?? I didn't really sense much chemistry with her and Snow's characters, because it didn't seem like they even any notable spent time together, and her disappearance at the end, leaving the snake to attack him, felt so strange. Why did she waste time setting up a nasty trick like that, if it wasn't going to kill him, and serve just to slow her escape down, and also make him hate her? Was she just trying to make some kind of risky point? I don't know, it just didn't really make sense to me.And the singing... I can't say exactly what bothered me about it, but it just felt weird. I found the singing scenes long and kind of painful - I guess it didn't feel like someone in that setting sincerely singing, but someone from 2023 singing for a 2023 movie and pretending to add a folk kind of twang to it. She's a great singer, I'm not denying that, but it didn't feel like it fit with the setting somehow.Overall, I guess the movie was somewhat interesting, though I wouldn't say ""enjoyable"". I wouldn't recommend it to friends, but maybe the book's pacing is better? I don't expect I'll be reading it though, unfortunately.","

I loved Katniss so much I even named my Cat , Katniss. Maybe include people from other districts (3rd world countries) when making such movies, to add depth to the story.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","DeanAmythe","29 November 2023","Beyond the frankly baffling choice to make a Hunger Games prequel and position it in a time where the Games are already part of the status quo, there is a ton of wasted potential here. My lack of investment in this series can not be understated, but even I was looking forward to seeing Panem built upon - what it actually provides on that front, though, is practically null, and when you remove the context the audience is already familiar with, it completely fails to sketch a decent picture. I haven't kept it a secret that I wasn't particularly enamored with the filmmaking in those original entries, however, the way they crafted their world easily outshines any equivalent effort here. District 12 was a tactile place, where the hardships and inequality could be seen and sensed, especially when contrasted with the Capitol, which felt properly different. In Ballad (not writing that title in full), it wouldn't be remiss to assume these two places aren't fundamentally distinct. Yes, the Capitol is technologically more advanced and has the structure of a sprawling, concrete city, but you don't feel that. The outside world is never emphasized, and as such, apart from the mustache-twirling villainy of the Capitol population, it doesn't distinguish itself from the 'lower' districts. From all that you can gather here, District 12 is comprised of an industrial complex with surrounding plains, and the most we ever see of civilian life in here is a crowd at a bar having a pretty good time. This is very much a problem when you consider how the driving force in much of the characterization is the moral push-and-pull some figures from the Capitol are experiencing. According to some, there are pressing matters of inequality and injustice that need to be addressed; yet we don't see much of what those issues are supposed to entail outside of some troopers being nazis. Those troopers are in the Capitol too, and usually enforce their policies fiercely, even in that environmental - again, no palpable basis of inequality is established.The Hunger Games themselves are also, to quote Gaul here, ""dull, dull, dull..."". The nonsensical and often arbitrary construction of the Games in the originals always bothered me, but at the very least they made for some engaging scenarios. Here, you have to thank those rebels for messing up the battlefield, or this would've been even more uninteresting than the repetitive forest: you get some stone, some marble, and a bit of debris. Enjoy looking at that for a while. The action does help elicit something visceral out of this bland arena, utilizing some lengthier takes to assist in providing a proper sense of space during the frantic fights - but outside of these specific scenarios this is not eager to do anything of equivalent value with the camera. The sense of space is even lost in the arena itself, where, despite its simple structure, the positions of the tributes are consistently unclear. Do they just disappear, or are they wandering about in a place we've not been shown?I have no clue how well the book is written - and I wouldn't use that knowledge to judge this adaptation, anyway - but this is stuffed to the brim with story beats that come off as bafflingly unmotivated aside from their presence on the preexisting pages, dots to be connected with no need to consider how and why these junctions work (assuming they did in the book). Especially in a character study this is a major issue: if I can't grasp someone's reasoning or motivation, it's hard to understand and connect to them. It felt as if Snow was simply hopping from one side of his moral quarrel to the other, which is a shame, because I take a liking to these gray areas (in particular in this instance because the Capitol is otherwise an utterly one-dimensional antagonistic force).There are some beacons of light to be found, mainly in the practical sets and some of the performances: Davis is delightfully diabolical, Schwartzman consistently hits his comedic marks and Zegler gets plenty of opportunities to use her vocal chords (and if you get second-hand embarrassment during song in a film you're boring, by the way). The whole thing is just entertaining enough - as you might hope from a blockbuster - but not enough to distract from its glaring problems. Ultimately pointless and unsatisfying - in other words, another Hunger Games film.","

There are some good moments, few and far between, I was feeling pretty bored half way in and was hoping it would end, but no, it goes on... and on. Overall the dialogue is pretty rigid and unnatural, the plot is a bit of a mess, the acting is pretty bad from most - Rachel Zeglar especially cannot act.

My major beef is that the characterization of Snow gave us zero insight into what made him what he was in the future. The acting is good, but the characters are mostly unlikeable. Things are just thrown in without any thought to cohesiveness. Yes, the actress who plays Lucy Gray can sing and the atmosphere was definitely reflective of the capital and the districts, but for the most part the story and Snow were hollow. Just average to bad entertainment.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ghgaskins","26 December 2023","A musical Hunger Games? Viola Davis is embarrassed by this one. She should remove her name from the credits. If this aligns to the book, then it is written to cash in on a previous innovative story. Now it's full of its own cliche's and makes one think the original story didn't age well. Maybe it could have been better with real headliner actors as the main characters vs supporting roles. Peter Dinkledge proved he couldn't carry this one despite him being the only interesting character. They should try this one again because it is either too serious or too dramatic. There are no heroes and the singing is a distraction despite being good music. It just isn't appropriate to the story.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","AreSee5454","22 December 2023","This movie was just not good.Pros:
+ Great casting for Snow.+ Great way of ""showing"" the evolution of the Games.+ Shows why the Capital was angry at the Districts.Cons:
Tries too hard to insert all this nostalgia and/or trying to connect to the future films in such a forced or disingenuous way. (ex: Katniss bow, the swamp potato scene, the on the nose Hanging Tree song to the final act - BTW, to me, the way Lucy sings her original songs throughout the movie is in a different rhythm).Introduction to Lucy in the Reaping really asks you put your suspension of disbelief into overdrive.Lucy (made to be a gypsy like person) looked too well off.Never explains why the Snows are poor even though the father was a great general and was ""part"" of the creation of the Games. You'd think he'd get some retroactive wealth for all his contributions.What was the point of Dr. Gaul's character? The Games were straight forward, so I don't know how the mad scientist plays a part. Remember, snakes only came to play because of an important Capital citizens death.Movie just seems disjointed in many places (ex: Hob bar scene in the backroom).","

I was aware that this film was going to be a more dialogue heavy kind of thing but it was just unbearable. The pacing was awful and it just went on for so long. I'm fine with movies on the longer side but not when you're forced to sit there and watch paint dry for 60% of the movie. I also did not care about any of the characters or their well being. I had no reason to feel emotionally attached to any of them. By all means do what you want and check it out but for me it was a huge yawn. I wanted to walk out of the theater but I sat through it all unfortunately.","

The ONLY somewhat exciting part was the Hunger Games scenes where they fought each other and that's about it. Also, I feel like halfway in through the movie, they didn't quite know what to do with Snow's character and near the end realizing... ""Wait... This guy is supposed to be evil! Let's turn him heel in the last 20 minutes after 2+ hours of seeing him as a bad guy.""Honestly it was so stupid. They should've just stopped at the end of the main Hunger Games franchise and called it a day. Why they decided to capitalize off of that franchise with whatever this was, is a disgrace. Therefore, this for me is a below average Hunger Games movie.","

I really wanted to leave the cinema, and would have if I hadn't come for once with my daughters.Once half way you start hoping: ""ah finally the last plot twist, now the movie can stop... "" and then a new story starts, totally new, out of the blue, little to do with what happened before, they could have gone in 50 directions, and just picked one, for fun of spending money on making movies or so? What a waste of my time and money...
The main actress even sings up to 3 or 5 times the same song, you'd think it has become a musical, but no no, that was just another plot twist.After a while your only hope is to see some nice fighting scenes, but even there the movie disappoints...
I try to find one positive aspect... well, maybe the fashion, the clothes... I appreciated it, or at least considered it ""interesting""...","

I haven't seen a movie in a while that stays with me outside the cinema and makes me think about the events in it.It's unpredictable, and the ending is genius because it excludes the basic happy ending and immerses you in the life and feelings of the main character. There are many ways to debate the decisions made by the protagonist and the reasons for his actions, exploring his motivations and emotions.Genius acting, performance, and filming as well.Have a great day/night!","

The movie had great promise with the idea of a backstory of Snow but the need up turning into some corny Disney musical.I get they tried to show the betrayal that turned Snow into what we was but forcing a quick love story just made it that much harder to watch. The only time me and the family woudk get remotely excited was when they would reference something from the other films.Had so much promise in the beginning but I truly do feel like it ended with the singing. The acting was horrible as well. We couldn't stand watching Zegler for some reason would just get under our skin.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","cinelove93","22 November 2023","I watched Catching Fire right after seeing the newest Hunger Games movie and it made me realise what I was missing in it. The emotions. The OG cast gave stellar performances, eveybody was cast perfectly and conveyed what their characters were going through. The Ballad felt somewhat empty. None of the characters were compelling enough. I found Lucy Gray to be too perfect, her relationship with Snow was rushed and lacked depth. The supporting performances were also mediocre, nowhere near as good as Haymitch, Effie or even tributes like Rue. In a minute of watching Catching Fire I felt more emotions than in the whole Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. It's unfortunate since that's where the strength of this movie should have lied. It is obvious that the games themselves aren't that entertaining to the audience anymore after watching the trilogy. Therefore, Ballad had a lot of potential for character development and conveying the story, the relationships between characters and the chemistry between them in the end...just wasn't there.","

Harry Potter, ad nauseum.There was no good reason to make this movie, except for the money. And sure it will bring in enough money that the makes will call themselves justified.The only decent sequels came from Tolkien's LOTR. The script was good, the acting was good, the sets were good, the cinematography was good. Though Peter Jackson went overboard on the script at times but what he produced was worth watching.They should have stopped with the first film. Hunger Games was somewhat watchable, though I think Jennifer Lawrence was overrated as an actress. One movie was fine, the rest of them were merely indulgence.","

There are no motivation, dialogues or at least logic.When I was watching first two parts - I really thought i like it. But then third one has started...
One of the problem - Snow hasn't changed during the whole movie. As he was egocentric, ready to lie for a purpose - as he is in the end, despite the script trying to hide it - doesn't work at all.Lucy Gray: not so bad as a character. The only thing I didn't like - in the very beginning where she accidentally started to sing - complete disaster, nobody believed that character really can behave like this.","

I love the gritty, pure and raw four movies, especially the first two.This movie feels more like a cheap rom-com that happens to be set in Panem. Zegler is an insufferable pick-me girl that sings like the popular girl at your high school play. I know it says ballad in the title but that does not justify the commercial musical songs that are thrown in there to distract from plotholes.Blythe gets way too much screen time and nevertheless the character development from nice guy to evil Snow falls down from the sky like a dead mockingbird.It's a painful watch that made audience sitting around me cringe at their kissing scenes, because it all seems forced and chemistry is lacking.And why did the make up department decide to give Zegler a YouTuber 2014 Glam Up ? A girl from District 12, come you all can do better.This is nowhere near the previous movies. The extras did well though, a better performance than most actors.","

It was almost like this was a musical because Lucy Gray sang about 6 times. This movie would have gotten a 4 star review if it had ended 45 minutes earlier than it did. One of the only good things about this movie were the actors. The acting was good. There was sooo much killing that was completely random and unnecessary.

Aside from me not knowing much about Snows background and how that leads to the other hunger games movies, the movie is just extremely boring and honestly I think it's really bad acting as well.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","aipsun","5 January 2024","With a longer duration than the previous trilogy, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes should be our guide to exploring the past of Panem, the history of the Hunger Games and of course the dark story behind the main antagonist, President Snow. However, what the prequel presents feels shallow, rushed, and unsatisfying. This film is still interesting in terms of visuals, action scenes, characters (especially Tom Blyth as Coriolanus Snow and Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray Baird) and the brutalist architectural setting of The Capitol. The Ballad may not be as good as the Hunger Games trilogy but it quite stands out among the franchise and of course Rachel Zegler can sing.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","enacheadrian","26 December 2023","The new Hunger Games movie took a surprising turn, deviating from its action-packed roots to become more of a musical, which was quite unexpected. The focus on a handful of songs over a prolonged duration made it feel disjointed and detracted from the core theme of the Hunger Games. Instead of delving into the gritty, survivalist aspects that the series is known for, the film centers almost entirely on two characters, whose storylines overshadow the broader narrative of the Hunger Games. This shift in focus and genre may disappoint fans who were anticipating the high-stakes action and intense drama typical of the Hunger Games saga.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Louis_Walrus","26 November 2023","I did not expect to enjoy this film.I am a fan of the hunger games franchise, I read the original trilogy of books and really enjoyed the first two movies, however since the realise of mockingjay part 1 and 2 movies, which were extremely lacklustre, I have completely lost all interest in the franchise and never paid any attention since.Therefore upon hearing about this new addition to the franchise earlier this year, I wasn't too bothered and forgot about it. Then I saw it was released, and just decided to go see because why not. I hadn't seen any trailers and knew nothing about it, just that it was based on a new book by Suzanne Collins.I had absolutely zero expectations, although the cynical part of me thought I might be wasting my time, especially after seeing the runtime on the movie. However, 3 hours later I can admit I left the cinema feeling rather impressed. I genuinely enjoyed it.While the hunger games trilogy we know with Katniss Everdeen strike me as a fun, rewatchable teen-fantasy, in the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, we see a much darker and grittier side of the world of Panem, which I felt resulted in experiencing a much more horrifying reality of the games themselves. It felt more real, and grounded, and loved seeing how everything operated with far more inferior technology and fewer established rules.Since watching the movie I've seen criticism of the characters and acting, and while I am usually quite strict on that kind of thing too, I genuinely see their points here. I understand Rachel Zegler is an actress of controversy for a lot of people, I myself have seen a lot of debatable interviews with her, but I believe she shows of her talent here with a great performance. The standout performance is definitely Tom Blyth and a young president Snow however, an actor who I have not seen in anything else before. I found myself genuinely caring about the fate of the two characters and their relationship, which is a hard thing to achieve, and i feel is the core element of this movie, therefore really enjoyed because of it. The supporting characters were also well performed, such as Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis.The movie is split into three chapters, like a book. Chapters 1 and 2 are certainly the stronger of the three, which I very much enjoyed for reasons already stated. Despite still enjoying chapter 3, and completely recognising it's importance, I feel as though it was slightly rushed, and therefore perhaps would be understood more by people who have read the book and have pre-existing knowledge of the hunger games.Although certainly not a flawless movie, I am pleasantly surprised by it and had a fun time watching. I would recommend if you fancy a movie night. 7.5/10.","

The producers learned a hard lesson, but now it seems like it was even too hard for them, cause ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" feels like it has adapted two books into one movie, even thought it didn't.This movie has some serious timing problems. It's definitely too long, but at the same time manages to make you feel like the second part of it is too short and should be extended. I feel like it should be separated into two movies. One about the 10th Hunger Games and the rise of Snow (this doesn't really need much more, that the first hour and a half of this movie) and another one about how he turned from an ambitious boy in love to a overambitious manipulator and tyrant (this one definitely needs more time and depth).The most frustrating thing about the new Hunger Games movie is that literally every element of it is interesting, but still none of them is really well done and fulfills its potential. The main character is interesting, writers try to make him deep, they almost succed, but then they don't have enough time to finish the job, cause the movie cannot be even longer than it actually is.In the end, I feel so much wasted potential that it makes me angry, even thought I'm not really emotionally invested in the franchise.","

Despite high expectations, the film fails to capture the essence of Suzanne Collins' gripping trilogy, leaving audiences yearning for the intensity and emotional depth that defined the source material.From the moment the opening credits begin, it becomes painfully evident that Rachel Zegler's Hunger Games is marred by a sea of cringe-worthy performances that even the most forgiving viewer will struggle to overlook. The cast, including Zegler herself, delivers a collective display of wooden acting that undermines the gravity of the dystopian world they're supposed to inhabit.","

On the other hand, the movies based on the trilogy are so powerful and energetic that they have turned Katniss into a symbol.And now, a few words about this movie:
My expectations were, rightly so, enormous-at least 7, maybe even 8 stars. After just half an hour, it became clear to me that this film is simply a waste of time-nothing substantial!

""The Hunger Games"" is one of the most important dystopian series ever created because it's targeted towards young adults. This franchise is shaping young minds, it's an absolute wonder. Although I miss the frenzy that came with the movie during that era, I am so happy I get to experience a different story in the same universe. In ""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" Snow is the protagonist. A younger maybe more human version of Snow. This is the story about Lucy Gray, but don't get it confused, when the time comes this story can have only one main protagonist and that is Snow. I love everything Francis Lawrence brought to this movie, he knows how to craft them, set the setting and he knows how to navigate us through Panem. I really don't mind how this is a long movie because it's divided in three parts where every single one of them tells a different story about Snow. Every single one of them is essential in realising how he grew into the bloodthirsty,ruthless man that became the President of Panem. Rachel Zegler's Lucy Gray is nothing like Katniss but she has all fascinated with her charm. Viola Davis is so good an actor that she stole every single one of the scenes she is in. She's so fascinatingly evil. I feel like this movie brings a new perspective to the dystopian world of Panem, it brings a new insight in everything that lead to the events of the trilogy and a much needed insight I feel, to the philosophy of the Games as an event. I really am looking forward to reading the book, Suzanne Collins has done it again and I'm falling into the ""Hunger Games"" spiral once more.","

In this Games there's so many clues this is decades before the original Games movies were set with older technology in TV Monitors, cameras, architecture and even Peace Keepers uniforms (they don't look like Storm Troopers yet).It's got a 50's America vibe, which will tap in nicely to the current retro trend of everything old is new again in 2023.Jason Schwartzman plays the first ever host of The Hunger Games as ""Lucky Flickerman"" (Weatherman & Magician) is a scene stealer with some of the best lines.He is of course part of a media family dynasty that includes Caesar Flickerman (Stan Tucci) in the original four part trilogy.While not as polished as his Grandson he reminds everyone to ""smile..that's why you have teeth"" something Caesar took to heart with his cheesy Hollywood smile.Yet again the drones play a part in distributing water and other much needed supplies to the tributes, but it's new technology and they need to iron out a few bugs in these deadly drones.Every movie lately is divided into chapters with titles superimposed on the big screen.I blame the rise of Audiobooks, but I shouldn't complain because I've narrated a few.Listen out for: ""Can't Catch Me Now"" by Olivia Rodrigo in the closing credits.If you want to know how quickly civilisation disappears you've come to the right movie.Everything is about winning in The Hunger Games saga and this origins movie is no different.Enjoy the show...all 2 hrs 37 Minutes of epic Hunger Games action, adventure and drama.This will be one of the smash hits of Summer 2023!You are invited to return to the Games which have been a welcome addition to our movie universe for over a decade.You just know Snow will land on top, but it's also good to see Snow fall.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","gabe-82146","25 December 2023","I loved the dark totalitarian atmosphere of the original trilogy with fantastic acting, impressive set/costume design, and next-level writing. This movie completely subverts these expectations. Surely it has a different director? Nope-it's the same guy who directed the trilogy. Is it based on a novel by a different author? Nope. Same source material. So how the hell did it go so wrong that it feels like a low-budget Hunger Games live action fan fic courtesy of Kidz Bop and YouTube TV?The moment this movie begins, it feels like an edgy anime show. Exposition hits like a truck, and it's clear the writers don't even remotely trust you to glean that the main cast are elitists without making them the laziest, most one-dimensional portrayals of ""elite rich kids"" I've seen in years with over-the-top cartoonish snobbiness. ""Hello class partner! We do every project together!"" ""Hello rich dad kid. Surprised your dad bought you out of trouble AGAIN >:("". It's like they constantly tread the line of ""show don't tell"" so recklessly that even when they're showing, it feels like you're being spoon fed every piece of information they want you to know.The entire premise just doesn't make sense. Why are they trusting 18-year-old kids (played by 28-year-old actors) to mentor contestants in the Hunger Games? Why do they so haphazardly throw together the games? I get that the technology is worse, but they couldn't even clean up the arena the day before the games after it had just been bombed? They couldn't hire more than two Peacekeepers to man the gates? Why does Lucy stop to leave snake traps instead of just escaping? Why do the Peacekeepers gun down multiple contestants who are posing no threat before the games even begin? Why does the main antagonist (Viola Davis) send Snow into the arena to retrieve his friend instead of Peacekeepers who are already at the gates? Whenever they send in donations, the drones accelerate at a dangerous speeds directly into the contestants' faces, and after this happens TWICE even leading to the death of one of the contestants, they still allow this to keep happening to the point that the main character later calls a drone strike that takes out five contestants during a fight, which is deemed totally acceptable.When the love interest girl from District 12 is introduced, she begins singing a song while making overexaggerated facial expressions into the camera, wearing a colorful white dress with a substantial amount of lipstick and makeup. She inexplicably assaults a girl with a snake, which is never mentioned again in the film. And it's later revealed D12 throws frequent musical concerts with high-end guitars, cellos, speakers, and microphones in an underground concert hall, and that they'll sometimes retreat to a lake house wearing comfortable modern swimwear to have fun on vacations. So the people living in the most starved and oppressed district who were fighting tooth and nail for food in the previous movies, living in small, beaten-down wooden buildings, are now living comfortable lifestyles throwing underground Kidz Bop concerts? There's such substantial tonal whiplash that it doesn't even remotely feel like the same universe. How are we supposed to understand these people to be oppressed when every time they're on the screen, they're breaking out into dance and song and going to the lake house for vacations?The music just feels generic-that is, when the movie isn't in musical revolutionary tune mode, at which point you wish Lucy wouldn't overexaggerate every syllable like those Star Spangled Banner performers. The main actor is mediocre and looks/acts like Macklemore with hair that is clearly not naturally blonde. His love interest, coming from extreme poverty, looks, dresses, and acts like a disney princess. The sets are somewhat interesting having a more old-fashioned tone, but it just feels low budget overall, which is surprising considering how this movie had a higher budget than the original Hunger Games. The entire Hunger Games arena was literally just a hastily crafted metal circle. I get these are the days before it was well-developed, but at least give us something. The games didn't feel even remotely dynamic, and the announcer kept saying things at times like ""Oops, we don't have a camera there! We'll add one next year"". Like did they spend any time planning this? While one of the contestants is dying, the announcer is literally reading the weather on the TV. The ending is undercooked and kind of makes sense, but not completely. Everyone kept calling Lucy Gray by her full name. Lucy Gray, Lucy Gray, Lucy Gray-it never ends. And they also kept calling her ""songbird"" (because she sings), which of course sounded completely normal to hear over and over across several characters. The love interest had no character arc and was borderline insufferable, and Snow's character arc didn't really feel natural. It felt like his arc evolved wherever the plot needed to go without making logical sense. And of course the main characters are both orphans because every YA novel aggressively fetishizes having a rough upbringing that have no impact on the story.Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage gave the best performances they could have given the writing. Peter Dinklage hated the main character because he is poor and for no other reason (and again, the author takes any excuse for more oppression fetishization... like it's okay if your character is oppressed, but at least explore it rather than just use it as a cheap, unsuccessful ploy to gain audience sympathy). And Viola Davis was a mad scientist for some reason, whom I think gave the strongest performance in the film, which was impressive considering how they dressed her like a clown. But overall, this movie was so, so much worse than the originals. It didn't really do anything well, including worldbuilding, which I was really anticipating. As a standalone movie, it's entertaining enough to be a 5/10, or maybe a bit higher. But as a sequel to such a fantastic trilogy, it was a colossal disappointment, and I'm extremely disheartened they missed such a great opportunity to build in mature ways on the world of Panam.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","gatorgirlnv","16 November 2023","At a little after two hours (out of 2 hours and 37 minutes of run time), I couldn't stand it anymore and with no end in sight, I left the theater before I fell into a coma. The 10th Hunger Games was the shortest, least interesting and unchallenging of all. I don't think the actual ""game"" even lasted 20 minutes. Gone was all the CGI, the different effects and terrains and all the out-of-nowhere things to challenge the players in addition to the tributes trying to kill each other. I found Rachel Zegler's character, Lucy Gray, annoying at every turn, shallow, not particularly clever, with no real depth or even a back story. I wish they'd just have focused almost entirely on the character of Coriolanus Snow, the mentor, who was very interesting and checked off all the personality points that Lucy Gray didn't. I tried to wait to see how his story played out, but even that wasn't worth waiting for. But, ladies and gentlemen, the first Hunger Games Musical! Zegler can barely get through a scene without bursting into song and her W. Virginia twang in both song and speech is over-the-top fake and gets closer and closer to nails on a chalkboard as the movie goes on. If they left out all the singing, the movie could have probably been a half hour shorter. I love Peter Dinklage, but he looked about as bored as I did. In short, if you're going in there looking for signs or similarities to all the other ""Hunger Games"", skip this because you won't find it. Save yourself the money and time.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","catherinehamel","18 December 2023","It's been a while since I didn't saw a movie I couldn't finish. I was so excited to watch it since I'm a huge fan of hunger game but it was disappointing. The characters are blend, you don't get attached to them, the pace of the movie is weird it's rushed but at the same time nothing happens. The relationship between Snow and Lucy gray was rushed too and so cringe, like girl you don't fall in love after the 2nd time seeing the person that get pay if you don't die.You know the feeling when you wait for the movie to really start but it never really start? I was able to watch half of the movie out of curiosity but couldn't reach the end, it was too hard to watch.I think I'll just read the book at this point after reading some reviews that say that the movie didn't do justice to the book.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","trinaboice","27 November 2023","IN A NUTSHELL:
We get an origin story, of sorts, of President Coriolanus Snow. What the filmmakers are able to show us in only one movie reminded me of Anakin's plunge into the Dark Side that took place in 3 of the Star Wars films.This movie is directed by Francis Lawrence who also directed 3 of the other Hunger Games movies. It's designed as a prequel to the 2012 Hunger Games film. It's supposed to take place 64 years prior.The dramatic film was written by Michael Lesslie, Michael Arndt, and Suzanne Collins. Because they were able to secure an interim agreement from SAG-AFTRA, they were able to market the movie during the 2023 actors' strike.THINGS I LIKED:
Rachel Zegler is so beautiful and has such a lovely voice! She sang all of her songs live on set! I'm excited to see her in Snow White in 2025! She and fellow co-star, Josh Andres Rivera, met while filming the 2021 movie West Side Story together. They're actually dating in real life!Tom Blyth does a great job as Coriolanus Snow. It's fascinating to watch the story unfold when we already know how he ends up in later films. Dexter Sol Answell is completely adorable as the young Coriolanus.Academy Award winner Viola Davis won the role of the villain in this prequel after director Francis Lawrence saw a sinister meme of her that a fan had posted online! She's excellent, of course.I really liked seeing Jason Schwartzman slowly develop the skills he would need later as the flashy Lucretius ""Lucky"" Flickerman.All of the characters are well defined and it's easy to quickly feel something for them. The cast includes Peter Dinklage, Burn Gorman, Fionnula Flanagan, Pliny Harrington, Festus Creed, and many more.The set designs are outstanding.Cool special effects.The movie definitely isn't a musical, yet music plays a big role in the film and perfectly fits the title of the film. I didn't expect to hear so much music in this! I know, that's silly since the word ""ballad"" is in the title! I really enjoyed the musical element in the storyline. It gave a real down-to-earth feeling, and the lyrics showed us how much changed and how much remained the same in the districts.I love that costume designer Trish Summerville included Katniss and Primrose flowers on it as a respectful nod to the previous Hunger Games movies. Nice touch!There are several references to the previous films such as when Lucy Gray curtsies at the ceremony like Katniss did in the 2012 movie.I haven't read the book, but I hear it's a very good adaptation!It's fun to see how the Hunger Games were more amateur in the beginning compared to the glossy veneer they acquired over the decades.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Many of the scenes are visually dark, so it'll be hard to see everything that's going on if you watch this on a small streaming device once the film goes to Video on Demand.It seemed ridiculous that Lucy Gray Baird had a beautiful, colorful, and expensive-looking dress while living in a poor district. It was pretty though!Some of the actors deliver lines mechanically.It drove me nuts when Lucy Gray Baird would just sit instead of run away. She seemed super cocky considering she wasn't a very good fighter.All of the characters looked normal, but Viola Davis was so over the top and seemed out of place.While the movie is a prequel to the original trilogy, it's not an origin story of the actual Hunger Games.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Violence with various weapons and hand-to-hand combat
Explosions and destruction
Some blood and gore
We see people die.If you don't like snakes, you're going to be very uncomfortable watching some of the scenes.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","cowboywayfest","20 November 2023","After the trilogy we were really looking forward to this prequel. If you're wanting the excitement of the trilogy this is a fail. If you're looking for the love story, this is a fail. And if you're looking for a political statement amongst the story this is extremely weak though not a total fail. Don't expect any pomp and circumstances or fantastic outfits either.The characters are shallow, the story line even more so. The angst doesn't come through.It's clear from the get go what motivates Snow--self preservation. Period. But we already knew that from the trilogy. Duh. He didn't wrestle with any moral or ethical questions whatsoever although the weak attempts alluding to such. He has always been an a$$hat.And the son of Plinth?! Srsly unbelievable considering his background and upbringing. And to think that Daddy didn't even attempt to bail him out a last time?! Nawh dawwg. Not buying it.Almost no development of any of the tribute ""players"". You don't really have anyone but Ms. Gray to root for. And what IS the deal of always using her full name? It's stupid.Acting is very good, as it should be. Effects are few but well done. The weatherman/emcee is the only real connection to what we saw in the trilogy and yet still incomplete.Overall disappointed, would rather have seen it at home.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Aegelis","28 November 2023","An epic character story, Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes gets closer to the origin of how this post-apocalyptic future happens through the eyes of president-to-be Snow. Dramatic elements are heavy, intrigue abounds, politics play their part, and the action sequence provides a hefty dose of tension.Actors/Actresses were the highlight of the film for me, with captivating believability, emotion, and expression. Directing was a close second. CGI was obvious but not as off-putting as earlier 2000s films. A few questionable events at the end were head-scratchers and overall think the film would've been better finished at the climax rather than the downward slope. Still, a very enjoyable movie.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","sherylchilders82","23 November 2023","I've read the Hunger Games trilogy several times, including the audiobooks in anticipation of this film. I purposefully did not read the book for this movie, because I like to read the books after. While the rating seems good, I'm not understanding the large number of negative reviews.The Hunger Games is YA - it seems a lot of people are expecting something different. The school setting of the trainers and Viola Davis's character felt very appropriate for the genre, and so did the immature characters. The melodrama between them, and the general focus was exactly as expected. The movie has a PG-13 rating, so while it is a dark story, the violence is toned down. This is not Game of Thrones, despite Peter Dinklage being there. I suspect the lack of intensity might have been an issue in expectations for some. In addition, the games themselves are only one part, rather than the main focus of the film. This is not a sequel meant to relive the original trilogy. Those books and movies stand alone. That saga is complete.However, if you focus on the message and themes, much of the story is actually very striking. Snow is a realistic villain, which is exactly the point. It also occurs in the time of his life when these character developments really occur. He is never a completely sympathetic character because that would not be believable. From the beginning, we can see that he is strategizing more than caring, in contrast to many of his classmates, especially his friend, Plinth. In fact, he is a star mentor right away, attracting the attention of the head game maker, played by Viola Davis. The story is well crafted, and I'm so excited to now fill in the blanks by reading the book. There are indeed hints at unanswered questions.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","jazzsp8-94-555706","27 December 2023","I'm at best a casual Hunger Games fan. I've watched them because my wife wanted to, not normally my thing at all. I eye rolled when told they'd made a prequel.BUT - I'll hold my hands up, I enjoyed it more than I thought.Seeing how Snow becomes the man we know from the later films was quite enjoyable, I get what others are saying about the ending seeming quite rushed when we start to see his true colours though. I think I'd have enjoyed a more nuanced approach to this. But it really didn't ruin anything the way it was done.I see a lot of complaints complaining that it wasn't a faithful adaption of the book. I've never read the book so I can't speak to that but I can count on one hand the amount of books I've read that have been faithfully translated to screen - It almost never happens the way that satisfies everyone, people should be used to that by now.As for the songs been complained about, well perhaps they should try listening to them - I thought they helped convey a lot of narrative and emotion and the film would be missing something more without them. And for those comparing this to a musical because of them, then they should probably go and watch a musical to find out how wrong they are there as well. Ridiculous statements.Was / is it the best film ever? No. Of course not.Does it deserve the panning some people give it based on it not being an accurate representation of the book? Nope.Does it deserve to be slagged off for being a musical? Nope.Does it deserve a watch if you've any interest in the Hunger Games world? Absolutely.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","DanLawson146","17 November 2023","POSITIVES:1) I thought all of the central performances were excellent. They made all of the main characters feel very engaging and I was locked in for the whole film
2) I loved the darkness of the film and of this series in general. It feels right on the border between a film for teens and a film for adults and I think that's a really good place to be. The inner turmoil and conflict that the two leads feel throughout the film is very powerful, as well as the outer turmoil and conflict that is happening throughout the events of the film
3) The production of the film was really high class. The cinematography, score etc clearly had a lot of budget and effort put into themNEGATIVES:1) I did find the film a bit too cringey at times. The singing was too much for me for starters - if it was once or twice it would've been powerful but it happens so often that it becomes sickly. Also Snow's classmates were all just cliché bullies which felt cringey and predictable
2) The end felt very rushed to me, despite the film being over two and a half hours it still felt like it needed more time to wrap things up properly. Snow and Lucy Gray becoming enemies felt out of nowhere and the film leaves more questions than it answers. What happened to Lucy Gray? What are the after effects of Highbottom dying? What happens with the seeming conflict between Snow and Tigriss?3) There were too many references to the original series that felt far too on the nose. I actually thought hearing The Hanging Tree and hearing President Snow's voice at the end were both good call backs, but the references to Katniss and to the Mockingjays were far too on the nose for me.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","lindhardt09","17 February 2024","The acting was mostly alright, but sometimes felt a little forced. To me the worst part was that the most important scene near the end was changed taking away all the power from the main female character. She ended up feeling empty and utterly useless. She couldn't have even been used as eye candy by that point since her camera angles always seemed to catch her in the most unappealing light they possibly could. The other power scenes for the female characters were all ruined for me since it seemed like they over played them times to try to stick it to the man moments. While they were those types of moments, as soon as an actor tries too hard to make it appear that, it has lost all it's power for me.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ta-98251","18 November 2023","The Hunger Games movies, for the most part, have been well made and faithful adaptations of the books. So when I turned the final page of Hunger Games: The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes, I was looking forward to the movie much more than I expected to before I started reading the book.Thankfully The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes is another strong and faithful adaptation. We return to the capital 65 years before the events of original Hunger Games films and a few years after the Panem Civil War. We meet a young Cornelius Snow shortly before he and his Capitol class mates mentor tributes in the 10th Annual Hunger Games. We then embark on a three part character study.Firstly, the Capitol looked great. It's not the over the top, bright, excessive and indulgent Capitol we are used to. It's dark and gritty but also a futuristic city seeking to make technological advances. There are times when the CGI is shaky for example when we see cockroaches, rats or explosions but otherwise the film looks great. I especially enjoyed some of the camera work and the interesting use of angles that brought us closer to the action.Viola Davis and Pinter Dinklage were excellent in their roles as Dr Gaul and Dean Highbottom whilst Jason Schwartzman was fantastic as Lucky Flickerman, the movie's only comic relief as weatherman and host of the Hunger Games. The two leads will likely draw several different opinions. They weren't perfect but still had aspects that worked. Tom Blyth played a good Cornelius Snow although it is hard not to think about how majestic Donald Sutherlund is as a older more Powerful Snow. Rachel Zeglar has a great voice which is fully on display as Songbird Lucy Grey Baird, the female tribute from District 12. I wasn't fully sold on other aspects of her performance. That being said, If I had to recast one character in the Hunger Games franchise it would still be Peeta. The chemistry between the leads was questionable at times but perhaps that is to be expected when a boy from the Capitol meets a girl from District 12?I enjoyed the story when I read the book and it was represented well on screen. The movie builds on the lore of The Hunger Games and especially the background of Cornelius Snow in a way that helps us to interpret the originally trilogy in a much more profound way. Director Francis Lawrence originally wanted to split the movie in two but I'm glad it ended up being one movie. However, this resulted in a runtime of 2 hours 37 minutes. The movie squeezed a lot into this time which mostly worked well although there were a couple of instances where I questioned things which happened on screen which I didn't question when reading the book because I had more information available to me at the time. So those who haven't read the book may find it stuffed and the weight of certain scenes may not have the intended impact.The action is fun and brutal at times. At no point did I feel as if they we were catering to a younger audience. This Hunger Games was set in standard oval stadium in the times before the elaborate settings of the future games. This resulted in a larger focus on close combat and hiding which I enjoyed.Overall, The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes is another well adapted Hunger Games movie. Its dark, gritty and more importantly it tells a standalone story but also a story that enhances our understanding of Cornelius Snow and allows us to view the original trilogy in a way that adds additional layers to the viewing experience. It's a long film and has a lot going on which may not cater to everybody. Highly recommended to fans of the Hunger Games.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","view_and_review","26 February 2024","I never had plans to see the ""Hunger Games"" prequel. After ""The Hunger Games"" wrapped up with Mockingjay, I was done. I wasn't terribly impressed with the Mockingjay book or the movie. Then my daughters told me how good it was.OK, I'll bite.""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is an origin story of Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth), later to be known as President Snow. When he was a youngster the districts went to war with the capital and lost, which gave birth to the Hunger Games. It was the Capital's way of punishing the districts for their rebellion.Snow was a small boy during the war, and a teenager in school when the Hunger Games were being ""played."" At that time the Hunger Games viewership was beginning to wane and Dr. Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis), the gamemaster, wanted to do something to increase viewership. To do that, the upper class Capital students would have to be mentors to the newest batch of selectees for the tenth annual Hunger Games. Snow got Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler) from District 12.Snow had more of an incentive than any other student to succeed with his underling. He and his family were totally broke and the Plinth Prize money was the only thing that could save them from homelessness and humiliation. He poured everything into helping the soulful Lucy Gray, but was it out of love, selfishness, or both?Even though ""Songbirds & Snakes"" was two hours and forty-five minutes long, it was enjoyable. I think I looked at my watch once towards the end. They somehow were able to make the actual Hunger Games (meaning the fight to survive) interesting though it was cruder and more rudimentary. Maybe my memory has failed me, but the prequel seemed more vicious, violent, and cutthroat. And that wasn't a bad thing. The performances were great and I think it even evoked more of an emotional response from the viewer. Snow was a mercurial character--sympathetic at times, cunning, smart, and maybe a little sinister. He was worth watching.","

This made me think of ""Logan's Run"" (yes, I'm old), which is a compliment I guess... kind of.I particularly enjoyed each time we see Mr. Hottie show off his impeccable torso and abs (5 times in about 2 hours and 30mn, it must have been in his contract). At that point I also decided to mindlessly enjoy the ineffable Peter Dinklage (not his torso and abs though). I felt some schadenfreude at seeing him go through the motions of a Song of Ice and F..., er, a Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, heartily quaffing wine while philosophizing about the Snow family. Good old times... Speaking of which, what kind of name is Coriolanus Snow?? Ah well, rather than try to make sense of the Shakespearean ref I heartily enjoyed all the wordplays and witty metaphors based on snow (""Snow always lands on top""). Finally the subtle Christian imagery (he gets bitten by a snake, get it???) revealed this flick to be a deep meditation on good and evil in this fallen world of ours, human nature, and white teeth. Especially white teeth.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","yixiansyx","17 December 2023","What a horrible movie. I expected the hunger games and some singing like the iconic song but this was something else and not in a good way.It seemed more like a movie about a country singer, which is fine but don't call it the hunger games. The characters were weakly developed and the story was miserable. It was hard to empathize with anyone in the movie and honestly quite boring.They could've taken the time to develop the characters but instead wasted all the time on lengthy singing. I get that singing is essential but there's simply too much of it for a movie like the hunger games.Not a movie to watch in the cinema. Just wait for it to stream.","

There is non acting talent and love for acting this is pure chase of fame and money !!!In general the movie could be done in more depth slower pase and possibly to make it two parts. Better cast with people full with natural talant and love for acting. There are a lot of young actresses which could do the job better!!","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","ryandsingh","1 January 2024","Sorry but the other 4 movies were wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better. I fell asleep in the movie theater and was disappointed I didn't watch this online. Honestly it was boring and didn't keep me interested, although I tried hard. The other 4 movies had more essence, a better storyline, more attention to detail and a better understanding of the outlines of the games. The Spanish actress who played the girl who sang country music was not good. Her singing was the only thing that appealed. Viola Davis was just ok as the previous Elizabeth Banks. Not good enough. The Snow guy looked like Ryan Gosling, but overall this movies was not in any comparison of the previous. I hope they don't make a sequel, it's just doing harm.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","yespat","22 November 2023","Because of the good reviews, I thought I'd take a chance on this. It was surprisingly entertaining except it seemed they couldn't find a way to turn the young Snow into a villain without an idiot plot point.Everything made sense until he was sent into the ring to save his friend. He asked his superior to send in the ""peacekeepers"" but was told that the cameras were on and the public didn't want to see them in there. Then the young Snow was told that the cameras would be off when he went in to retrieve his friend so there would be no record of his entering the ring. After he went in, he killed one of the contestants out of seeming rage though, at that moment, he had more relief at safely retrieving his friend than anger so powerful that he could kill someone.Those 2 idiot plot points allowed him to lie to his girlfriend and ultimately lead her to not trust him and leave him. Had he never killed that contestant, he would have not had an opportunity to lie to his girlfriend and they would have escaped to the north, free. There would never have been a grown up mean Snow, thus no future Hunger Games movies featuring Snow.The other troublesome part was how, when the young lovers stumbled upon a cabin, how was it that the guns made it in there before they got there? And how did she know the guns were in there?So, there were a few things that, i think had they cleaned them up, would have made for a really great movie. As it was, what they ended up with was a movie that was a better than expected sequel (that is a prequel.). So i gave it a rating of 6.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","pedroquintaoo","16 November 2023","This prequel presents a remarkable first part that successfully revives the compelling elements of ""The Hunger Games"" saga, evoking excitement through the portrayal of tributes, the inhumane Capitol management, and poignant metaphors. The smaller arena contributes to an intense atmosphere, maintaining a delicate balance between avoiding explicit deaths and ensuring a family-friendly rating. The contextualization of the early games adds an intriguing layer, highlighting the evolution from the initial to the final games in the original saga.The protagonists, notably Lucy and the nuanced portrayal of the young President Snow, add depth and memorability to the narrative. Despite limited development, secondary characters establish a connection with the audience, eliciting a range of emotions. The film introduces a darker atmosphere not present in the original saga, with memorable scenes like the eerie mockingjays repeating the last words before public executions.However, the second part, while interesting for narrative development, feels rushed, leaving room for a more thorough exploration of characters and consequences. This critique suggests that splitting the narrative into two films could have enhanced the depth of the second part, allowing for additional scenes to intensify the storyline. The justifications for President Snow's personality change, although present, are portrayed quickly and lack convincing depth. Despite these shortcomings, the film stands out for its impactful first part, rivaling or even surpassing key scenes from the original two films.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","nurihelvali","16 December 2023","Personally, I can say as a Hunger Games fan that it's a complete disaster. Normally, it's a perfect series with both a strong plot and an original old film, but this new film is both empty and long. Moreover, the atmosphere is so different that it seems a lot has changed in 65 years (compared to the original film). There's no similarity in the setting, and I find the setting quite dull; it's a major mistake.Characters: The actors weren't bad at their jobs, but they weren't good either. Definitely, the acting in the first film was much better. I can say that the actors were a bit inexperienced, and especially, they couldn't convey fear. There were no scared expressions on their faces; it was as if they were playing a little charming game.And finally, thanks to them for ruining the perfection and indispensability of the film.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","sweetest-kait","8 December 2023","Hey, I'm a faithful Hunger Games fan (original series), but I was so moved by my distaste for this story that I needed to leave a review.First, not only was I uninterested in reading the book version of this story, but I was pretty horrified to see/try to understand what the point of it was. The story starts with Snow's family being broke because people stopped watching the hunger games (good), and am I supposed to enjoy watching him slowly devolve? His sister literally gives him the permission not to be a bad person, and he chooses to be one for no apparent reason? Just cuz? None of the classically justifiable villain origin story tropes happen to this kid to make me care that he's evil. He's just bad, and continues to choose to be bad for power's sake (boring). In my opinion, he was bad at the beginning and as soon as he enjoyed/definitely didn't hate doing murder, it just got worse.Second, this is the kind of romantic relationship that one would have in college. He's hot, he'll ruin your life, he'll make you think you're being protected until you break free and someday start writing slam poetry to process your trauma. So, good for her for cutting and running (although not soon enough imo). Her instincts were good at least.Lastly, GOD it was so uncomfortable to watch near the end. When he's just running through the woods with a machine gun because his feelings were hurt I couldn't help but think, ""oh god, this is my worst nightmare and also I hope nobody who sees this will think of him as their hero."" They will. Someone always will. Why do people waste their time telling stories about these characters? Even worse, with no character development. I don't mind watching someone be evil on screen, but give me a ray of hope.Baseline, I don't care about President Snows origin story. I don't care that he was young once. I don't care that he had a family. I don't even care that he was maybe in something like love. Tell me a story about someone who is challenged and GROWS and changes. That's the kind of story we need right now. Not this.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","HalBanksy","21 November 2023","I read this book when it first released - found it quite muddled and underwhelming, then quickly forgot it. I feel the same about the film. Entertaining enough and watchable, but nothing blew me away. There's just a spark that is missing. Also the characters repeat each others (unbearably annoying) names every 10 seconds - this got very old very fast..The first two Hunger Games films were really elevated by inspired casting choices. Nobody here is close to that level except Viola Davis who steals each of her scenes. She adds much needed charisma and camp energy to this rather flat group of actors. It's actually the kind of performance that could have saved the mediocre Mockingjay films, instead of whatever Julianne Moore was doing.The lead couple's lack of chemistry here actually makes their scenes quite confusing. It was difficult to understand what motivated their actions, especially towards the end. Peter Dinklage is very poor, blatantly bored with this script and just cashing a cheque.Overall it was fun, but I think this could have worked much better as a television series. Dividing each of the three parts of the film into a few hour long episodes would have given some room for the narrative to breathe and build empathy for these characters.","

Does this explore how the games began? Or is it about something else? .. Well, it's unclear till the end and after.Hated how they made this into a musical and how the film didn't delve as deeply into Coryo's close bond with his mom as the book did. In the book, Ma Plinth is portrayed as a sweet and nurturing mother figure who practically adopts him into the family, providing him with food and support. Her role makes Coryo's betrayal of Sejanus and his eventual demise even more heartbreaking.Yes, there is something that I liked; decent/promising casting.","

The scenes, the cinematography and the dialogue feel like a 10 year old made the script and put it together overnight. The actors tried their best, but its not their fault the movie is absolute garbage. It was sad to see Peter Dinklage's talent get wasted on this movie. I think the worst part of the movie is how slow and un-interesting everything was.There was so much potential, and after 11 years from the original 2012 movie, this is absolutely pathetic sequel or prequel.Don't recommend to watch even if your life depends on it.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","vjzrkvqjq","22 December 2023","If you're going to make a Hunger Games movie, please make it at least relating to the original series. Before watching the movie, I told my friends we shouldn't watch it as the trailer already looked lame, then we watched the movie and I was right! It felt like a romance movie with the hunger games in the background. No scenes made me emotional, I wanted to go home the first hour but stayed so I could laugh at the stupidity of it. When Katniss sang Hanging Tree in Mockingjay, I wanted to cry. The rawness of her voice and not trying to sound amazing but wanting to portray an emotion of death and sadness was incredible, you can literally hear it. This time around, it was sang as if she was auditioning for Americans Got Talent. I understand it's ""The Ballad of the Songbirds"" but it's at that point just make it a musical. This shouldnt be part of the OG hunger games series as the games only lasted like an hour out of 2.5 hours of the movie lol. Plus, watching it felt like they were in costumes, idk just me? Like I didnt notice it as much during the other movies because everything just made sense. Anyways, im giving it a 3/10 because it COULDVE been worst, but I don't recommend this to real Hunger Games fans.","

Buckle up, folks - we're in for a lukewarm journey.Coriolanus Snow's transformation is like watching a caterpillar attempt ballet - ambitious but fundamentally awkward. Tom Blyth and Viola Davis give stellar performances, though it feels a bit like winning an Oscar for a school play. And that brief love story? It's the spice equivalent of saltine crackers - a bit bland.Now, the characters. Picture a group of friends you wouldn't invite to your birthday party. That's them. More background and growth? Apparently, that's too much to ask. The pacing is so off; I thought I accidentally switched to 'Hunger Games: The Slow Motion Edition.' Trim it? More like perform a cinematic exorcism.Rachel Zegler's acting is stiffer than a frozen baguette, and the singing scenes? It's like they handed out microphones at a karaoke night for tone-deaf cats. The connection to the original Hunger Games series is shakier than my Wi-Fi during a storm.'The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes' has its moments, like finding a semi-interesting receipt in your wallet - mildly intriguing, but hardly a jackpot. If they iron out these wrinkles, maybe the next chapters will be less like a kiddie ride and more like a rollercoaster with actual loops.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","bussinworker","1 January 2024","You can find a review on this everywhere else I will skip to what I felt could have been so interesting and was missed out on.This story has always had deep themes around class warfare, dystopian government, mankind's ability to separate people and make Others Inhuman and able to be treated as cattle. So I think one big missed opportunity is with the plot around the Mentor Program and Corio Snow. Something that has always stuck with me are the servant master relationships we hear about during the American Slavery period. Famously, Thomas Jefferson had a very romantic time with one of his slaves. There should have been more about Lucy Gray, what does she really feel, does she feel grateful? Do they really fall in love or is she playing him? Yes there is that in the beginning but the movie never has the guts to say, these people are in a deep love for each other even though its a sick relationship with an extreme power imbalance. Perhaps they could show her having the power over a foolish Snow. She gets him to rig the games for her and yet has a soft spot for him by the end. Snow could be scandalized by being shown addicted to his ""lesser human"" girlfriend and therefore his cheating allegations and exile would impact him because he would be deeply grieving feeling that he would never see Lucy again. Lots of ways they could go with this.Also there is just not enough done with the 1960s TV premise. What if this was the first Games in Color? People in The Capital would see the red blood of kids for the first time, would that make a difference on how Panem sees the kids? So many characters could bring you a deep feeling through their eyes of seeing all this awful trauma.How Snow relates to the people on District 12 how it made him change The Hunger Games in how he did how it made him see the people of Panem as human beings and yet how he rationalized seeing himself as worthy of dominating and controlling them at the end, is stuff that can take the viewers on a ride of terror and imagination.The premise, theme, storyline and dialogues of this movie in the right hands are Oscar winning. Too bad they failed on most execution. Another movie that could be life changing wasted in the Hollywood machine. At least it was watchable and had some cool world building so 5/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","southdavid","8 January 2024","Having seen, but never been a particularly big fan of ""The Hunger Games"" movies, I almost didn't go and see his prequel. But it worked out timewise, and I really want to make a concerted effort to see more films at the cinema this year, so I decided to risk it. I was surprisingly impressed with how complex the descent of Snow was handled.With his family near destitute, Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) is banking on graduating from the academy with the prestigious Plinth Prize, which would solve his families' problems. However, at the last moment he, and the rest of this class, are tasked with a final assignment. They each have to mentor a competitor in this years Hunger Games, the 10th annual event, the future of which is in doubt as people have stopped watching. Snow is placed with Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler) a musical performer from district 12, who is charismatic and personable, but lacking the heart for the violence to come.So, I remembered enough to know that Snow would go on to be the President and antagonist of the later films, so I knew roughly where we were heading. I was surprised at how slowly paced and ... justifiable even ... the stages of his compromised heel turn were. I understand he's more of a monster from the beginning in the book and some people criticised this adaptation for that, but this has to be a more interesting way to go, and Tom Blyth does a good job of keeping things balanced. I liked a lot of the performances, with Viola Davis going big as the current games organiser and Peter Dinklage in a role that becomes more sympathetic as the films goes on.I don't think I'd argue against the film's other criticism though, that's it's long. I did feel its two and half hour run time. With the Hunger Games themselves competed around the halfway point in the film. I'd also say we could have done with a little more differentiation between the other competitors as I often wasn't sure who was who.I don't want to go overboard and over praise a film which does have some issues, but given I had almost no expectation going on, that it was a surprisingly complex and accomplished film, was a nice surprise.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","big-sky14","20 January 2024","The major beats of the book plot play out more or less exactly as written here in the movie. It falls flat because the author decided this story required ""adult pathos"" to justify its existence, and, most unfortunately, writes that pathos like a 12 year old making their first big foray into Wattpad. Other than a few vaguely satisfying beats in the (very short) Games sequence, there's nothing here but incredibly amateurish melodrama, and that's all true-to-text.All the best parts of the political intrigue and action/adventure that make the first trilogy so engaging are completely absent, or present only as cameo-style, utterly embarrassing call-backs to those 10-year-old stories that actually interested you. The romance was the worst part of the original series, but here you're begging for it because if it's not the current on-screen focus then you're probably watching a bizarre musical theater kid wet dream where Everybody Has To Stop And Be Impressed By Your Heartfelt Singing That Happens To Be Precisely Suited To The Collective Emotional Moment And Isn't That So Cool. There are literally five or six EXTENDED musical sequences that serve absolutely no plot function, but are wielded by the author like plot points nonetheless, because she's got nothing else to offer while moving the story forward.This flick may not actually be 525,600 minutes long but you could sure fool me by the end. Hard pass.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","lahiru-61317","25 December 2023","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" falls short of the high expectations set by its predecessors. Despite its attempt to delve into the origin story of President Snow, the film struggles to captivate audiences. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of exposition that lack the gripping tension characteristic of the franchise.The choice to center the narrative around a young Snow feels misguided. While exploring the evolution of a villain can be intriguing, the execution here feels forced and fails to humanize the character. Donald Sutherland's charismatic portrayal in the earlier films is sorely missed, leaving a void that the new lead fails to fill convincingly.The film's production design is commendable, successfully recreating the dystopian world of Panem. However, the visual elements alone cannot compensate for the weak character development and a lackluster script. The absence of a strong female protagonist akin to Katniss Everdeen is particularly noticeable, depriving the story of the resilience and depth that defined the previous installments.Furthermore, the film's attempt to provide social commentary on privilege and power lacks subtlety, coming across as heavy-handed and didactic. The subtleties that made the original trilogy thought-provoking are sacrificed for a more straightforward narrative, diminishing the intellectual engagement that characterized earlier films.Despite a few redeeming moments, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" ultimately fails to capture the essence of its predecessors. Fans of the franchise may find it disappointing, as it struggles to live up to the legacy established by the original trilogy. While the film has its merits, it pales in comparison to the thought-provoking and emotionally resonant storytelling that made ""The Hunger Games"" a cultural phenomenon.","

But a few things were difficult to watch. Primarily that Lucy Gray was not the protagonist this series deserved. From a wavering southern bell accent (which vacillated wildly) to the near musical territory the movie wandered into, this HG prequel felt like a very long made for premium streaming exclusive. Redemption comes from Tom Blythe, who was phenomenal, but the third act dragged heavily and I found myself asking why he looked like Eminem in District 12. The odd love story between Snow and Gray wasn't helped by the sort of Gypsy bard rebel played by Rachel Zegler.The movie had its moments but I was personally removed from the story every time Zegler had a different accent or used some southern turn of phrase. To me it just fell flat but made canonical sense in what really happened to Snow that sent him down his capital path.","

Unfortunately, my caution was warranted. The film, from start to finish, felt like a tedious journey through a poorly constructed narrative.First and foremost, the characters in this iteration lacked depth and credibility. Their motivations were unclear, and their actions often felt random, contributing to a disjointed storyline. It was as if the script was generated by an AI like ChatGPT, lacking the human touch that usually brings characters to life.The overall quality of the film was underwhelming. From the CGI effects to the set design, everything seemed to be done with minimal effort and creativity. The dialogues were particularly disappointing, often bordering on nonsensical, which further detached me from the story.Moreover, the plot itself was a letdown. It neither honored the original Hunger Games spirit nor offered anything new or exciting. It was as if the producers simply relied on the franchise's name to carry the movie, without putting in the necessary work to make it stand out.In conclusion, Hunger Games is a forgettable addition to the franchise. It's a stark reminder that not all sequels or spin-offs live up to their names. For future projects, I hope more attention is given to developing engaging characters and a compelling narrative, the very elements that made the original Hunger Games so captivating.","

The cast is well-done and the story overall isn't like Hunger Games 2 where it was just more or less a replay of Hunger Games 1. I like how the background is constructed in a way that gives information without going through endless boring plots and side plots of characters that aren't memorable.I would have given it a 9/10 (tying my rating for the original) if the ending was better linked to the first Hunger Games. While, a lot is implied by how the movie ends. I would have liked more linkage on Snow's health issues in the Mockingjay movies where he had poisoned himself in order to poison and kill all his enemies. Whether it be by the way he did in this movie or some other method, there should have been more hints that he was willing to hurt himself to wipe out all his enemies. Unless they are planning to make a sequel to the prequel, I think they could have added about 5 minutes of screen time to explain how exactly he became President Snow.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","dmay-76183","20 January 2024","Brutally long and uninspiring movie. The lead character is unbearable to watch. Her accent is something like an O'l southern accent mixed with a really poor Irish accent. Her facial expressions, and unnecessary singing made me ask myself several times how much longer is this movie. The worst part is I bought it instead of renting it.I enjoyed all of the other hunger games movies, the acting was better, the characters had better chemistry, the storyline flowed better. I don't know if they are going to make more movies to follow this one. However if they do I hope they get a new cast and director.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","AxrnW","20 November 2023","I was waiting for this movie for so long because of the backlash that Rachel Zegler had - due to her remarks about the previous Snow white movie - and I was waiting for her to prove how fantastic she is and how the world was putting her in a bad light for simply having an opinion!She proved that she is an outstanding actor, who has magnetism and beautiful vocals!I never read the book, but thoroughly enjoyed the other movies and now I feel as though this movie was one of my favourites, it interesting to learn how the whole games started off and how it became televised to the people of the Capitol.President Snows - younger back story - was also very interesting to discover and shows the viewers how he became as cold as his last name states.It's funny how love can make you go crazy and risk it all...But also risking it all for someone and then showing your true colours.. and then realising you didn't truly even know one another, when it's too late, can also make you go a bit insane also,Snow felt as though he wasted his time and energy and I get that, but he was never going to last with Lucy as she had a totally different, free-spirited mindset that would never have obided by the capitols rules.Very interesting story, go see it!!","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","vggnwmh","25 November 2023","Disjointed, unclear motivation, mannequins for characters, overly long. I had a real hard time following the evolving motivation of Snow and part three left me scratching my head. He betrays the rebels, acts in their defense and then .... I don't really know. The near final scene set near the cabin on the lake was emblematic of the disjointed story line. Snows final emergence as the cold villain we know from the sequels is not convincing. A waste of a few hours. Some good performances scattered throughout, Dinklage is solid as usual and the game show host is fun and Viola Davis's wardrobe and make up is the best thing about the movie.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","bm230199","17 November 2023","I think the best way to describe this film is disjointed. It felt like they spent too little time on each of the characters but at the same time scenes seemed to drag on and the dialogue was boring. There was no chemisry between the two main characters and their romance was high unbelievable but is the main point of the film. It jumps from the capitol, to the games, to district 12 so much I can't help but think it would've been better as a tv show so it could've properly been broken down into different parts. Some things were just highly unrealistic too such as a bunch of Capitol studens chanting to free a tribute? Never going to happen. Also Lucy trying to kiss Snow within what a daty of meeting him? Also how was there so little fighting or action in a film about people fighting to the death? Some plot points just didn't make sense like how on earth Snow sent a bird with his friend confessing treason then being upset when his friend was killed to the last 30 minutes of the film where the characers did a 360 and admitted killing people without telling us who. It had good potential and I liked he easter eggs to the later movies but overall missed the mark for me. Just go see The Marvels instead.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","leadinglimbou","17 November 2023","Honestly, I made an IMDb account to write a review for this movie after reading some other ones. Saw it opening night and I think it might be one of my favorite movies of the year. The casting was amazing, the story was super close to the book, the music beautiful. Everything about this movie was really well done. I read a couple of other reviews and I have to say that most who don't like this movie seem to never have like the hunger games in the first place. If you are a hunger games fan I really believe you'll enjoy this movie. The acting was superb -Snow was incredible and so was Lucy. I give it a 9/10 because there were some parts where it felt a little gimmicky and it was on the longer side. Overall, a super enjoyable movie. I'd definitely recommend if you liked anything about the original hunger games (books or movies). Idk how these reviews work but if you can lmk what you think.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","eve_dolluk","11 December 2023","The first Hunger Games with Jennifer Lawrence was a very good film. It was fresh and new and Katniss Everdeen was a great movie character.A side character in that trilogy ( 4 films ) was President Snow, this film is a prequel to the original films showing him in his youth before his rise to power.The film is split into 3 parts.Part 1 - is an introduction to Snow and his friends/fellow students and also the tributes of the 10th hunger games.Part 2 - is the 10th Hunger games
Part 3 - is how Snow starts his journey to becoming the looming dictator he becomes in the OT.This is why the film really fails to deliver.Part 1 is lacking in development and introduces way to many characters although the focus here is Snow and Lucy Gray Baird, her first name is ' Lucy Gray ' not just Lucy.Played by Rachel Zegler she is the antipathy of Katniss, her strengths are singing and charm centred around an aloof but colourful character.Of course Snow is mesmerised.Part 2 centres around the 10th Hunger games where viewing figures and interest have been waning to the point this could be the last. Thats right the central part of this show is just how lacklustre the Hunger Games have become. A fairly small old building is the arena for this and yes its dull and boring, this makes what should be a beautiful climax, just seem lifeless.Part 3 is a long winded prologue covering punishment for Snow his ostracism from the capitol and then his return... by this point however you may have stopped caring.Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage appear fleetingly, Viola steals the limelight every time. Tom Blyth is good as Snow, a snakey but transient young man. Zegler uses her singing talents well but is more of a romantic supporting interest than a winning hero.Dinklage I felt was underused as were the majority of the rest of the cast.Overall there is an interesting story there but it wasn't told in an interesting way and I can't think of any really good or stand out re watchable moments. It was very studio set/green screen throughout and it felt like there was little chemistry between the actors.A 5 or 6 out of 10 for me.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","parksiet","17 November 2023","The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is by far one of the best entries in The Hunger Games franchise! A perfect adaptation of the novel, it expands on its dark dystopian world with rich costumes, stunning art direction, an epic score, and a sense of scale and scope that's fitting for this prequel about the rise of President Snow. And it's so much richer than dystopian young adult adaptations are usually ever allowed to be! I'm struggling to remember the last time a prequel was this much better and more interesting than the rest of its franchise. I love the nuanced, darker story that is more of a character study than anything which was so well executed by returning director Francis Lawrence in this colder prequel. He brought new life to the franchise with his masterful take on Catching Fire, and did it once again with The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, delivering a darker, more sinister version of the Games through Snow's perspective that is ten times better than it has any right to be.Significantly more intimate and grounded than the previous Hunger Games movies (despite being longer than any of them and responsible for seeding all of their lore), The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is the rare prequel that manages to stand on its own two feet and still feel taller than the other stories it's ultimately meant to support.But the real star is the cast. They crush it. Rachel Zegler truly shines and is super captivating in this. If you thought she was good in West Side Story, just wait until you see her here! Plus she gets to show off her incredible singing skills multiple times! I really loved her here, she truly is a star on the rise. Her character Lucy Gray is very different from Katniss, (Katniss was a fighter forced to perform, Lucy Gray is a performer forced to fight) and the tense, twisty dynamics between Lucy and Tom Blyth's Coriolanus are a treat to watch. Tom Blyth is a standout, selling Snow's moral ambiguity/decay with such a subtle, nuanced, and gifted performance. Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage are powerhouses and wildly compelling, as they usually are. Davis' character in particular is so devious, and it's so marvelous to watch. Plus this film has one of the 3 best Jason Schwartzman performances of the year - he's hilarious in this!With high stakes, solid action, and killer performances, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a thrilling return to Panem, assisted by some excellent production design and the return of memorable motifs/themes in the musical score. I love that so many people who worked on the original films came back for this one, really helping to make it all feel cohesive with the other films (especially thanks to James Newton Howard's excellent score)! This is purely grand, epic storytelling. It's long for sure, but doesn't drag. It works well by doing something fairly different from the first series, taking on a unique story structure that most studios would try to separate into a two-part movie. But I'm so glad they didn't split this up, and it still came out as such a faithful adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel. I loved this film! My sister, who doesn't love movies, loved this film (said it's the longest she's ever been compelled by a movie)! It's genuinely a very fair candidate for the best film in The Hunger Games franchise, either as good as or better than Catching Fire! The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a magnificent film that not only excels in its own right, but also enriches the original franchise that is it now a part of. If you loved The Hunger Games, you can't miss this!It's the things we love most that destroy us.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","wkasprzyk","20 November 2023","The movie notably centers on Rachel Zegler, who appears to excel in every aspect. She portrays the most kindness, despite becoming from occupied district, winning without resorting to combat and effortlessly dodging crossbow bolts, she takes care of friend and even shares Snow's food with Snow... She sings the best and she can do it strong and proud even snakes seem to kill her in the moment.Regrettably, the first two acts lack bright sides, offering only mediocre or subpar elements. Mediocre music - bad plot; mediocre dialogs - bad characters; mediocre locations - bad jokes.The third act, while an improvement, feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the movie. In the end, the events that unfold don't even matter, because the clue is that Snow was always playing hardball.Anyway I can blind the eye to this nonsens and plot pointlessness and still rate it 3 starts, primarily due to the notable improvement in the third act..","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","emicka-93846","26 November 2023","The latest installment in the Hunger Games saga is a visual feast that captivates from start to finish. The aesthetics of the movie are nothing short of breathtaking, with meticulous attention to detail evident in both the costumes and architecture. The effects used throughout the film contribute to its overall immersive experience, bringing to life the dystopian world of Panem in a way that feels both futuristic and hauntingly plausible.One of the standout aspects of the movie is the introduction of Olivia and Rodrigo's song, adding a contemporary touch to the film's soundtrack. The incorporation of modern elements seamlessly blends with the dystopian setting, creating a unique and memorable atmosphere.The acting in the movie is stellar, with each cast member delivering a compelling performance. The casting choices are spot-on, bringing characters to life with authenticity and depth. The story itself serves as a captivating exploration of the origins of the Hunger Games and why the people of Panem tune in to watch these brutal competitions. It sheds light on the motivations and decisions that set the stage for the future tribulations faced by the districts.However, the narrative takes an unexpected turn with Lucy Gray's victory and the subsequent government response. While the film excels in portraying the evolution of President Snow, the transformation of another key character, Coryo, felt sudden and somewhat perplexing. The ambiguity surrounding his shift to evil leaves viewers questioning the overall message of the movie.The ending, unfortunately, left some viewers scratching their heads. The abruptness of Coryo's descent into darkness felt somewhat random, especially considering the film's focus on the gradual corruption of President Snow. The climax raises questions about the broader message, as it seems to suggest that achieving goals involves sacrificing morality and resorting to extreme measures.Despite these reservations, the movie provides an engaging and entertaining experience. The captivating storyline, impressive visuals, and strong performances make it a worthy addition to the Hunger Games universe. The decision to cast an attractive actor as the villain adds an interesting layer, making it challenging for viewers to completely despise the character. Nevertheless, the abrupt narrative shift in the concluding moments may leave some fans feeling a bit unsatisfied, longing for a more coherent resolution to the story of Panem's descent into darkness.","

The writing was odd in some places but it's so few that it doesn't affect much. The cast was good. Peter Dinklage did good as always. The was actually one of the better prequels to an already established franchise. I did not have high hopes for this because I didn't want to come away from the movie disappointed.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","michaelgerharz","18 November 2023","Rachel Zegler is a great singer but the whole singing parts just felt weird and forced. I was waiting for the movie to turn into a musical. Throughout the movie Lucy Gray has a guardian angel around her, giving her Spider-Man reflexes so she doesn't even have to fight. I call it Avoidant Mary Sue. Of course she doesn't have any flaws, just a kind person who does everything from the good of her heart. Someone you would never trust if you met her in real life, unless you're naive and inexperienced. In short, very badly written. The characters romance comes out of nowhere and moves so fast it felt like a comedic relief. The relationships between characters also abruptly change without any explanation whatsoever, turning them against each other. This is shown in Snow's character, the main villain in the series, who suddenly changes into a murdering psychopath.","

It felt like the book all over again. They let out some minor details, but it feels right and complete and easy to understand for everyone who hasn't read the book yet. Rachel Zegler and her incredible voice made her look and sound like Lucy Gray from the book, which is really hard, and she sang it all live on set. Can't recommend the movie and the book enough, go see it in the cinemas.","

The characters, especially the female protagonist, lacked depth. The musical-like vibe, despite not being a musical, felt out of place, with an excess of songs. I read one review about excessive songs, and halfway through the movie, there were three, and I thought that the reviewer was exaggerating. But I kid you not, she sang at least 13 other songs in the other half. In the final scenes, the acting of the male protagonist was quite interesting, but I didn't understand the sudden change; there was no buildup.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","johantheill","15 November 2023","The film is visually very good and beautifully made. The film in itself is not bad but it is far too tightly screwed together it could use more immersion in the development of various characters. Even though the action is packed, it is still long drawn out and you can't help but look at your phone to see what time it is when you are sitting in the cinema. Tom Blyth plays the role of Snow fantastic, but I can't say this about Rachel Zegler, she makes the film seem like a musical, she generally just doesn't fit into the film as Lucy Gray, she lacks this ""bad ass"" thing that Katniss/Lawrence had. Overall, the film is nice to watch if you need something to ser when you're bored, but I can't recommend watching it in the cinema, it's not worth it.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","judealexharnett","17 November 2023","Having read the book less than two months ago it was more or less fresh in my mind. And to be fair it was a pretty faithful adaptation. There was some stiff left out but what was left out I didn't care too much for. There were a lot of positives. Great preformances on all front, especially from viola Davis who was the show stealer in my opinion. Corlionas and Lucy grays dynamic was just as good In the book and sejanus is portrayed just as much of an annoying twat as in the books. The soundtrack was really good too and Rachel zegler has an amazing voice. Jason schwartzman is great as lucky flickerman but he's no ceaser flickerman. My biggest issue is the pacing. It could have been a lot better. I wouldn't have been annoyed if it was split into two parts. The first two parts had pretty minimal issues but the last part felt really rushed. Still, snow lands on top is honestly one of the best ending lines ever. 8.7/10.","

It's an origin story of one of the characters, and it wasn't even that entertaining. It had so much potential, but was executed poorly. Not worth watching unless you particularly care for HG series. There's no action or thrill. It has it moments, but they're brief and rushed. Its all drama and character development. Typically I'm one to say a movie is better than most people say it is (I even liked the live action avatar Airbender movies after growing up on the cartoon!!)

Suprisingly, my boyfriend, who was so annoyed that he must go with me to the cinema for this one, ended up liking the movie ( rated it 8.5 ). I think the start od the movie was the worst part and the best one was part III. I also didnt like Rachel singing, but besides that she was a good performer as Lucy. Also kinda hoped for more Tigris. I think the movie is important (the same with the book), because there are some things we dont think that much about in day to day life.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","spencermcook","1 December 2023","Does this film fit cohesively within the Hunger Games franchise? Absolutely. The tone of this film is nearly identical to the rest; with its half-baked sets embodied by CGI, warm tones to portray the deceiving virtues of the Capital contrasted by cold tones to showcase the depleted nature of the districts, and the solo buildup of a character who expresses heroic mentalities. The problem that director Francis Lawrence runs into is trying to mimic Coriolanus Snow's journey with the story of Katniss Everdeen. The first 65% of the film is truly entertaining, however the predetermined outcome of this character is exposed by a choppy transition in the story arc in order to blend this film organically within the franchise. Tom Blyth gives a credible performance that is heightened by the fact that he's shown in 95% of the film, whereas Rachel Zegler pioneers the innovative approach of making this adaptation a musical. Similar to large IP franchises such as Marvel, DC, or Star Wars, there's an equal amount of moments to criticize as there are to enjoy, and I'm perfectly fine with that.","

The male lead is actually solid and hope he can save the series but she's got to go.So derivative of its origins I can't begin to explain. Basically the same cast of characters bastardized to be lesser versions of the original. I'm not saying the hunger games is Citizen Cane but it had its charms.

Fury of the Gods, West Side Story_2021; Viola Davis-The Woman King, Law Abiding Citizen and Peter Dinklage-Cyrano, Game of Thrones_tv.This is the origin story of Coriolanus Snow-Donald Sutherland's character in the original movies-so it is a prequel that covers how he came into power. Tom plays Coriolanus, a student rising in the ranks in the Capital. Viola is the President of Panem, with Peter as her next in command. The 10th annual Hunger Games are starting a new season and Tom has Rachel as his volunteer-the Capital calls them tributes. Tom is her mentor in the games but begins to have feelings for Rachel and wants her to actually win, which is not what Viola wants, so they tend to butt heads over protocol. FYI: In case you are wondering about the sub title in the name, Rachel likes to sing-hence the nickname Songbird-and Viola has a 20 foot tank of snakes that she has been experimenting with and uses them on occasions, when necessary. It's a little slow in parts but overall, it's a good origin story.It's rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing material and has a running time of 2 hours & 37 minutes.I would probably buy it on DVD.","

Thus, Snow betrays his friend out of nowhere. And Lucy Gray suddenly flees from Snow without it becoming clear why exactly. Lucy also acts VERY poorly. She is only concerned with being beautiful and charming in the film, you hardly see any emotion, pain or fear. She is just pretty, that's it. You don't believe her, she is not authentic. She seems to be competing in the Voice instead of the Hunger Games. Singing like she is a singer on stage. Instead of being afraid or emotional. Too bad, because her role is important. Jennifer Lawrence was so much better and more believable!!! Snow acted well, and Viola Davis was also excellent as an actress. But it wasn't clear to me why Snow ended up being evil. This is not well developed in the film. All by all, it was a bad movie, and the other parts were so much better. I really can't believe all the positive reviews.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","StrangeSleep","18 November 2023","Unlike so many movies of late, I found this Hunger Games prequel to be engaging, immersive, yet quite disturbing. I had not read the book deliberately, because I wanted to experience the film in its own right, rather than how faithfully it reproduced a written work. Regardless, it effectively chronicles the pivotal events in the nascent corruption of Coriolanus Snow.The horror of the actual Games is far more primitive, gritty and raw than before... much more like Thunderdome from the Mad Max franchise: ""Get to the weapons. Use them any way you can. I know you won't break the rules. There aren't any."" The sickness of this society is encapsulated by the fact that one of the Tributes is a young girl who appears to have Down's Syndrome. Try to wrap your head around that idea...I found the characters to be sufficiently developed for the purposes of the film's narrative. Folk music is interwoven into the movie, perfectly to effect: one of the main protagonists is a folk singer who expresses her emotions and defiance through song.The ""look and feel"" of this era of Panem is brilliant: a bizarrely familiar reimagining of mid-century modern motifs grotesquely blended with elements of the totalitarian architecture of the Third Reich. For those who know the actual photographic record of the latter, you will see numerous things in this film which echo that visual vocabulary, and not simply the sets.I'd recommend seeing this film: given the times we live in, it certainly is a thought-provoking journey.","

Some characters are gone from the book but you don't think about it at all and nothing is missing.In the beginning I admit it's a little quick with everything that's happening but I think that's a choice and I agree with it for most part. A really great detail is also that it is divided in parts and that's really cool according to me.All actors are amazingly cast and they do a really good job. The one person that totally steals the show is of course Viola Davis, terrifying and amazing in every scene.Tom is stunning as a leading man and he really embodies Snow in all that he is.I want to recommend this movie to everybody and I can't explain my love for it.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","zkonedog","29 November 2023","""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is by no means a bad movie. It is entertaining, engaging, and has flashes of brilliance. The Hunger Games prequel also is an adaptation of a young adult novel--and such theme focuses may make or break your enjoyment of it.For a very basic overview, ""Songbirds & Snakes"" focuses on Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth), the individual who will ultimately become the Donald Sutherland-played villain of the originals. Mentoring District 12's Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler) in a very early Hunger Games iteration, Snow falls for her (or is that the other way around?) and the two form an unlikely pairing that will ultimately lead both of them in very different directions.As I mentioned, there were parts of this film that I truly did enjoy. In some ways, it is a star vehicle for Zegler, whose singing talents are truly special. Seeing such an early iteration of the Hunger Games competition is of course interesting, and there are a number of ""easter eggs"" for fans of the original films to smile at.However, I will argue that ""Songbirds & Snakes"" fails at its primary mission: to show the trajectory of Coriolanus Snow from well-meaning Panem student to the sneering Sutherland villain. The strange thing is, the film doesn't outrightly fail at this task--all (or at least most of) the steps are indeed present. But they are handled with a very YA sensibility befitting the novels they are based on. In other words, the themes and arcs of this movie are best invested by a tween, teen, or younger audience, I think. Some of the material is very much ""on the nose"", while at other times it comes off as a bit lacking in true follow-through of the Snow character mission other than ""well, we know he's going to become the big baddie, so..."".Granted, the original Hunger Games set largely has those YA approaches baked into it too, but the inclusion of Jennifer Lawrence's super-serious Katniss was a tonic (at least for me). As good as Zegler is as an entertainer, she is not in the Lawrence acting category (at least not yet).Perhaps others will not have as much of a ""sophistication"" problem with ""Songbirds & Snakes"" as I did. But other than never being bored, the flick failed to draw me into its key tenets of existence because I felt it was constantly shooting for only the approval of a much younger audience than I.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","jakeconant","21 November 2023","I just don't feel like it did anything to meaningfully justify its own existence. It's well-made, that's for certain, and the actors are trying extremely hard to believe in the world the filmmakers have put them in. But it just smells so...Hollywood. DOA. It's like looking at a corpse of a Hunger Games movie. Clearly, it's going to make a zillion dollars, especially internationally (I saw it in a semi-packed theater in Madrid). It's almost like what Disney is doing to Marvel -- inventing pre- and back-stories that actually don't need to exist because they add nothing to the canon, nor do they change the way you see the other movies. No additive comprehension. The Games themselves were much, much too short, and they solved the problem of the games themselves in a deus ex machina way that was deeply unsatisfying. I'm super impressed with Rachel Zegler, because she clearly is a talented musician who learned probably 10 different songs for this movie...but in the end, the whole thing feels like a borderline musical meant to appease an imagined audience consisting mostly of teenagers. In other words? Weirdly gimmicky. I found the whole thing boring, and kind of stale. Give it a pass. You'll be fine.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","sbweightman","18 November 2023","More of a political thriller than an action adventure, the story follows the creator of the new Hunger Games in three distinct parts. Good use of imagery and foreshadowing as it reuses the main themes from the original stories but with a fresh view. The story is good if a bit simplified and obvious at times, but it was enjoyable throughout due to the great acting from the main cast, the cracking country ballads and the use of contrast from the grand to the dilapidated in the scenery and settings. The Games themselves weren't as shocking or thrilling as they could have been, but were still entertaining to watch and the run-down nature of the arena fitted well within the post-war recovery setting.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","grant-jenkins","19 November 2023","This film has an interesting look and design. It relly feels like the past of this world where they haven't yet perfected the devious Hunger Games. But sooo much on-the-nose dialogue where characters only talk about the things they've done, in part, makes this a terrible script. And what is the story here, star-crossed lovers or rags-to-riches rise of a fascist dictator? The director doesn't know, so why should we care? Finally, if the plot is the latter, then it's really hard to care about the rise of a evil character. And Lucy Grey isn't that much better because she makes many questionable choices and not the ones she thinks are bad. Skip this film and rewatch the OG, which is almost a flawless script and film.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","georgewhittingham1","17 November 2023","I'll start off by saying I've never read the books, and nor should I have to! It's a film after all.The first 1/3 of the movie starts off really well. We're instantly transported into the world, we learn about and connect with our main character, and the plot is set up, ready to go, potentially greatness awaits.Unfortunately, when the actual games starts, the writing just goes downhill, where in the cinema I actually shook my head with disappointment several times. The overall quality does actually pick up around 2/3, but out ending then crashing down to an overall 6/10.The writing, like a lot of tv and cinema these days, just let's it down. Moments that could be poignant become laughable, and I also feel (despite its long run time) certain parts, particularly connecting with anyone but our protagonist, we're very rushed.Lastly, Rachel Ziegler just isn't a very good actor. Almost all of her lines are delivered in exactly the same way, which is a shame as our lead I actually thought did a really good job. Worth seeing, but not watching again.","

It felt so rushed. I can't stand Rachel Ziegler as lucy gray. She's just so harsh and stiff with the mannerisms and it feels very forced in the acting. I really didn't enjoy the singing in the movie either. I wish they touched more on Coriolanus and Sejanus' relationship. I didn't like the casting and felt the cast didnt fit the roles in the book. I wish it was more true to the book. The characters just felt empty and like nothing was behind them. I did however really like Tom bylth as Coriolanus he was the perfect snow.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","godasejal","29 November 2023","I'd love to provide you with a detailed review of ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes.""Suzanne Collins' return to the Hunger Games universe with ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" was highly anticipated, promising a prequel that would delve into the origins of the tyrannical President Snow and the early days of the Hunger Games. Set decades before Katniss Everdeen's time, this novel takes us back to the core of Panem's history, offering a deeper understanding of the world we came to know in the original trilogy.The story introduces us to a young Coriolanus Snow, whose life and aspirations are dramatically altered when he is assigned to mentor the tribute from District 12, Lucy Gray Baird, in the 10th Hunger Games. Snow's character development is central to this narrative, as we witness his moral compass and ambitions shape under the weight of societal expectations and personal choices.Collins skillfully paints a bleak and captivating picture of the Capitol, detailing its opulence and disparity from the districts. The grim reality of life outside the Capitol is portrayed vividly, showcasing the struggle for survival and the bleak circumstances faced by the oppressed districts. The author succeeds in creating a palpable sense of tension and unease, establishing the foundation for the totalitarian regime familiar to readers of the original series.The introduction of Lucy Gray Baird, a charismatic and enigmatic tribute, adds depth and intrigue to the storyline. Her mysterious nature and captivating performances on stage during the Games provide a compelling contrast to Snow's calculated demeanor. The dynamic between Snow and Lucy Gray drives much of the novel, presenting a complex interplay of manipulation, loyalty, and survival instincts.One of the strengths of this prequel is its exploration of the moral gray areas within the characters. It presents a thought-provoking examination of the circumstances that can shape a person's choices and values, blurring the lines between right and wrong. Through Snow's internal conflicts and rationalizations, Collins challenges readers to consider the nature of power, privilege, and the consequences of one's actions.However, despite its intriguing premise and character study, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" has been met with mixed reactions. Some readers found it challenging to empathize with a young President Snow, while others appreciated the nuanced portrayal of a character who eventually becomes the series' primary antagonist. The pacing of the novel has also been a point of contention, with moments that feel drawn out juxtaposed with bursts of intense action.Additionally, while the book offers insights into the creation of the Hunger Games and the Capitol's early days, it might not satisfy those expecting the same adrenaline-fueled narrative as the original trilogy. The absence of the rebellion's fervor and the societal critique present in the previous books could leave some Hunger Games enthusiasts wanting more.In conclusion, ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a daring exploration of the Hunger Games universe, providing a deeper understanding of President Snow's character and the origins of the Games. Collins' narrative choices and her ability to humanize a character traditionally viewed as a villain contribute to a thought-provoking read. However, its departure from the familiar tone of the original series and its divisive portrayal of a young Snow might not resonate with all fans. It's a book that provokes discussion and offers a new perspective on the complexities of human nature and power.","

I am admittedly a large fan of the first four movies, which is why I was equally as excited and scared to see this film. It did not disappoint. Excellent plot throughout, and it did an amazing job translating the book into a movie. If there was anything negative to say it would be I wanted a little more backstory, but I still thought every character was great and well acted. From start to finish it doesn't have any weak moments, and each scene feels like it has a purpose.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","mishahaynie","10 January 2024","I'm not a Hunger Games fan, but this installment fell short for me, earning only two stars. As a newcomer to The Hunger Games movies, I found this prequel to be unnecessarily violent. Despite being rated PG-13, it showcased more violence, bloodshed, and killing compared to several R-rated movies I've seen, raising concerns about its appropriateness.The movie was not only gruesome and brutal but also left an uncomfortable impression. The atmosphere depicted a world where everyone turns on each other, devoid of characters to genuinely root for. This lack of relatable protagonists made the entire experience cringe-worthy and depressing.While I acknowledge that the themes align with the book series, the level of discomfort surpassed my expectations. Exiting the theater, my friends and I shared a collective feeling of unease. If the subsequent movies continue to portray such intense violence and the bleak depiction of humanity turning on itself, I may choose to skip them altogether.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","CANpatbuck3664","25 November 2023","I didn't give myself over to Songbirds & Snakes immediately. The movie certainly had my attention and I think the opening was very strong in establishing Coriolanus as a complicated protagonist and setting him down his path to both his triumph and later his destruction. It took me a while to warm up to Lucy Gray, she was too feisty and too finely geared to make her likeable. But her willingness to trust Snow instead of just being whiny and mistrustful and her not too squeaky clean sense of morality wore me down. Her character picks up steam after the games are done and by the end, I was rooting for her. My biggest problem with the original series was how selfish and petulant Katniss could be and Songbirds & Snakes flips the formula by asking us to root for the villain. One of my friends suggested a House of Cards style show just showing Snow's rise to power and S&S showed the potential and promise that kind of project.I hadn't seen either Tom Blyth previously but to follow Donald Sutherland in this role couldn't have been easy. I was quite impressed with his commanding presence and how well he captured Snow's charm and conversely his ruthlessness. He definitely brought some humanity to the character and he conveys slow descent well. Rachel has a ton of energy as Lucy Gray and she's good at being vulnerable in the beginning and being coy & mysterious near the end. Viola Davis, Peter Dinklage and Jason Schwartzman are the heavy hitters in the supporting cast and I enjoyed them all. Viola comes on strong at the start (could the obviously evil character turn out to be evil?) but her performance fits and Dr. Gaul transforms into a formidable enemy by the end.I also want to congratulate this movie for putting more of a focus on the animosity between the Capitol and the Districts. There's a lot more anger and venom between the two sides and the bitterness adds to the stakes. They also do a good job of showing how disorganized the games could be in their beginning cycles. This version of the Hunger Games is much less glamorous, the tributes are barely suitable, the mentors are only in it for themselves and the citizens of the Capitol barely care. It adds to the bleakness of the festivities and how they would eventual fuel another rebellion which is important in where the story will eventually finish with the Katniss saga.I did have some problems with this movie, but they were mostly minor. Songbirds & Snakes relies on some plot contrivances and the film can't help but being a little precious when it's winking at elements from the original trilogy. This is something that isn't unique to Songbirds & Snakes but wouldn't it be nice if it could have been avoided? But the easiest and most obvious problem is that S&S feels a little overproduced. It's been pruned and tweaked for maximum power several times over and it robs it of some of it's spontaneity. I still really enjoyed it but I couldn't help but feel like I was being manipulated a little bit.I really didn't expect much going into this movie. I saw the original trilogy and read the books but I considered The Hunger Games finished and I moved on. I was blown away by how intricately packed and well made this prequel was. Judging by the other user reviews, I might in the minority but Songbirds & Snakes builds on the mythology while staying true to the spirit, the film shapes Coriolanus Snow into a layered and engaging character/villain and reignites the fire for this universe. I'm somewhere between an 8.5-9/10 but I'd wholly recommend this and unless you're extremely attached to the original trilogy, I'd be surprised if you walk away from the theatre without something to discuss or a new appreciation for this franchise. To Suzanne Collins, Francis Lawrence and the creative team, Bravo!","

And his attribute Lucy Gray which she was picked for the tenth Hunger Games.The film follows Snow as he sees society in the dystopian world struggling to live. While Lucy Grays perspective she is fighting for survival. The plot is good. The first hour or so has Lucy going through the Hunger Games and surviving. While last hour follows Snow going through the districts as a soldier looking for Lucy. And dealing with a rebellion.It has a great cast ensemble. Rachel Zegler performance stole the show. The script and direction does feel overlong which has a lot of boring and slow moments. The action sequences is decent and forgettable. May not be the best film in the series. It is not the worst.","

Not that I was a good past in any way shape or form.This movie on it's own though, if we don't look at the other Hunger Games movies, does not do good. The only reason why it is an okay movie is because of it's prequels and sequels. This movie as an independent movie was not good.Casting was poorly done and so was the acting.

All four films every single cast member was brilliant in there own right.Fast forward to this prequel and to put it bluntly it's a shambles, The cast is just terrible.No cohesion between anyone in any scene, they seem to build a character and then you dont see them for an hour if not ever again in the film.Flashback to the first films and Jennifer Lawrence can't really sing but is subtle in her singing that it seems natural she knows she can't sing so tones it down to something bearable. Now Rachel Zegler on the other hand thinks she can sing and it's just terrible every scene in which she sings a song is unbearable, plus she isn't a great actress at all, I just see it as they have rode the curtails of a major movie which was made what it is by great actors and actresses to promote up and coming actors and actresses.Snows character in this film didn't make any sense, having seen him magnificently portrayed by Donald Sutherland to seeing how he is portrayed in this film is just mind boggling, maybe its because Donald is a brilliant actor who knows.The film is supposed to be about the games and for me wasn't enough scenes actually about the games.Overall I would say if this was the very first Hunger Games film in the franchise then they wouldn't of managed to make another 3 movies or a prequel movie after it.","

He became en empty villain character- no complexity, no human element whatsoever.The Hunger Games has an important place in literature and film because it speaks a message to young people about fairness, power and kindness to others but this message was on completely lost in a stupidly rapid, thin narrative.A bit embarrassing tbh.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","rechtienejalec","28 November 2023","I was pleased by this movie. This movie was probably the darkest Hunger Games yet, likely due to its more archaic technology used relative to the previous films. The acting was goods. Say what you want about Zelger, but her acting in this film was definitely a highlight. This film also gives us a better look at the function and reasoning behind this autocratic government, which is build under the principle that ""humans are inherently violent, and we need to be reminded of who we are."" This movie is not flawless though. There are 2 major flaws with this movie: 1) An overly confusing plot, and 2) Subpar story arcs. The plot was a lot like Oppenheimer, where it is a 3 act structure, yet the most action happens in the second act, and the third act is the aftermath. With Oppenheimer though, it at least remained grounded through the entire movie with its philosophical and ethical questions. In this Hunger Games movie, the third act seems to diverge into something really weird with not much direction, and it really only makes sense when it is over. Now to Snow's story arc; it is completely lopsided. This movie is supposed to be a villain origin story, yet we see him as a protagonist all the way until the very end, with not much really much leading up to it, other than maybe a few warning signs. Lucy Grey's story arc is dull too. Why does she just all the sudden leave and try to kill Snow? Her purpose really was as a prop to Snow's already flawed story arc. There doesn't seem to be that character that you can really follow. Overall though, it is a good movie that is definitely worth a watch. The story is gripping, the villain is absolutely crazy (the scientist), and the dystopian themes are very convincing where you almost find yourself rationalizing the tyrannical government.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","GusherPop","18 November 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a prequel to the movie that launched the franchise, focusing on the origins of Panem's authoritarian leader Coriolanus Snow. The film is split into three chapters, delivering a trifecta of overwrought, overacted, and overlong. The adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel explores the Hunger Games' origins and Snow's descent into the dark side. However, the new Snow, played by British actor Tom Blyth, is a bland construct, joining other privileged young Capitol residents as mentors to the youths chosen to compete and die as tributes. Snow is tasked with capturing Lucy Gray Baird, a talented actress from District 12. Snow is captivated by her talent and plans to help her survive the competition. However, he must navigate the eagle-eyed masterminds, Casca Highbottom (Peter Dinklage) and Volumnia Gaul (Viola Davis), who resembles Cruella de Vil in her appearance and line delivery. Lucy's success will be crucial in the film's success. ""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a thrilling prequel based on Suzanne Collins' 2020 novel, focusing on Coriolanus Snow's rise to power. The film showcases Tom Blyth's transformation from a moneyed pretty boy to a clear-eyed manipulator, showcasing Snow's transformation from a destined greatness to a manipulator intent on crafting his fate. The film's gripping performances, including Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Snow, make it a captivating watch. Dr. Volumnia Gaul emphasizes the importance of creating memorable spectacles, with Viola Davis playing a chic, sadistic character with the right amount of camp, and costume designer Trish Summerville's striking creations benefiting her. Snow's dark side is revealed in ""The Peacekeeper,"" a bold departure from previous chapters. The film moves from the austere Capitol to a pastoral forest setting, creating a romantic and dangerous atmosphere. The 157-minute film slows and quiets down, allowing for tension between two people who trust each other. Lucy Gray's folksy charm is used effectively, and the energy in the film is balanced by the lush, romantic, and dangerous atmosphere. ""The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a suspenseful prequel to Coriolanus's long-standing belief that snow always lands on top.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","lolacauneac","17 November 2023","Why is everyone pronouncing it wrong in the movie?Too much singing. I don't know what's wrong with the girl's jaw. No chemistry between the leads.I liked the boy's performance in some scenes. Towards the end you kind of see him finally ""bloom"", only to hear the real Snow say the phrase ""It is the things we love most, that destroy us"", and have the illusion shattered. He didn't manage to get at the same level as the previous actor. But I don't think it was the actor's fault, he is very good in my opinion. I believe it was the directing that was misguided, following the book a bit too much.The Hunger Games books were very badly written. The movies I adore. Watched them a hundred times.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","riverafalcon","25 November 2023","While the movie is almost 3hrs long, it still feels too rushed. If it was broken up in half it would have been more enjoyable and the character development would have been better instead of what we got. I did enjoy it with my wife, but Hollywood needs to slow it down in order to gain another motion picture hit.Snow's character doesn't feel like he's getting darker as in the book but feels more like a crying child who isn't getting his own way with no major change in his mindset to life with the hunger games. There are some additions in the movie that has nothing to do with the book so anyone claiming its faithful needs to reread it again.Enjoyable for a one-time watch but that's all.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","IndridC0ld","9 January 2024","Films that epitomize the essence of movie-making often begin with a compelling story. ""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is no exception, boasting an outstanding narrative alongside remarkable acting, producing, and cinematography that immerse you in its world. Although the film starts somewhat slowly, this cleverly serves as a plot device to foster empathy with the main characters, allowing us to see reflections of our own choices and dilemmas on the screen. Have you ever sacrificed something you love for a necessity? Have you made decisions that altered the course of your life? This movie explores these questions and more over its engaging two and a half hours. It reminds me of films like ""Titanic,"" which don't just transport you away from your life but place you in another's shoes, prompting you to contemplate your own reactions in similar situations. For those who appreciate the preceding works, this film is a solid choice, paying a subtly ingenious tribute to its predecessors. It is replete with plot twists that cleverly subvert expectations. Special mention must go to the young actress McKenzie Lansing, who portrays a villainous character with a pitchfork. Though her role is brief, it is intensely visceral and memorable. In conclusion, this film truly encapsulates the author's vision for an engaging sequel.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Venture825","21 November 2023","I had heard many mixed reviews about this film, but since I am a fan of the series, and reading the book when it came out, I decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed.The film is very faithful to the book, although the first part felt a bit off the side to me, I thought the film as a whole flowed well. The acting felt rather irritating at first, but I got used to it within the first part. Another con I found was that I also thought it would've worked better if it was a TV Series. There would've been more of an opportunity to actually go into depth about each character, because it didn't feel like we actually bonded with any of the characters, apart from Sejanus but even then in the end he turned about to be a bit of a jerk.Although I found it enjoyable, definitely too violent for a 12A, but the screenplay was entertaining, the cinematography was good. Worth a watch if you're a longtime fan.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","KFstudios2009","18 November 2023","The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is the prequel to The Hunger Games, were they show us the first original beginnings of the games. Everything was less technological and looked more like a Gladiator arena, and here I could really feel that they were fighting to survive, the connection between the tributes was really strong, and they made that danger feeling much stronger in here, then in the original movies. It was also about the story of President Snow, how he started as a young man that had plans for a bright future, but ended with an evil path, with rage and madness. His story, and how his rage was evolving, was showed greatly, with complete understanding. The movie itself, did have dominating pros, but could have fixed some things. The pros, first of all, was amazing storytelling. They distributed the story in three parts, each chapter about a specific topic. I liked the prequel best from the franchise because it was richer story. In the originals, they focused mostly on one topic, but here, they included more of everything. Story, feelings and character development. President Snow as a character was amazingly performed by Tom Blyth, as a lost boy of perfection and squareness. Rachel Zegler as the songbird, Lucy Gray Bird, was the movies mystery. She was like an incomplete book, and made her more an interesting character. Rachel Zegler took her role, and personally, she is a very good singer, she is very pretty, but her acting is decent. Her acting could be better, her expressions could look more realistic. Her songs were good, though, they were mostly about the society and people of district twelve, and gave me a bigger understanding of their culture. The first Hunger Games was ok, but it always missed a puzzle. It didn't really explain the nature of the country, society and culture, something they did in this part, and made it finally a complete picture. Good scenography, editing and action sequences. The Hunger Games fights were very entertaining, very barbaric, and some of the kills were pretty well made, with good dramatical scenes and so. They could focus a little bit on the dialogues, more originality, even though it was good enough. The beginning with an impressive intro ended with a good, dramatical outro, and closed the movie complete. To conclude, this is the best Hunger Games so far, and I hope maybe some day the story will continue in a similar way as this one.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","srundkvist","21 November 2023","The movie portrays snow incredibly inaccurately. He has so much more depth than the movie shows. He is very young when the movie/book takes place and it shows when reading but not in the movie. It makes sense since the story has been condensed into one 2 hour and 40 minute long movie, I wish they would have made it two, two hour movies.Coriolanus Snow is a very calculated young kid but not like the movie portrays. In the movie he seemingly goes out of his way to cheat while in the book he does to accidentally or as an afterthought, he doesn't intend to but he does and then tries to justify it.Coriolanus is not a ""cold blooded killer"" despite how the movie portrays him. I've heard people call him that before. I think that when he runs away with Lucy, the reality of what he's doing starts to set in and to justify him wanting to leave and go back, his mind convinces him that she has figured everything out and is trying to kill him.Later when he goes back to the capitol and he starts looking for ways to improve the hunger games, I don't think he actually believes the hunger games to be the best solution. I think he sees the hunger games as the only solution. He knows that the children In the games are innocent and that they are real human beings, but he also believes that without the hunger games the capitol will be poor and he will have to go back to living like he and Lucy were planning to and that's his worst nightmare.Whenever he kills someone (in the book) he is finding a reason as to why it's justified and the reason is always for his personal gain, not because he simply wanted them dead. So in his mind he is most likely justifying the games as the only way for him to not go on to live ""a poor lifestyle"" again. It's okay to keep the hunger games going because it ensures that he doesn't have to ""fraternise"" with lower class people and it ensure that he won't fall in love with someone like Lucy Gray again.Coriolanus is all about power and control. Lucy Gray is his polar opposite. Coriolanus expresses how he felt that he lost control around Lucy Gray because he was in love with her. He then also explains how he never wants to feel that again and that if i is to have children it will be with someone he hates so that they can't control him.Even while Lucy Gray was in the arena he only wanted her to survive because he wanted her to stay in the capitol with him and not because he wanted her to live to see her family again, he wanted her because he loved her, but he didn't love her enough to become a part of her world.This movie is way to condensed to do the story justice, if only it had been two movies.TLDR: Snow is not a cold blooded killer who actively tries to cheat in the hunger games to win. He is a thoughtful kid obsessed with his own personal gain and wealth and he sees the hunger games as the only option to obtain that.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","siderite","14 December 2023","I blame it on Lucy Gray, a character so annoyingly righteous and vigorously rebellious that it was very difficult to connect to anything she touched. Fixing just this character would have made this film close to greatness, because almost everything else was good. The casting, the acting, the sets, the story.Tom Blyth was great, Viola David too. Most other characters were filler, but they were cast well and did their job. As opposed to the original trilogy of films, this felt more grounded, more mature. It wasn't perfect, but I enjoyed the film.There were three parts of the movie, the third felt the most rushed and frankly I would have probably liked the film more if it were not part of it. It would have also brought it to a normal length; I hate these modern three hours productions. If you can't tell your story in 2 hours, that's a problem. The story was intriguing, documenting in a tense and oppressive way the rise of a villain, I think one of the most entertaining types of tales out there, but the rushed third part muddled that a bit.I can't believe I am saying this, but this deserved a split into two films. As such, you are left with a bitter aftertaste, like someone took something that you felt had coming from you. Enough to turn one into a villain.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","masonfisk","7 December 2023","A new entry in the franchise is now a prequel (taking place 10 years after the first Hunger Games) as we follow the rise of President Snow (essayed by Donald Sutherland in the first series) as a young man, Tom Blyth, who has seen the worse of the war alongside his sister, Euphoria's Hunter Schafer, but now live in the bustling metropolis of Panem awaiting news if he's won the coveted Plinth prize which his family desperately needs since their finances are on the wane. To add more stress, the new Hunger Games are upon them & the ratings are down so the game makers, Oscar winner Viola Davis & Peter Dinklage, will introduce to this new tourney having the contestants interact directly w/their mentors w/Blyth partnered w/Rachel Zegler (already tagged as someone to watch since when her name's announced she flings a snake in a rival's blouse & sings in defiance to her nomination). What follows is another battle royal (sorry since the Hunger Games were always pegged as American copies of that notorious Japanese classic) w/most of the gameplay located to one environment as we wait to see if Zegler will pull off a win. Francis Lawrence wisely returns back to the fold after directing 3 previous entries already & his knowledge of the material works well enough to mount something familiar which still manages to rankle some genuine tension & disgust at the extreme politics seen on screen (maybe something The Phantom Menace wanted to do?) w/the performances fine & flinty which makes me wonder if there's enough fire in Suzanne Collins' belly to put out more installments to be filmed.","

I loved the feel that this Layout gave the overall film.First Act - Introduction to Various Notable Characters and Other Minor Characters, introduction to this World they have Created on Screen, and the Introduction to the Plot that is to Unfold.Second Act - The Actual Games themselves and the dynamics going on within/outside of the games.Third Act - I really Loved this, it just had a ""oh, we're still going"" vibe and had nice relaxing moments as well as more intense moments. Also, you could subtly see the change of Coriolanus Going more and more into Ruthlessness.2a. 👌 Then we have 5 Top Notch Performances by Tom Blyth, Rachel Zegler, Viola Davis, Peter Dinklage and Josh Andres Rivera as Sejanus Plith.2b. 🤐 Look I am by no means a Rachel Zegler Stan at all, her Sheer Ability in her Acting and Accent were Very Good and at times, her Singing Ability is Quite Something.3. The Screenplay was Great, again with the Excellent acting and Dialogue, and pretty much this is the Beginning of Coriolanus Snow and certain things he went through and did.4. 🎥 The Cinematography was Something to Behold, there were so many Eye Popping Shots. I had to Adjust my eyes multiple Times to take in what I was witnessing. 👀 👌5. (One of my Favourite Scenes) Near the End when Coriolanus picks the Gun up and says ""No more loose Ends"" Lucy Gray - ""Besides me"" Coriolanus - ""You wouldn't Tell anyone?"" Lucy Gray - ""Course Not"". And then the Look 😶. I Loved that Scene.6. 🗽 The Very Ending with Coriolanus Snow finally coming into his own and will become the Future Gamemaker.7. 🔊 (Bonus) The Sound Design was very good, particularly, the Birds when people are hung. The sound of the Ceiling Speakers and Side Speakers were travelling all around the Auditorium.Overall, Excellent Story, Performances and Stunning Production.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","r96sk","12 January 2024","I was thoroughly enjoying this... until it absolutely nosedives during the latter half.'The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes' starts off so strongly, continuing at a pleasant pace as it encompasses the Hunger Games itself. However, from the end of the event it truly does drop off a cliff out of nowhere. The film gives you a major high of action with the games, then drops the tempo down to such a slow first act-esque pace that it feels extremely tacked on.I did enjoy the cast throughout, mostly. Tom Blyth is excellent, first time I've seen him properly in a film and I was very impressed; though even his performance suffers with the aforementioned, which for him is from the point that he becomes The Real Slim Shady, seemingly (his originally look is so much better). Still, I'm eager to see that guy act further.Rachel Zegler is largely good, though does chew the scenery quite a bit in parts; predominantly when singing. Viola Davis is great, while Peter Dinklage is underused but still a positive. Jason Schwartzman and Josh Andrés Rivera, meanwhile, are solid enough supports.Just a shame about the final act. It's not necessarily that bad in itself, but to lower the pace that sharply after such prolonged thrill is a recipe for disaster. So much so that it makes the whole part drag hard, or perhaps 'twas just so for me?","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Chalice_Of_Evil","16 November 2023","I never read the books the original films, or this one, were adapted from. Consequently, I was somewhat lost at times and it almost felt as though this prequel needed its *own* prequel since characters acted like/referred to things as if we should know WHY they acted that way/what they were talking about. This is where book-readers will have an advantage over non-book-readers, as they'll *know* why certain characters are acting the way they do with others, etc. Of course, the downside to being a book-reader is that you'll no doubt be overly critical about every little detail, things you imagined differently, changes made, and things left out or added in. The benefit I had was judging this movie solely based on its own merits, coming into it fresh and with little idea of what would be happening (other than seeing the origin of how Snow turned evil).The movie's broken up into three parts titled 'The Mentor', 'The Prize' and 'The Peacekeeper'. Tom Blyth as a pre-Donald Sutherland version of Coriolanus Snow proves himself a capable leading man, as his character goes through quite the journey in the film and he rises to every occasion, playing all the different facets of Snow's personality in his early life. He starts out as someone whose main motivation is a monetary prize, but then this 'rebel' (who's referred to as such on more than one occasion) becomes invested for more personal reasons in the survival of the tribute he's selected to play mentor to: Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). I feel some have been unfairly critical of Zegler's performance, letting the things she's said in interviews (that've rattled some feathers...but have absolutely *nothing* to do with how she plays her character here) colour their judgement. I personally thought she held her own against Blyth's Snow admirably. As Lucy Gray describes herself, she's 'not made of sugar', and this becomes abundantly clear during her introduction when she drops a snake down the back of a girl's dress. Then later, during Lucy Gray's first meeting with Coriolanus, she eats a petal off the white rose he presents her with (which definitely leaves an impression).People have complained about 'too much singing' in the movie (but it's RIGHT THERE in the title: 'The BALLAD of SONGbirds & Snakes'), but don't be scared of the singing...the movie's not a 'musical' like some have made it out to be. While Zegler certainly puts the 'song' in 'songbird' by providing the majority of the film's soundtrack, it's part of her character (and actually an important plot point). Plus, she can really hold a tune...so why the complaining? It'd be one thing if she sang BADLY, but she gives the songs her all, putting emotion/feeling into every one (and it's not over-polished, which is appreciated). The film rests mainly on these two actors' shoulders, and I personally found their scenes together to be the most compelling parts of the movie. Lucy Gray starts out not trusting Coriolanus, but he shows her on more than one occasion that he isn't without heart and gradually she grows to trust him, as they work together to ensure her survival in the Hunger Games.Another stand-out in the cast is Jason Schwartzman as Lucretius ""Lucky"" Flickerman, weatherman and aspiring magician (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Stanley Tucci's Caesar Flickerman from the original films), as his reporting the weather while kids are dying in the arena provides some morbid humour at one point (really, he's the only source of 'humour' in the film). Head Gamemaker, Dr. Volumnia Gaul is a frightful sight (her makeup's seriously unnerving) and you can't help but wonder if the reason everyone's so hungry is because Viola Davis keeps devouring all the scenery. Her rainbow of snake muttations are a colourful way to take out the stragglers when there is only a handful left. Speaking of, I remember the acting for the tributes who weren't Katniss (whose name I was surprised to learn the origin of in this film) or Peeta in the original films was pretty sketchy...and it hasn't really improved this time around. Other than one or two who make the most of their limited screentime (that we either feel sorry for, as they're practically Dead Meat Walking, or are shown to be more three-dimensional than they first appeared), the majority feel barely above CW teen drama levels in the acting department.Much better are other supporting characters such as Dean Casca Highbottom (Peter Dinklage, continuing to play characters who drink and know things...that is until the end when he *doesn't* know something, which proves fatal), Sejanus Plinth (Josh Andrés Rivera, playing a friend of Coriolanus and a fellow mentor who won't stand for the Games' barbarity...which also proves fatal) and Tigris (Hunter Schafer, playing cousin to Coriolanus...or 'Coryo' as she calls him, who I found particularly interesting to watch and really enjoyed her scenes with Blyth's Snow). Something this movie has definitely stepped up from the previous films is the brutality of the Games, as there's no shortage of death (so don't get too attached to anyone). I also found the themes explored in the movie felt more 'mature' and there was a complexity that you might miss the intricacies of if you're not paying attention.Although it may seem like the film loses some steam in its third part, it's necessary to show that things aren't all fine and dandy after the Games are over with. The relationship between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray is not one that's wrapped up in a nice neat little bow. There's an open-endedness that may frustrate some people, but the important thing is that by the film's end...The President Snow of the future has been born/created. On the whole, I found the movie held my attention throughout (not a small feat considering its runtime) and I liked it better than the first, third and fourth previous films. Only the second film, Catching Fire, would I rank higher than this one.","

The pacing was rather odd. At times it would feel like the film was rushing through scenes and then at other times, spending way too much time on scenes that don't really further the narrative or show off the characters in any meaningful way.The performances were good but the side characters performances stood out so much more than our primary protagonist.The production and costume design was great, as was the soundtrack.","

Peter Dinklage is proper good as always but does so much more with his screen time, very melancholy.The games are what you expect, killing, sadness, and human waste and suffering, it's timely with the war in Gaza right now, the overall tone of a society of very much of haves and have nots, is age old but it's carried well.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","apereztenessa-1","19 November 2023","In 2008, Suzanne Collins took the young adult world by storm with the publication of The Hunger Games, soon turned into a global phenomenon movie franchise with the first entry coming out as early as 2012. With hindsight, it's the political vision infused in The Hunger Games that is most striking. Panem reflects a vision of the United States where a small group of economic, intellectual and artistic elites live extravagantly in rich cities, devoid of true human values, while the rest of the country lives in poverty, working hard and sustaining traditional values and human authenticity. Whether you share this vision or not, it is hard to disagree that it reflected well-ahead of its time a political view that millions of Americans (and others in the world) would embrace a few years later.Now, eight years after the last installment in the series, a prequel is released that tells the origin story of the franchise villain, Coriolanus Snow. Let it be said that the film succeeds in building an engaging story about the development of this character, one that is full of action, excitement and well-crafted character development. However, more than Snow's origin story, it's the origin story of Panem and the Capitol that catches our attention, given the strength of the political message in the first four films. In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, we are presented with a Capitol that looks very different from the one seen in the previous films. Instead of the extravagant town reflective of liberal cities in the US, we see a grey city, built in massive concrete structures, that is highly reminiscent of the image we have of Soviet or Eastern European communist cities in the 70's and 80's. The structures, the clothes, the sculptures towering over giant squares, the cars, the propaganda posters are all reflective of communist imagery. That is ultimately the subversive political message infused into this prequel: the behavior and decadence of the Capitol (and by extension of liberal American cities) has its roots in communism. For anyone who understood the political message in the first four films and its connection with some political views in America, this conclusion is not unexpected, but it is certainly a bit disturbing to see it so prominently displayed in such a mass-market oriented movie targeting the young.In the spirit of open-mindedness and democratic values, one can still choose to appreciate and enjoy the film without agreeing with its political message (something many are unable to do these days). There is for example no doubt that the Soviet imagery creates an amazing visual experience, in particular with the representation of a hunger games arena that is visually impactful and very different from the one in previous installments.Ultimately, The Hunger Games is an exciting franchise and this new installment is no exception. And whether you agree with its political vision or not, history has told us that it has had a way of being ahead of its time, and therefore that it is worth listening to.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","cdjh-81125","17 November 2023","I've always had a soft spot for the Hunger Games franchise since it was the first time I made an effort to read the books before the films came out. I think the first two films are genuinely fantastic which still holds up really well despite the overindulgent 3rd and 4th films disappointing me. I've been excited for this film since it was announced cause I just love the world that's been created for this series and I really enjoyed the book of Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. While the film itself isn't free from all the book's shortcoming, I still really enjoyed seeing another movie set in this world.The great world building from the original trilogy continues to be a massive positive here. I loved the retro-futuristic aesthetic and this film manages the capture the inherent terror that comes from this premise. This is something the f original excelled at and none of the sequels quite recaptured. The tension leading up to the start of the games is so well captured, it's terrifying to put yourself in the situation of these characters and it's exceedingly more gritty and graphic than any of the other movies. There were more genuinely disturbing moments than I expected there to be, even having read the book, and it's by far the darkest entry in the franchise.I really liked the tone of this movie. It's a villain origin first and foremost and the script takes its time to develop this twisted romance and how it leads to the downfall of Snow as a person. We're definitely not watching Jennifer Lawrence's character and Tom Blyth does such a good job at giving small hints to the ferocious nature of this character. He's great and so is Rachel Zegler in what I think may be my favourite performance from her. She's a great singer, (we knew that from West Side Story) which this character does a lot of, she's great in all the action scenes and her chemistry with Blyth phenomenally realises the growing wedge between this pair until it comes to ahead very well I think.Like the novel, I do think it's a bit long in the tooth. At over 2 and a half hours there's a lot of material being explored and it can make the first two acts feel quite scatter shot. The first act in particular feels a bit too quick cut, the second act isn't quite a tight as it could've been and the third act takes quite a sudden turn which I was prepared for but did feel a bit jarring. I did think reading the book that an adaption could lend itself better to a miniseries and having seen the film now I don't necessarily think I was wrong in that belief.I also think the characters as a whole are a bit of a mixed bag. I loved the central pair, Peter Dinklage's character and Viola Davis' deliciously over the top villain but most of the others were fairly one note. Josh Andrés Rivera's character was a high point from the book but I don't think he's that well realised here. I found him quite naive and not in an endearing way to the point where I didn't really care much when he was on screen. Most the students characters are just there to be classist caricatures without much depth and the tributes get some nice moments but it's obvious they're not the focus.It's definitely indulgent and scattershot but as a fan of the book and this series as a whole, I really enjoyed The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes as an adaptation. It's considerably darker than most YA adaptions, not to mention more graphic, and I could be more critical of certain aspects but as a fan I just couldn't help but enjoy the experience of this movie. I would comfortably put this as my 3rd favourite Hunger Games movie and if we don't get anymore this is without the best adaption of a YA movie series we've had since the Harry Potter franchise.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","BPRICE99","4 December 2023","This just wasn't it for me, maybe because I haven't really delved into the rest of the films - or I am not as emotionally attached to this series. I think it was a bit of swing and a miss.I thought it looked great, don't get me wrong this film looks and sounds great too - although I think this could be a borderline musical really but that's beside the point. Set design, costume, sound all of this was good and intriguing to the eye and fits perfectly into the series without any raised eyebrows.The story was somewhat ok and I think what knocked it for me was that it was very drawn out (I haven't read the book so it may be very faithful) but I thought that this could of been sped up somewhat. I found this film came into its own too late, and is mainly the reason why I found it long and perhaps a bit tedious.Action sequences where good, characters were certainly hit and miss, Violet Davis' is someone I would happily not see again.I feel this was a good attempt, but just missed the mark for me personally.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","BoydudeReviews","17 November 2023","I have never read the books before and it has been many years since I watched the movies. But I really enjoyed this film. Racheal Zeglar is awesome. I really enjoyed her performance. As well as the dude who played young snow. The movie feels like two movies but for some reason, it didn't feel bloated. It actually flowed really nicely. The third act was cery unexpected and took a very different tone in storytelling. I found it a little shocking if I am being honest. But I liked it alot. The first act 8s exactly what you think the film is going to be and the 2nd and 3rd act are pretty interesring with how different it is. But I enjoyed it. The one problem I had was that I would have liked more expansion into the plot points in thr third act. I could tell the screenwriters cut alot of that middle act out, even though I didn't reas the books. ButnI will give the film 8/10. Very good film. Must watch.😁","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","hieropice-05301","14 January 2024","I tried to watch this film. I was a fan of both the original series books and films. I haven't read the book this latest film was based on, and after watching the film (as much as I could stand), I likely won't bother.What the previous books and films did well (for the most part) was convince you a world where society was so broken that people would watch children slaughter each other on tv was possible. They built a universe with a history, characters, and circumstances that made sense, despite their extreme nature.But this film did none of that. We're introduced to characters, the protagonists, who immediately seem absurd. It was like they were trying to channel Harry Potter in a world that was never about magic, but instead about human evolution under extreme forces.One of the protagonists starts randomly singing while in Renaissance Faire cosplay within the first 20 minutes. People in the audience sing back-up. Why?! It was sentimental, saccharin and just silly. We don't even know these characters yet, but should buy that they're singing sending the protagonist off to die?I tried to continue watching, but none of the actors even seem to be in the same room as each other. Their interactions are unbelievable; Rachel clearly does not understand the tone of these stories and seems like she's been involuntarily transported from a Broadway stage. I didn't make it past the tv introductions of tribute and mentor scene, not even 30 minutes in. I can't stand terrible films, and this one just wasn't worth my time.","

Really hard to follow and get excited about anything. Can I get a refund????I don't know who the REAL target audience was, but if you watched the original series of movies that were good, this one just made no sense. The depiction of a future higher class society is was annoying and ridiculous.The main actors did well and that is the only reason we stay as long as we did, but the story line and everything else was just off the charts bad.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","tylerwfortenberry","20 November 2023","To start off with, if you didn't read the book, you likely won't like the movie, or so I've seen. That being said, I highly recommend picking up the book (yes it is in fact the longest one yet).TBSS was a long overdue return to Panem and was a story that was well received by the screen. Cinematically, the movie had some amazing shots and close ups that superseded its predecessors. This is in no doubt thanks to the almost ten years that have elapsed since the last installment in the franchise.As for chemistry, the tension between Blyth and Ziegler was alive and well and really took over during the evening visit to the zoo. Ziegler delivered nothing less than a stellar performance through every song, even though I initially thought there were one too many original songs in the book (sorry Collins). The soundtrack makes for a great transportation back to the movie after having seen it, though the downfall is that it does not stand alone like the previous soundtracks in the franchise did. Oh, how I wish Lorde had returned, or even Coldplay.In regard to its faithfulness to the book, the movie did a decent job of retaining the truth from its source material. The only major complaint I had was the extreme passage of time during the third part. At the same time, I argue the lengths at which Collins spent in that third part could have been cut shorter, so I understand the choice to skip over some sections. There was also a lack of development regarding Corio's and Sejanus' friendship. It felt very low stakes and was probably underdeveloped due to the lack of time spent in Part 3. I also have to argue that the last scene (you know the one I'm talking about) was a forced perspective of Snow's, so the audience can only help but think he's in the right, that is unless you've read the book and can understand his irrational paranoia. I also believe there was some essential dialogue cut that Casca Highbottom says at the end that explains Snow's motivations. Alas they got most of the book right, enough for me not to notice anything else.Overall, The Balls of Songbirds & Snakes delivered on almost every promise that the previous Hunger Games movie couldn't. We saw plenty of the Capitol. The director/writer did a wonderful job at humanizing the tributes, something the other movies failed at, which is very meta as they talk about trying to do so in the very book itself. The movie did well being split into three separate parts, once again nodding to the source material. Even without the internal dialogue offered by the book, Blyth's downward spiral into the president we came to know back in 2012 was honest and believable. I enjoyed the nods to previous books and movies and certainly enjoyed the cameo at the end. I am not one to see movies twice in the theaters, but this one might deserve a second go.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Anurag-Shetty","21 November 2023","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is based on the novel of the same name, by Suzanne Collins. It is set 64 years before the events of The Hunger Games(2012). Coriolanus Snow(Tom Blyth) mentors District 12 tribute, Lucy Gray Baird(Rachel Zegler). Soon, he develops feelings for her.The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a good film. However, The Hunger Games(2012), The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1(2014) & The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2(2015) surpass this prequel by a huge margin. Director Francis Lawrence can't recapture lightning in a bottle, directing his fourth movie in the Hunger Games franchise. The first half of the film is mind-blowing. However, it goes off the rails in the second half. The movie gets super dragging & goes on & on, with no end in sight. Another negative is, there are too many songs for a Hunger Games film. The action set pieces are fantastic & look even better in IMAX. The visual effects are flawless. Tom Blyth is impressive as Coriolanus Snow. Rachel Zegler is brilliant as Lucy Gray Baird. Hunter Schafer is perfect as Tigris Snow. Viola Davis is spectacular as Dr. Volumnia Gaul. Peter Dinklage is outstanding as Dean Casca Highbottom. Josh Andres Rivera is superb as Sejanus Plinth. The supporting cast is unforgettable. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is worth a watch if you're a fan of the Hunger Games movies & novels. However, watch it with low expectations & you just might enjoy yourself.","

It was a very well done story, I like that they did it in parts to represent the phases that he goes through. As a fan of The Hunger Games you can identify each of the references to the original saga without feeling tired of it. ""The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is a unique and recommended cinematic experience. For fans of the saga, it offers an intriguing insight into the origins of an iconic character, while for new viewers, it is a chance to immerse themselves in a world where the complexity of the characters is intertwined with entertainment.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","JBLOSS","18 November 2023","I am not a huge fan of the Hunger Games franchise but have seen some of the other films. This effort felt overlong, I really can't see why they couldn't have told exactly the same story in 45 minutes less. There's too much filler and needless scenes that,if anything, should have been used to develop the characters more.The singing became a distraction and was overused, the violence was almost fetishised, with too much time and effort put into it at the expense of the relationships between the key characters. Plot twists and turns were never particularly explored or explained, and felt pretty arbitrary. I am guessing the book provides far greater depth than was achieved in this film.The lead actors never really achieved great chemistry and their relationship was, again pretty shallow to begin with,and wasn't given adequate time to grow and evolve.I can't say I hated the movie but I'd definitely not rush to watch it again, I doubt I'll remember much about it in a couple of weeks time.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","zakht","17 November 2023","I was pleasantly surprised with The Hunger Games: A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, in that it was a perfectly paced film, which balanced particularly dark action and thought-provoking themes very well. In addition, it set up the first The Hunger Games perfectly, something I felt the book was a little unclear on. I was worried that Lucy Gray's constant singing, as is in the book, would take over the film, but it was perfectly placed and necessary. All in all, a really entertaining watch for Hunger Games fans with some fantastic foreshadowing scenes and quotes that were far from cheesy. This felt like Suzanne Collins wrote the script, unlike in the Mockingjay Part 1 & 2 - a film definitely worth your time.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","nickryan-44535","17 November 2023","Stellar performances from everyone in this film. Tom Blyth really does a great performance as a young Snow and as the main character of this movie. I was not sure if I would be interested in a Snow origin story however the writers and Tom Blyth convinced me otherwise. While every actor holds their own it is no shock that Viola Davis is a standout as the evil doctor and might be my favorite performance of the entire movie.There is not much if anything I can critique about this film. Many having seemingly disliked Rachel Zegler's performance as the main female protagonist, but as someone who was not expecting much from this film I will say that she did very well. Not sure if they're expecting another Katniss but she is not that nor was she suppose to be. I will say that the biggest problem for me is the length of the film especially in the 3rd act. Various scenes could've been shortened particularly the singing scenes. It is definitely worth a watch in theaters it is a strong 7.5-8/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","healingtoolbox","18 November 2023","It's a savage, 1984 dystopian satire, on class inequality. Much of this comes from the unfamiliar and grand 1984 urban-scapes filmed in Poland and Germany.From another angle, it plays more like like a horror film; you wait for each young kid to be killed to find out how. It's dark, not a young adult action flick like the original Hunger Games trilogy or the first Mazerunner movie. Would have done better at box-office released in October for Halloween?Best acting is by an unrecognizable Viola Davis (The Woman King). She's a mad scientist supper-villain--yet, not over-done. If Donald Sutherland was 10/10 crazy, she takes ""unhinged"" to 11. Impressive. She commits to showing the ugliest and unpleasant aspect of dissociated economic elites.Using title cards, the movie is divided into three acts. The end of the second act is the highpoint of the film. DON'T MISS IT! Brilliant and amazing filmmaking! Afterwards, I was half ready for the credits to roll. Yet it goes on for another 45 minutes to show us how young Snow became old Snow in the trilogy.The King's Man (2021) had a similar problem. The film peaked at the end of the first act. For Hollywood blockbusters, both The King's Man and this film are original and narratively unorthodox. I believe the average male movie ticket buyer often perceives ""original"" movies as ""problematic."" The Creator (2023) also had originality audiences did not appreciate.Joss Whedon's scripting maxim still applies, to be big hits, a movie has to announce its genre to audiences; and then, ""stay within its lane,"" be creative with the tropes available to work with. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023) took Joss's advice to good effect.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","willphelan","18 November 2023","I never thought I needed another Hunger Games movie, especially a prequel without Jennifer Lawrence. However this movie was incredible and I feel like it added a lot to the franchise. Suzanne Collins added so much interesting depth and background for President Snow here and the script did a great job adapting her story. Collins doesn't get enough credit for how insightful and impactful her work really is. This movie is a slow burn where we see Snow fall into darkness and I love how subtle the character work is. He doesn't feel like he just snaps, it feels like a progression of his character as he interprets a new meaning of what the Hunger Games mean. Tom Blyth was phenomenal as a young Coriolanus Snow. He had so much range and we were able to understand how this villain we hate in the original movies was formed. His relationship with Lucy Gray was perfectly done. Say what you want about Rachel Zegler but she can ACT. She captured Lucy Gray so well and I love the incorporation of the musical performances. I thought it was really cool how we learn that Lucy values trust over love and the moment she feels she can't trust Snow, she turns on him. The impact this has on Snow is his final breaking point and I love how this scene is handled. The way she leaves him by singing the Hanging Tree is brilliant and adds so many layers to Snow's character in the original films. The entire supporting cast is also good, with Viola Davis being the standout. The action scenes are intense for the most part although I don't feel like the arena scenes were as good as the original movies. The film has excellent atmosphere building and the set design and costumes are top tier just like they always are in the Hunger Games franchise. Francis Lawrence once again did a great job directing. There were lots of great scenes and shots throughout. A highlight for me was the scene where Lucy is singing into the camera in the arena as the snakes sliver around her body. I thought the movie had some pacing issues but nothing that was really that big of a deal. Overall this was a prequel that is worthy of the originals while also telling its own great story. 8/10.","

So now the games are on, but nobody cares or watches because it's boring... much like the rest of the film. That's until Appalachian Gypsy Barbie shows up and sings DURING the reaping. Katniss might have had a whistle, but this girl gets to sing her little hillbilly heart out.3 unnecessary stories rolled into one dreadfully long movie filled with characters we never connect with. TBH the only one i cared about was Wovey and they did her dirty. They took that too far.3 hours of CGI and gratuitous solos by the obviously talented lead, but other than that her acting falls very very short. Zero chemistry between her and Snow and honestly I couldn't wait to leave. So we dipped out early because there's no way it got better.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Pjtaylor-96-138044","25 November 2023","I missed the start of this because for some reason the cinema didn't play any trailers, so I felt like I was playing catch up with the characters and their dynamics for a little while (I came in on the scene in which the mentors are told whom they're going to be mentoring, so I can't have missed that much). When the film was over, I worked out I must have only missed seven minutes, so I guess that most of the audience was playing catch up along with me (that can't be Lucy Gray's literal introduction, can it?). Basically what I'm saying is that a lot of the context I assumed I missed because I was late is actually just missing from the piece full stop, and it's something that plagues the entirety of the picture. Where 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014)' and 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)' ought to have been split into a single movie with a runtime not dissimilar from that of this film, 'The Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes (2023)' (that's one too many ""The""s, by the way) really ought to have been split into two separate movies with runtimes similar to those films. So much of this is far too rushed for its own good, and - although the flick hits the ground running and leaves little room for boredom, at least initially - this is ultimately the main flaw of the feature. There are plenty of genuinely interesting ideas at play here, with the picture following a character who comes to realise that his own self-interest might just take precedent over helping other people (or generally doing the right thing) when circumstances force him to choose between the two. Its grey morality is fairly refreshing, and having someone who isn't a hero be the protagonist of a wide-appeal blockbuster - particularly one based on young adult fiction - is quite ballsy. The problem is that none of its ideas get the time they need to feel fully formed. There's very little granularity to the character arcs and the most important relationships never feel genuine because they aren't really given all that much attention. There are solid scenes that focus on character work, but they're almost like milestones that the flick unceremoniously sprints past and are much harder to appreciate because of it. The film is at its best during the eponymous Hunger Games, as its distinct mentor-tribute relationship and Capitol-based perspective set it apart from the other films in its series. There's a lot of tension and suspense during this second act, and it generally keeps you on the edge of your seat. The pacy first part also features some compelling, if all too brief, set-up for this segment, establishing a more rudimentary rule set for the barbaric situation and having the lead make headway in transforming it into the entertainment-as-punishment we recognise from the other films in the franchise. It's all rather entertaining, even if it does leave you feeling a bit breathless. After the games, though, the feature slams on the brakes and slows to a crawl. The pacing almost entirely resets, and what follows is both too long to be an epilogue and too short to be its own thing. Again, it introduces some thoroughly intriguing ideas and it does have some really engaging moments, but it just doesn't have time to do anything with its ideas and ultimately ends with a bit of a whimper. That's not to say the ending is especially bad, but it does leave you thinking ""that's it?"" (despite the fact that it's technically quite well-rounded). The tragedy of the plot doesn't really come through as well as it ought to, and the ending doesn't have the intimacy in character behind it to justify its comparatively tiny scope. The formal successes of every technical department go under the radar, too, because of the underwhelming way in which the narrative is faithfully yet insufficiently adapted from the source material (which I haven't read). The writing really is the only thing holding this back, as it's a well-made effort with solid performances and some really entertaining sequences. It is enjoyable and some of it is surprisingly intellectually stimulating, but it could have been so much better with just a few small yet significant tweaks.P. S. It's kind of weird how it's essentially a musical, but I don't mind that.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","feliciastrand-71308","6 December 2023","So I saw the movie yesterday. I thought it was a decent (though bland) movie but it did feel like a long movie to me at times. I wondered when it was going to end which to me rarely is a good sign.The movie is made up of three acts if I remember correctly. I get the idea and it's not neccessarily bad but to me it felt like they were trying to smush together a bit too much in one movie. Since they have three acts to go through they can't get too detailed in each act. I felt like the hunger games for example were too quick and they didn't really put enough energy into it. It felt a bit vapid to me to be quite honest. The other acts also could be more detailed to get an even bigger feel for the characters.I would have prefered if the last act was it's own movie since it in a lot of moments felt rushed. I would have liked to see more character developement since the characters to me just over night became vastly different. To have a movie that picks up after the games and followed Snow's, Lucy Grey's and the other characters dealing with what happened would to me be better. That way you can properly explore the events and people.All in all the movie was decent but a bit bland to me. I didn't neccessarily dislike it. I have to say the actors did a great job though.","

The war still lays fresh in the minds of Capital citizen as the rebuild begins, yet the spirit of rebellion still lives in the Districts. Nobody has a full grasp on how to handle the controversial Hunger Games, or even if it will continue, yet the show goes on. IThen comes a young Coriolanus Snow, who revolutionizes the way the Games are approached while mentoring a young girl from District 12, Lucy Gray Baird. Here, the sadistic and narcissist mindset of the President Snow we love to hate is born. His keen insight and manipulative attitude develops into a killing spree born of a deep hunger for power.Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage are brilliant as usual. Not impressed with Rachel Zegler as lead actress (she is no Jennifer Lawrence after all), but Tom Blyth as Snow heads the cast well and encapsulates the persona of President Snow subtly as the film continues.Like I said, any novice Hunger Games fan can enjoy the fascinating and intriguing parallels between this film and the iconic trilogy. While it can never be compared to its successor, ""The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes"" brings justice to the Suzzane Collins' world.Yes, it's drawn out a bit in the middle... get over it.","

Nothing says blood and more blood than the fact that you cannot get it out, it leaves a nasty scar, and it stains too, not just on clothes, but your cold, cold heart.There is no wander Suzanne Collins wanted to revisit Panem, she wanted to tell the story of how one kid became a ruthless dictator and the why and how behind it. Now I refuse to sit here and tell the story, no I will let you be the judge and character of that. This prequel will not only be the greatest in this series, but I will say Francis Lawrence has done it yet again.Nothing screams blockbuster, then this one. This move has defied all odds or as the tagline for the series says, ""may the odds be ever in your favor."" The odds are that you will not survive the arena. The entire cast was just phenomenal and the storyline leading up to the first movie left a lot of holes filled in. This cast including the talented and most gorgeous one of all.... Ms. Viola Davis, she can be sinister and yes, I have seen it, but not this sinister. To the newcomer Tom Blyth, congratulations dude, you just made Donald Sutherland very proud.To the beautiful Rachel Zegler, I said this for West Side Story, and I will say it again, seductively incredible - I cannot begin to tell you how incredible you were. To the rest of the cast Peter Dinklage, Hunter Schaefer - awesome.Thank you, Suzanne, for bringing us back to Panem, we have lost it over the last 9 years since Mockingjay, Part 2 - thank you, thank you.This movie was in a word sinister and wonderful rise to the threat of Panem through the eyes of Coriolanus Snow.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","therealnerdypickle","17 February 2024","I LOVED this book, but if you didn't read it you would have NO idea what was going on. Even if you did, there's so many important details left out, this movie really should've been split into two. I was excited to watch this movie, but it was a HUGE let down. It has so many cuts and it feels very rushed unlike the amazing book it's based off of. It left out way too much and it felt like the spirit of the book was just excorsised out of this movie. Why? If you made 2 you'd be making more money anyway! You would give the plotline and world building more time, and make this feel way less rushed. And CLEMENSIA WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN AFTER THE STINKING SNAKE BITE!!! SHES VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN THE BOOK! AND SEJANUS' MOTHER? SHES ALSO VERY IMPORTANT! Anyways, to wrap up I do have to say that last scene where they run off (which was not like the book did it, I should've directed this movie) Lucy Gray is given a big awareness moment of ""Oh yeah maybe my big capital brainwashed boyfriend might murder me to get what he wants"" Props to Rachel Zegler for that, she got the suspicion in Lucy's character in that scene done well.","

I would watch it again and again. It's up there with Catching Fire honestly.Don't let bums on the internet convince you that this movie is mid or that anything about it isn't worth your time. It absolutely is worth your time & money & dedication.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","maleon-68612","2 January 2024","It wasn't bad, but not half as good as the novel. Many things are left out, other things are portrayed differently. Considering that adapting such a complex story is really difficult, I think they did quite a good job. Pacing was too fast obviously, which isn't surprising, a running time of 158 minutes just isn't enough to cover the 500+ pages the right way. I really liked Peter Dinklage as Highbottom, he did a brilliant job imo. The portrayal of Snow and Lucy Gray's love story seemed rush and unfitting.Yes, Rachel Zegler might not be the most likeable person, but I think it's stupid to review this movie based solely on how much you dislike Zegler. I highly recommend everyone to read the novel, doesn't matter if you enjoyed the movie or not.","

The movie stars of slow, getting to now the timeline we are in and the characters and than the plot starts picking up speed and we are in the Hunger Games again. I was a bit hesitant about this being a prequel of the original franshise movies but this absolutely did not disappoint. I hope this could be a start of a new streak of movies in the Hunger Games franshise.

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","TaylorYee94","23 December 2023","That's the whole point of this prequel, Snow's transition to embodiment of Lawful Evil, isn't it? 'The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes' should have been a series rather than a 150-minute movie. Francis Lawrence has so many things to tell and maintains the pace of the story, but at the last minute starting from 'Part 3: The Peacekeeper', he crams all those and develops so hastily that I am short of breath just by watching. What's with all the sudden change of emotions from all characters and rushed progress of plot? It loses all coherence and logic along the way.Ironically, this film makes me realize that Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Donald Sutherland trio is the best you can ask for. Lawrence and Hutcherson were about the same age and had similar duration of acting experience as Zegler and Blyth when they started the first movie of the Hunger Games franchise. They were brilliant and passionate afresh. Zegler's performance is especially disappointing.However, just like any other Hunger Games, the film offers exciting and spirited adventure, drama, and energy. The plot development for Part 1 & 2 is not bad.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","connor707","19 November 2023","As a fan of all four books, I felt that the original trilogy missed the mark at many moments and overall could not deliver all of the things that truly made the books great.This movie however, succeeded.Although much of the movie is condensed due to time constraints, I felt that this adaptation still preserved every important beat of the story and the tone of almost every scene. At the TBOSAS core, it is a story about Coriolanus' view of humanity and him ultimately coming to the conclusion, as is the point of the games, that humans are inherently evil and the world is cruel. In a cruel world with malevolent beings filling it, why not be the man in charge? Why not be cruel right back to the world and kill and starve others? This story shows Coriolanus get to this state of mind, however misguided his cognitive journey may be. It is the story of a man losing any semblance of morals he had and losing his own humanity in order to become the powerful villain of the main trilogy. 100% worth the watch (even if you did not read the book).","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","20 November 2023","64 years prior to the original we see what Panem was like in the early days of its fascist rule a mere 10 years after the civil war ended.Lucy Gray is a friendly, sweet travelling performer... with a distinct edge beneath. Rachel Zegler's singing and acting are excellent, though do take a few minutes to get used to, and certainly I get why some say that there are too many musical interludes here. I acknowledge that some of the things she's said show that she's not the best feminist yet - let's please keep in mind, she's 22 years old. I would definitely say she's well on her way. Give her some time to have more life experience and reflect on these things more, and I'm sure she'll get there.It has been 8 years since we last got an entry in this film series. Some would say that the moment has passed. And that this does not have enough new material to justify making it. That it smacks of corporate greed. In my opinion, this was the exact perfect time to make another one. Allow me to explain why.This is the first of these to be made after the PG-13 rating was pushed so far that it could properly allow for coming extremely close to showing the bloody violence that the subject matter requires. While this is not as intense as certain parts of the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, it is very obvious that it came out after that one, rather than shortly after the first one. The action and tension are the most visceral yet, and each death hits you like a sledgehammer. They're also the most clear and well-staged, easy to follow with one very effective long take.Some of the central issues that this franchise provides social commentary on have become worse and/or visible to a general audience. Regular people are forced to work ridiculously hard for less than a living wage, while the rich live a sheltered existence - it's very telling that several major characters in this feel no fear of actual danger, but instead consider their potential embarrassment to be a fate far worse than the certain death of 23 teenagers that had no way to avoid becoming Tributes.The youngest generations find themselves in a world where they have to be constantly camera ready, and the gig economy provides what little they have to live on. They either grow up too quickly or seemingly not at all, while their elders, those with significant power, who have created the current terrible conditions, judge them harshly, sitting in their ivory towers, insisting that it couldn't be any other way. 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow is influenced by several people in his life who try to encourage him to go in specific directions, and the potential for the future that he and his peers at least hypothetically hold is underlined; to either create a better society, or destroy all hope of it for generations to come - to let nationalists completely eliminate civil rights of anyone they deem lesser, or to wrestle back control.Those reporting on deadly conflicts may not actually care, or feel they have any skin in the game, and might treat it with little sensitivity, provide no context and simply try to get great ratings. There was never a long period of this movie that did not make me reflect on incredibly sad recent news stories. I understand that this is a negative for many, and I 100% respect those who disagree with the following; I don't go to movies to turn off my brain and be completely distracted from tough reality. I go for something that will help me process it better. And this absolutely delivered that.I recommend this to anyone who believes they can handle it - you'll know a few minutes in. 8/10.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","jp_91","27 November 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes"" is a good film that, as a prequel, managed to interest me in its story without having first seen the other films or read the ""The Hunger Games"" novels. The production is of a spectacular level, the script divided into three acts is effective, the first is dramatic and manages to generate sympathy with the main characters, the second act has good action scenes and manages to have good tension that makes you worry about the characters, but the third and last act is weak, slow but has well-directed dramatic moments. The performances are good, highlighting Rachel Zegler who also shows off her voice in several songs, and Viola Davis brings to life a unique character. The cinematography is not excellent but it does its job. The music composed for the film is its greatest success, highlighting the dramatic, action and suspense scenes. A film that manages to be good, but could have gone further with a better structured script in its final act.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","neil-476","1 December 2023","In the early days of the Hunger Games, poorly-off Panem Capital aristo Coriolanus Snow becomes mentor to District 12 tribute Lucy Grey Baird. In the course of trying new ideas, such as getting the audience to like Lucy (she's a good singer), he falls for her and determines to make sure she survives.I quite enjoyed the books and the previous films so I was up for a prequel (I haven't read the prequel novel). And it's not bad. The war is much more recent, which shows everywhere - even the capital is somewhat down-at-heel. Everything is considerably lower tech, and the film portrays a believable earlier era to what we have previously seen.The cast are fine, with Peter Dinklage's final scene showing what a great actor he is, and Viola Davies delivering a character even more cold-blooded and scary than Amanda Waller.And the story is involving and often goes in unexpected directions. At 150+ minutes, my attention never wandered.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","beckstacyeliza","19 November 2023","This movie could have stood to be thirty minutes to an hour shorter. Two and half hours is plenty of time to develop a little backstory on more characters than just Snow. In the original films, I feel like they were able to help people get to know and understand a lot of the main characters. In this prequel, the only people we really come to understand are Snow, Tigress, and Plinth. I wish they would have showed more of the past of Lucy, the original game maker, and even some of the other hunger games tributes. Even the game maker with all her creatures-I wish they would have given even a line as to why she's into that stuff and how she got into it.As for the singing, I found it all very annoying and cringey. Most of the songs actually have a positive tone, which is strange for such a dark story. Lucy also chooses to sing at times that are really weird and don't make sense. She's also exaggerated-her southern accent, her personality, her facial expressions, everything. It's like I'm watching a musical rather than a serious movie. It's also like if you go to Disney and see performers put on a show and do a musical number for guests-it's that over the top. Also, I wish Lucy just used a flat, America/midwest kind of accent-that would have made it 100% better.Lastly, without giving spoilers, Snow makes some decisions that impact his trajectory and I wish they would have had some more lead up to those decisions. Like there isn't enough character development to get him there on some of those early decisions. I think things all end up making sense in the end, but it was a tough journey for the audience keeping with the story to get there. I know some reviews say the movie is true to the books and even some people behind me said ""that was so good!"" So maybe I just don't like the story. You'll have to decide for yourself.","

I know its a hype to hate stuff without decent reasons for the last few years but its getting ridiculous even with great movies.This movie does a perfect job of showing us how, Snow became the hatefull man we know him as i even sympathize with him a little bit .It also shows us how the capitol got tricked in liking the anual hunger games and making it more of a show then just killing.On top of that there are alot of easter eggs/ refferences to the movies we already have , so watch the movie and dont listen to the BS negative reviews.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","alyssafrantz","20 November 2023","I never read the book but I heard the movie adaptation is very close. If that's the case, the book must be incredibly boring. I'll admit the cinematography was great and it looked good. But the acting of a lot of the characters was not great, the purpose of the sister and grandma was 1000% missing - they might've well not been in the story at all, and after the actual games, you'd think Lucy Gray would be traumatized and have a hard time going back to her life. Nope! Not at all. This film was basically two films - the half before the games at the capital, and the half after they got to District 12. There was no connection in the two halves. BUT THE MOST ANNOYING PART: the main character NEVER PICKED A SIDE. It was impossible to pick apart his M. O., he got upset over things he caused and knew would happen (""uh oh, if it isn't the consequences to my own actions""), any character change happened offscreen, and he gave us no reason to root for him. I would've loved to see a slow burn to the crazed, evil Snow that we know from the trilogy. But there was no inciting incident that caused that. Also, Lucy Gray's actress has a beautiful voice, but there was too much singing in the movie, it was awkward, and didn't seem realistic at all.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","mieriks","1 January 2024","This movie, about Coriolanus Snow who mentors and develops feelings for the female District 12 tribute during the 10th Hunger Games, is a great prequel to The Hunger Games (2012)!There's not a lot that needs to be said because there's only a few flaws, I think. One thing that I think is both a drawback and a great achievement at the same time is the character development, which is basically the main plot of the movie. I honestly think the series' original antagonist's psychological development from being ""good"" to ""bad"" may feel a bit too short for a single movie to be, but at the same time it's well executed for the 2 hours and 37 minutes it's been given. It can feel slightly rushed in therms of the big picture, but the scenes themselves that focus on Coriolanus' development is captivating, I think.Otherwise, I think the script is well written, the characters are interesting, Tom Blyth (as Coriolanus Snow) is the perfect cast for the protagonist, Coriolanus, most of the other actors also give good performances with especially Rachel Zegler's (as Lucy Gray Baird) beautiful voice, the cinematography is fantastic despite that I usually don't like wide angles, the scenery and costumes are gorgeous, and of course the score is beautiful as always. So overall, the movie is a worthy installment of The Hunger Games Pentalogy (2012-2023)!This is a captivating prequel that effectively delves into the origins of President Snow, despite the slightly rushed character development. The movie's strong script, compelling characters, and stunning visuals make it a worthy addition to The Hunger Games Pentalogy.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","akoaytao1234","20 November 2023","Ballad of Songbirds preludes the original series, mostly focusing on hw Snow came to be. Its the tenth Hunger Games, and people had enough of the games. No one is watching AND a group of elite students are forced to join forces with the Hunger Games participants to get a coveted scholarship AND make changes to improve the games. A young Snow meets a young district 12 tribute and develop a relationship which would force them to reckon what each other truly loves first.There somethings special about this film that works wonderfully.In the world of quick Marvel thrill, this slow burn epic character study has lost its way in the screen. There is stakes there is real difference in agenda AND I like that. I think the original series has this grand scheme that does work well since its message is clear BUT this film feels much more pointed. The violence here feels wretched compared to the original. It is inherently darker and hopeless. The lack of technology makes things much less surreal than the original.Snow here, is almost similar to what he'll be in the future BUT he still has this sort of finding his footing. His pragmatic and knows his limitation. He is priviledged enough to study in a prestigious school but is not rich enough to really go for broke with his ideas. He is still beneath most of them. When given a chance to find a way to get a scholarship he clearly needs, he step forward AND find himself too entangled. He develops a selffish love for someone who truly wants to live and win BUT whose heart lays close to her home.I know there is a clear criticism that can be laid on some parts of the film. The third act does swerve pace wise, and feels almost like a seperate story that felt too rushed. While I do not consider it as bad per se, but I feel that there are ways to continue the stakes of the first 2/3 of the film AND improve the overall . The singing too can be bothersome and does feel Glee TV-like.Otherwise, big kudos to Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler. They really made the film. The film is not perfect but they are able to perfectly encapsulate the moods the shifts of the film. Its definitely not cookie cutter stuff. Though, Josh Andres Rivera was not fit to do the heavy lifting to show the needed conflict in the latter part of the film. I LOVE ZANY VIOLA DAVIS and JASON SCHWARTZMANN. I like when they camps it up but not so much.Highly recommended. Probably one of the better big budget films in the longest while. BUT I do feel this needs a BASIC knowledge of the Hunger Games Series.","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","katherinelangen-26180","20 November 2023","I think it stayed as true to the book as the length of the movie would allow. There had to be a lot of adapting to fit 500+ pages in a 2.5 hour movie.That being said, I don't think they did a great job of conveying Snow's internal struggle. Love vs His Future. Human Decency vs Power. His Past vs His Present. He was CONSTANTLY torn in the book.Throughout the book, you wondered how he would eventually turn ""bad"". His journey and eventual decision makes sense and doesn't seem quick and sudden. There doesn't seem to be an obvious character arc in the movie that shows his change.At the end of the movie, Snow's ""betrayal"" and reaction towards Lucy may seem confusing and rushed if you don't have background from reading the book. You don't really know how much Lucy means to him and how shocking that ending should be.It's a good adaptation, but it's definitely not the best Hunger Games movie!","

"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes","Mysterygeneration","18 November 2023","Laughing until we pass out. Similar to ""Harry Potter,"" the book series whose popularity in Hollywood allowed for the creation of this franchise, the big-screen adaptations made several mistakes before finding success with a single filmmaker, who is now back to helm a prequel that remarkably expands the canon while adhering to its basic ideas.""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" strikes a balance between political commentary at a level appropriate for young viewers while also honoring blood sport and young love, as only Collins can. It feels like a logical continuation of the narrative. Her message is more about identifying how institutions use entertainment to divert attention from and control the masses than it is about opposing fascism. Collins does, however, allow a soulful folk singer-the title's figurative songbird-to act as the voice of resistance even inside that critique.Rachel Zegler, the star of ""West Side Story,"" pays grudging homage to Lucy Gray Baird. She is a hybrid of Jennifer Lawrence's selfless hero Katniss Everdeen from the original films, Victor Hugo's enthralling Gypsy Esmeralda, and a pop icon like Taylor Swift who unites people. Her songs are the high point of a gloomy thriller that is overly drawn out by thirty minutes and becomes incredibly confusing towards the end. However, Hollywood has long since concluded that people enjoy their blockbusters obese, and ""Ballad"" is just the most recent example of over-delivering.There's just one character in ""Ballad"" that viewers will recognize immediately: Coriolanus Snow, the future dictator (played by Donald Sutherland), who is now an underdog cadet. This implies that, similar to ""Cruella,"" ""Wicked,"" and ""Maleficent,"" the main character in the movie is a villain who was once youthful, desperate, and... attractive.",NA
