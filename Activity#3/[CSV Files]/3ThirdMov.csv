"Escape Room","rustonreviews","9 February 2019","Drawing influences from Saw (2004), Final Destination (2000), and Cube (1997), Escape Room follows six individuals, all of whom receive a puzzle box prescribing a cryptic note inviting them to the Minos Escape Room Facility. Lured to the facility under the promise of receiving a cash prize of ten thousand dollars, these six strangers must endure several intricately designed puzzle rooms in a thrilling game of life or death. While the premise doesn't exactly scream originality, Escape Room is a perfectly enjoyable little thriller. For those expecting buckets of gore and sickening death scenes, look elsewhere, as Schut and Melnik's screenplay is much more attuned to focusing on the elaborate puzzles themselves, resulting in a film that intrigues rather than disturbs. Pace wise, the film doesn't slow down and is engaging throughout, some of the puzzle rooms are quite visually arresting, and thankfully the characters aren't just one dimensional zeroes either. While the ending does border on nonsensical, Escape Room is a still a fun film that is definitely worth checking out.","

"Escape Room","Prismark10","8 February 2020","Six people receive a mysterious box. It contains a chance to win ten thousand dollars. As the strangers arrive in a nondescript building and wait in a reception area.They certainly find themselves locked in a series of escape rooms with fiendish traps and small clues. However this is no game, the penalty for failure is death.Escape Room is reminiscent of the cult movie Cube. There are hints that the six people could be trapped in purgatory. We see flashbacks that they were all involved in some life threatening event where they may or could had perished.Escape Room in its own term is better than a lot of low budget horror/thrillers. It is not as gory or nasty as the Saw movies.It is competently entertaining with a subtext regarding pleasing the elites.","

"Escape Room","CronenbergsMonster","12 August 2020","Dont believe the 10/10 or the 1/10 reviews. This movie falls almost squarely in the middle. The premise is essentially a PG-13 Saw movie with multiple puzzle rooms for the protagonists to escape (rather than torture devices). There are some really great set pieces, tense moments, and decent acting throughout. However, the film completely falls apart in the last act. Its clearly meant to be setup for a franchise, which completely belittles everything in the first 3/4 of the film and ruins all the goodwill established up to that point. This could have been a really competent thriller if it werent for the money-grabbing shill of an ending. As it stands, this is basically a sub-par ""Cube."" 5/10 for me; I cant fully recommend it.","

"Escape Room","Leofwine_draca","3 February 2020","ESCAPE ROOM is a generic kind of thriller that trades on the newfound popularity of thriller experiences, in which a group of friends willingly allow themselves to be locked in escape rooms before solving puzzles to facilitate their escape. A real-life CRYSTAL MAZE, if you will. I've seen a previous and very similar B-movie that wasn't very good, but this one is more mainstream and bigger budgeted, so there's more emphasis on effects. I found it quite similar to that '90s cult classic CUBE, although of course nowhere near as good, lacking as it does interesting characters and only tending to generate a minimum of suspense despite all the screaming and shouting.","

The writing was a tad lackluster in some parts, but overall it didn't kill the mood. Same can be said about predictability, but again, it didn't ruin the film.
Set design was excellent, and each room/game was well put together. It also managed to keep the tension at a fun level throughout. I'll definitely be watching the sequel when (or if) it gets released.","

"Escape Room","SnoopyStyle","3 September 2019","Six strangers are given mystery boxes that invite them to win $10k. Each one arrive at an office building. As they wait in a room, they find the door locked with the heat rising. They struggle to escape and find themselves trapped in a series of elaborate rooms.This reminds me of Cube. At least in that one, the movie doesn't waste time introducing the characters. The opening foreshadowing sequence reveals almost everything. I kept waiting for a surprise reveal that the other competitors were not actually killed. Maybe they deliberately did not show a irrevocable death on screen to highlight a red herring. I don't care about these people. They are annoying. Everybody has a rude comment or a sly joke. The group dynamics could work with one jerk but almost everybody seems to have a jerk mode. They need to chill. As for the room designs, they are the most appealing aspect of the movie. They are fascinating although the clues are basically random. In Cube, there is actually something to solve. In this one, there isn't much to solve. I also hate that the players don't try to bring useful items from one room to another. It's rather unrealistic that everybody walks out of the cabin into the woods without grabbing a blanket or rug. At the very least, someone would brace the door open. The room designs are inventive and pretty fun. That keeps my interest until the end.","

"Escape Room","cruise01","5 January 2019","Escape Room (4 out of 5 stars).Escape Room is a twisted and fun thriller film that lacks the originality of the concept since there are films like Saw, The Collector, and The Belko Experiment. But the film does not stop you from being entertained with a thrilling direction that does keep you on the edge of your seat and plays around with the concept of characters going through several escape rooms and puzzle solving. If they fail to solve in time or escape, there are some deadly consequences.The plot follows several characters Zoey (Taylor Russell), Ben (Logan Miller), Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll), Mike (Tyler Labine), Jason (Jay Ellis), and Danny (Nik Dodani) all getting an invitation puzzle box that invites them to an escape room experience. If they get out, they will win 10,000 dollars. Right when they go to the destination and waiting in the first room. That is were the games begin. They will have to use their knowledge and problem solving to get through each room before they fall for the trap. With each room and puzzle solving involving a secret of their past. They figure out there is something bigger going on than just an escape room game.The plot was good. It may not be fresh of an original idea. But it was entertaining to see several strangers trying to figure out the clues and survive. Each character has their own backstory of a tragic past that lead them to this game. Each character all has their own distinct personality on how they try to survive. Zoey is a sweet, intelligent college student. Ben is an alcoholic and a dead beat teenager. Amanda was in the military. Mike is a truck driver. Jason is a financing businessman with a selfish attitude. Danny is the geeky teenager who is obsessed with problem solving. But how are all these characters connected? Or what they have in common? The build up with the plot was good. As they go from one deadly room to another. From a room that is firing up in high temperatures to a frozen lake that is breaking apart to an upside down bar and a white static sound room that may not be for the sensitive audience that can not handle flashy dizzying lights.Taylor Russell was good playing her character that is pushed to her limits as she progressed through the games. Logan Miller, Deborah Ann Woll, Tyler Labine, Jay Ellis, and Nik Dodani were all good with their characters.Director Adam Robitel did well in building the suspense and thrills. As characters are facing danger in every room. The direction did well in making you feel claustrophobic or fear of falling from an upside down room. The opening scene with a character being crushed from a room with walls closing in does set the momentum of the suspenseful direction. The music score Brian Tyler and John Carey also helped creating the tone with each room.I did feel like the twist was a bit far fetched with the last ten minutes of the movie. Without giving away spoilers about the idea of the escape rooms and the ending. Yes, it does leave room for a sequel. I was disappointed and the twist did not leave that surprising shock feeling at all.Overall, Escape Room is a good psychological horror film. The cast was great. The script and plot was good with having several strange characters playing a deadly game. The direction did have suspense and thrills that was entertaining. Twist may have been the weakest link in the movie. But it was still a fun good time watching the movie.","

"Escape Room","danielmanson","29 December 2020","As the title suggests this film is about a 6.5/10 so I'll be nice and plonk it on 7.I'll just jump right into what annoyed me and there was 2 glaringly annoying parts of this film which lets it down. The first is the very first scene, I won't give spoilers but it does the classic ""shows one of the final scenes of the film first"", all this did was eliminate a lot of the surprise and tension as you know full well what the outcome of the characters will be. The second is that throughout the film, more so the 2nd half of it, you're expecting some huge twist to the plot and it just doesn't arrive, so the ending is just underwhelming. It sets for a sequel as well which I find pointless.The film does have good parts and the plot does contain a couple of interesting points which give this ""saw"" plot a bit of depth. The character depth is quite good as well I thought considering it's hard to portray that in such a linear plot. Overall though I think it's just a simple thriller/horror that you can sit back and relax whilst watching. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination and contrary to what I said in the first paragraph I did enjoy my time watching this, so I'll give it a 6.5/10.","

"Escape Room","funnycommentor","19 July 2023","First of all, when I first watched the trailer of the movie I really liked it and I was so hyped about that movie! The plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious, but not really innovative (because, there are too many escape room movies). The storyline was very well written, really clever and everything was well-explained. The characters were unexpectedly interesting, well-developed and some of them were really likeable (especially, Zoe). The filming location of the movie was mainly, inside the escape room. The casting was nice and their acting was really good, each actor/actress portrayed their character perfectly. It was a very intense movie, action-filled and most escape rooms were super innovative and mind-blowing. The killcount of the movie wasn't really bloody nor gory, but most death scenes were super intense. The opening scene of the movie was definitely unpredictable, super intense and very shocking. The ending twist was really good and definitely unexpected, I really enjoyed it. Overall, it was an enjoyable action movie, very intense and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.","

"Escape Room","Gordon-11","23 March 2019","This film tells the story of a group of six people entering a deadly escape game.The story is really intense. The billiard room scene makes my palms sweat like there's no tomorrow, which is a very rare occurrence. It is reminiscent of ""The Cube"", only better. However, the ending from the big room onwards makes little sense, and is full of plot holes. If the film just stopped at the point when the person enters the big room, it would have been even better.","

With horror movies, I never get my hopes up as it's hard to find a good one these days. I surprisingly really enjoyed the concept of this movie and would consider it more of a thriller. It never bored me and it wasn't gory like the saw films (which I never enjoyed). I liked the characters and their backgrounds.. it was nice to see how they all tied in together. It was a pretty good movie and I'd recommend.","

"Escape Room","Netscape_Navigator","25 October 2021","This was fun and suspenseful. The characters are written in a very basic way, but just enough to move along with the plot.The most annoying character was the businessman. It's unrealistic that a person in that position wouldn't know how to talk to other humans. In general, the writers had characters say things that made so little sense. For example, the businessman made a comment about ""survival of the fittest,"" after one of their friends had died, except she died sacrificing herself. One of the characters corrects him on that, and so then he says let's not waste her sacrifice. Ok, that line makes sense, but why would he even say that first line in the first place?There was another part where the businessman tried to insinuate that another character had caused the death of another. So that character the starts defending himself, and the businessman cuts him off and says to forget all that and to get back on task or something. Wait, YOU'RE the one that just accused him of MURDER, what do you mean ""forget all that,"" ***you're the one that brought it up.***The biggest thing that annoyed me was the way the girl reacted at the end when she went with the police back to the initial escape room, which is now in a completely burned up state since that's how they left it originally (it burned up after they left). She storms in and starts frantically talking about how this was the lobby, and how such and such was over here, and just going on and on. Let me break this down....* First off, why is she so SURPRISED that the room looks like this now?? How's it supposed to look? You have no idea exactly what happened to the place after you and your friends crawled through the duct. But, you have some idea that it probably burned right? Then.....how is the way the room looks now NOT consistent with that? In other words, what is it about the way the room looks now that immediately triggered her alarm bells that ""omg, someone is trying to cover their tracks by making it look like the escape room never existed and that I'm crazy."" What are you talking about, this looks EXACTLY the way I'd expect an escape room to look after an inferno had gone through it. And if she didn't know that an inferno had gone through it, then she has even less reason to be surprised about the way it looks now since she has no idea what happened to it after they left. It looks like a crazy room where crazy stuff happened. Her reaction would've made more sense if the place had been in *pristine* condition.* She's frantically going on and on about what the room looked like as if someone had already doubted her. No one had even said anything yet, and she's already reacting like her story is suspicious, trying with all her might to convince people that for all she knew, already believed her.* When she does mention some area of the room and what it used to be, the policeman IMMEDIATELY says there's no evidence of that. So that's it. You're not going to ask any questions, you just immediately assume she must be crazy?It's really not that hard to write good dialogue. Yes, it's hard to write a story, but dialogue isn't hard. You just picture what a normal human being would say given that circumstance, however fantastical or not.","

"Escape Room","Sleepin_Dragon","30 December 2020","I was adamant that I had seen this film, until I realised I had seen a film a few years back, called Escape Room, with virtually the same plot, the difference, being that was poor, this was actually really good.It's up there with Saw in terms of quality, it truly is a good thriller film, I wouldn't class it as a horror, it has tones, but ultimately lacks the scares.The format is unoriginal, but the delivery, acting, production and finished products are all really good. The only thing that didn't work quite so well for me was the ending, but in nitpicking here, it was a very good film, I wasn't expecting to like it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. 8/10.","

"Escape Room","rgkarim","4 January 2019","The age of horror took a major turn when the Saw series unleashed its gory thrills to the Hollywood industry. Sadly, the very edge and gimmicks it brought grew stale, as sequel after sequel appeared to dilute the quality and originality. Soon carbon copies came in, eventually flooding the market with mediocre films that didn't do much to progress the genre. Still, there are always those hopes that some quality still lurks in the chaotic slew that is this genre. Hi, Robbie K here with his first review of the year on the latest Horror movie entitled:Movie: Escape Room (2019)Director:
Adam Robitel
Writers:
Bragi F. Schut (screenplay by) (as Bragi Schut), Maria Melnik (screenplay by)
Stars:
Deborah Ann Woll, Taylor Russell, Tyler LabineLIKES:New Twist
Attention To Detail/Creativity
Good Acting
Character Development
Story
Stuck To Gimmick
Suspenseful Energy
Short Run TimeSUMMARY: These types of films fall victim to stale presentations and lack of originality. As such, the Escape Room approach was a nice twist on this film bringing with it a new creativity and approach that was refreshing. Each of the rooms had extraordinary detail, planned out to feel like the intense game of survival, filled with snares, baits, and clues to spur the threats on. Such design brought with it new arenas to engage your mind and held much more sustenance.
What further advanced the story were the characters, contenders who for once had more dimension than simple, snobbish, cannon fodder that often take center stage. These players held backstories, opportunities to learn, and personalities that evolved with each passing minute. As such, I found myself rooting for the team to succeed instead of rooting for a timely demise to end their flawed personalities. The actors had more room to use their talents to cross the spectrum and do a surprising job expanding upon what was once simple roles.
Tying all of this together those, was an engaging story that managed to combine all the backstories, gimmicks, and flair into an engaging cinematic piece that delivered on its promise, but remained interesting on many levels. Uncovering the mysteries, solving the clues, and keeping the energy flowing through the film with a presentation that was filled with anticipation and excitement. Given that they balanced the gimmick with a story it gets bonus points, even more so keeping it in the short run time leads to even more bonus points.DISLIKES:
Cliché
A few stretches
Wanting More Backstory for some characters
Ruined by TrailersSUMMARY: Sadly, all the planning and details laid out still haven't escaped the cliché and unoriginality that follows these types of films. Escape Room falls into these own sets of traps, but fortunately the spin, ingenuity, and suspense are able to divert the blunt of this area of improvement. One of those that is a bit eye rolling, is that the rooms takes some stretches of the imagination and ignoring reality to get on board. While most of it is acceptable, there are some times I had to turn my brain off extra to get over the unrealistic hurdle.
In addition, there was a little bit of adjusting the story order I would have liked to see, placing all the character stories closer to the beginning where their lives were explained in more detail. Had they done this, I feel some of the parts rushed over for me would have been improved, but this minor detail is nothing compared to my big limitation. That much of the story, twists, and fates have been revealed in the trailers to great detail. If you've got a good memory, and watch the trailer with enough focus, you'll get about 60-75% of the movie revealed. So avoid the trailers enough and you will be okay, but otherwise look forward to the last 25% to really give you the last tidbits.The VERDICT:This genre is what you pay for, but fortunately Escape Room renews the potential for greatness in this type of movie. With a focus on detail, character designs, and story integration this addition to the group was fantastic for me. It's engaging pace and suspenseful energy will offset most of the film's limitations. Given all the visuals and fun I had, the movie is well worth a trip to the theater and certainly one of the better horror movies to show up in a while, at least in terms of thriller/slasher. I certainly enjoyed this film and look forward to this direction for future installments if possible. My scores are:Drama/Horror/Mystery: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0","

We are introduced to three people who have the potential of being the ""Final Girl."" One of which is Ben. Zoey (Taylor Russell) is a super smart student and Jason (Jay Ellis) is a shrewd businessman. They and others get a personal invitation to try the Minos Escape Room for a chance of a $10,000 prize. The rooms can be deadly as they soon discover and the numbers whittle down.We get to know more personal information at 66 minutes into the film as we discover a reason for the madness.How many films have the title ""Escape Room"" right now? It seems the craze has pushed the success of any film with the title, almost as bad as the numerous ""Truth or Dare"" films. Then there is ""No Escape Room."" Guess how that one ends Scooby-doo? Sorry for the spoiler.I admit I rather enjoyed the film. It is not really horror, but more of a thriller.

"Escape Room","dynamiteheaddy-43387","1 February 2019","Starts off fairly strong with interesting escape rooms but there comes a point in the third act where the movie just goes badly down hill with one of the worst endings in recent memory. They are clearly trying to set up a franchise with the sequel bait but with an ending this weak and unoriginal I can't see anyone wanting to watch it, The film isn't clever and doesn't have a decent twist to save it. Its just a rip off Saw (minus the gore) probably in the hope they can make more money. It's a shame because there are some enjoyable parts but expect any future films to go straight to DVD.","

Escape Room gives you a intense thrill that is similar to Old (not quite as good but Escape Room's ending is better). Escape Room probably scrapes it's way to my top 15 movies, and that's saying a lot. I love Escape Room! I love it's idea, it's escape rooms, the action, the phsyco people, everything about it.

"Escape Room","ridi-arahan","11 June 2020","What worked:
it's a rollercoster ride; you just buckle you seat belt and enjoy the show. What worked than any other movies with the same theme is giving background story, show empathy for the characters and making them work as a team for the most part. It's exciting, thrilling and maybe a bit predictable at parts but the movie as a whole worked.What did not work:
anti climatic; maybe the conclusion of the puzzle could have been stronger, with convincing scenes leading to the end. Also, the ending of the movie shows there is a sequel coming up but I did not get why they are filming an action sequence when the real event is meant to destroy the whole plane in real.Final verdict: it's an exciting movie","

"Escape Room","thebricks","5 January 2019","I loved the first Saw movie, but got tired of subsequent movies because the gore and torture got a bit too much to watch. It actually was a decent movie and is kind of rewatchable, I'll admit. I did feel at times that the characters were a bit too smart to discover certain things as quickly as they did. Still, for a January release, you expect the worst but it actually was pretty good.Many of the leads were unlikable, but that's to be expected with budget movies like this. Also, it's written like a teen movie, where people are losers one day, white collar successes the next, which is ridiculous, but that's Hollywood. Getting past this, it still is a pretty good watch and a way to waste two hours.","

"Escape Room","burlesonjesse5","9 January 2019","Six strangers are promised $10,000 if they can unknowingly win a life and death game. They have to exhaustively find their way out of a Minos Escape Room Facility in downtown Chicago (ah, yet another freaking movie that takes place in yet doesn't echo The Windy City). That's the rub of Escape Room, my latest review. In truth, I found ""Escape"" to be as disturbing or upsetting as any PG-13 endeavor I've ever seen. After viewing it, you might think twice about entering any sterile office building with I guess, one creepy employee and a butt load of surveillance.Released in January yet better than your typical January ""junk"", Escape Room revitalizes the helplessly trapped, twenty-something genre. Bucked with a hint of originality, it has elements of stuff like The Game, The Belko Experiment, any Saw sequel, 1997's Cube, and even The Breakfast Club (go with me on this one). With ""Escape"", director Adam Robitel gives us a nifty little thriller that resembles the aforementioned but in good taste. He piles on the tension, effectively inserts flashbacks, avoids any bloodstained gore, and provides riotous set designs with mounds of verve. Credit also goes to the performance of Taylor Russell as Escape Room's reserved contestant named Zoey. Russell goes from timid physics student to gun-toting badass as the film readily wears on. It's a heck of a transformation.So yeah, ""Escape's"" polar characters walk the fine line between being annoying bickers and nervous humorists. And yes, Escape Room's last act piles on twists, turns, and implausible revelations just for the heck of it (the whole diegesis might have been a hallucination or an experimental fugazi, seriously?). Still, this flick with its fringe booby traps, its inventive shocks, and its remorseless cantering keeps you enthralled for 75% of the running time. Yup, I'm down for joining this ""Escape Club"" (that's a reference to an English pop band from the 80's if you didn't already know). My rating: 3 stars.","

The fact that it sequel baits you hard at the end is also a little insulting. Save your money. Do a real escape room instead.","

The acting was superb, the plot was interesting.It does feel a little like a mix of a couple of other films but that did not stop me from enjoying it.The ending is a bit of a stretch and obviously a setup for a sequel, but it worked.Go see it for fun!","

"Escape Room","svhot","9 January 2019","Two thumbs up from me to the story-writer(s) , director , and producer of this new modern masterpiece movie titled ""Escape Room"". I thank the story-writer(s) for writing such a fresh story in the horror-thriller genre ; I thank the director for skillfully and brilliantly presenting this story on-screen ; and I thank the producer(s) for having faith in such a story.I really liked the fact that viewers of ""Escape Room"" were simultaneously involved in solving the mystery, together with the characters of the movie. I appreciated the revealing of various clues, backstories of the movie's characters, the characters' development as the story progresses, and well-paced screenplay. The only negative criticism I have is about the movie's ending - the ending could have been better ; Maybe the makers are trying to give hints that a sequel is in the pipeline. Anyway, overall, this is a very good, fresh entry in the horror genre.","

"Escape Room","andyajoflaherty","12 May 2023","I just randomly came across this on Netflix so decided to give it a go. You can probably guess the premise from the name alone, 6 strangers get invited to an escape room challenge, the winner getting a cash prize. However, instead of being the usual fare, the rooms are actually extremely deadly, and soon the participants are playing for their lives.I must say, I actually quite liked this. It was just the right amounts of absurd and goofy to offset the tension, and the performances and effects were pretty decent for a low budget horror. If you're in the market for a brief but decent horror then you can certainly do worse.","

"Escape Room","Groverdox","5 September 2020","""Escape Room"" is a forgettable would-be thriller which fails to do anything interesting with its premise.It assembles the typical disparate group of characters, whose attempts at showcasing their individuality is more annoying than enlightening. The way the characters grate on each other grated on me also.The plot is something to do with said characters taking part in a game where they are locked in a series of life-threatening rooms and have to figure out how to escape.The movie just goes too far outside the realm of possibility for it to be worth engaging with. It doesn't play by any set rules, and just feels lazy as a result, like they had an idea, and couldn't be bothered figuring out how to make it work.Hard to believe there's a sequel coming. I wouldn't have thought this would have been successful enough to warrant that.","

"Escape Room","eparazak","4 January 2019","From the director of last year's ""Insidious: The Last Key"" comes Escape Room. This movie is about six different people who receive a cube through an unknown identity and are then invited to take part in an escape room challenge. If they lose, their lives are claimed.I went into this movie thinking it would be an intense, fun movie that would brighten up the mood for what's to come in the cinema. In a way, it gives us that, but when thinking about it, this movie also suffers from a large share of problems.This movie's biggest strength has got to be the tension that rises with the continuation of the movie. The situations that the main characters get stuck in are highly gripping and even a little discomforting. I think the movie handled this part excellently. Of the six main characters, there are two of them that stick out and act as very believable and had me rooting for them in particular. I think this is due to how they're better established than the others. As much as this is a benefit, this also does make the movie's end result feel predictable. I find the first half better however simply because of the fact that the movie seems to lose its momentum in the second one.I mention in the headline that the movie is pretty dumb in a lot of ways. I'm not simply talking about the decisions the characters take either. Yes, the characters make a lot of dumb and nonsensical decision during the second half, but there area bunch of other decisions that ruin the movie for me. I will talk briefly about them without spoiling. The motivation for bringing the characters together is generic and stupid. There is something that happens with the female lead in the last 15 minutes that makes no sense. Finally, the ending scenes seem to exist simply to set up a sequel and a franchise. The latter also feels last minute and that it was done in one draft considering that I was very confused while watching it.Look, if you just want a mindless thriller that you can watch and have fun with, this may be up your alley. Heck I would even agree with that statement myself, however, the second half really ruined it for me.4/10","

"Escape Room","Wizard-8","10 October 2019","It seems the maker of this movie got quite a bit of inspiration from past movies, most notably ""Saw"" and ""Cube"". Those two aforementioned movies managed to be effective at times despite being made with really low budgets. So it's really strange to realize that ""Escape Room"" is much less effective despite having a much higher budget. I think that having much more money backfired because it caused these filmmakers to go ""wild"", having much bigger setpieces and challenges for their characters. As a result, the movie becomes increasingly harder to swallow as it goes along, because you simply won't believe that ANYONE would go to all the trouble to inflict this particular type of deadly terror on the protagonists. Sure, I admit that I was never bored at any point, but it was hard to care about the characters or the situation because almost everything was quite unbelievable. If you must watch this movie, it's best reserved when you're in a really undemanding mood where you won't think too hard during your viewing.","

"Escape Room","educallejero","16 February 2019","I absolutely despised this.They SPOIL THE MOVIE ON THE FIRST SCENE (amazing first scene, by the way).WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?Another thing: Usually, the characters trapped are a bit more complex than these guys. They usually start as archetypes: the egotistical douche; the innocent teen; the maternal/paternal figure; the fat/dumb guy; the hot chick. But when we get to know them, we realize that everybody has done bad things, and even the bad guys usually have good qualities.Whatever, that's what is usually done. Not this movie. This movie is nothing. The archetypes are only archetypes, backstory or not. The ""who's doing this"" has been done a gazillion times before, and probably every single time, better than here.And one thing is to be predictable, a lot of movies are in some way or another. Another thing is to be predicable, and play it like they are being new and different while also giving CLEAR EVIDENCE OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, with the already named FIRST FREAKING SCENE!Whatever. This is atrocious. Also, about that Disney thing. You have traps. You don't need to go to the extreme Jigsaw graphic violence. No need for that.

Three of them in fact were simply called Escape Room.This 2019 outing is the highest budget of the four and the third that I've seen. I've always said that budget doesn't matter provided you don't swing above your weight but here it's helped no end.Both of the previous two were watchable stuff but this right here is very impressive and positively franchise worthy.It tells the story of six people invited to participate in an escape room for a 10,000 dollar prize. All starts innocently enough until things start getting a little too real.Starring the excellent Tyler ""Tucker & Dale"" Labine and Deborah ""True Blood"" Ann Woll I was impressed with the competent cast, the stunning visuals, genuine intellect and originality (Despite all the others of the same ilk recently).By the time the credits rolled my belief that this should be a franchise had strengthened. This, could be something really special. I'm not saying they should milk it like they did with SAW (2004) but at least a trilogy could be very rewarding.Fantastic movie, more please!The Good:Some great ideasVisually impressiveSolid castRipe for a franchiseThe Bad:Couple of flawed moments","

At one point, surprised myself by leaning over to him and admitted I couldn't believe how much I was enjoying it! Good story with a lot of suspense. I was genuinely into it, not wandering in thought at all throughout. I am not familiar with any of the actors, but they were all very good and believable. I loved all the detail put into each of the scenarios through the different rooms. An action-terror fantasy as I'm pretty sure actual escape rooms don't work like this. Kind of got lost at the end, we still can't come to a conclusion as to how all the rooms went away that quickly (the whole building, for that matter?), and after the airplane scene are we left to believe that all of life is just one big search for the clues to escape?? Probably a bit too esoteric for us. May be a sequel lead-in ending? ? I can't pretend to know, but I still recommend.

This movie has several influences, including Cube and Saw. Six strangers are given an invitation to come play a game and their incentive is a chance to win $10,000.00. Taylor, Logan, Deborah and Tyler are four of the six participants-they don't all survive. The only thing they are told is that if they solve the puzzles, they can win the money. Once the game starts, they realize that they are in deadly danger-most of them just thought they would be able to go home, if they failed a test. Each room they escape from just leads into another death trap. Whoever is behind the games knows personal background information-dark secrets-on each contestant. You do discover exactly what is going on and why, by the end of the movie and there is an ending set up for a sequel.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for terror/perilous action, violence, suggestive material and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.

"Escape Room","Coventry","1 September 2021","When I hear or read the words ""Escape Room"", I automatically think about those horrible - and sadly mandatory - team building activities I had to participate in the past couple of years. Escape Rooms are undoubtedly one of the most annoying and useless hypes of the 2010's. Few things in life are more irritating than having to solve stupid puzzles with people you can barely stand, only to discover that the answer to the puzzle leads you towards a new and even bigger puzzle. Giving the concept of the game, it obviously was just a matter of time before an Escape Room would get used as a location or as a gimmick in a horror film. It's a concealed space full of potential torturing devices; so basically, just a blending between ""Cube"" and ""Saw"". Between 2017-2019, at least three or four uninspired horror movies centering around escape rooms were released. They don't even bother to come up with a decent title and are all called ""Escape Room"".Until now, I had only seen a 2017-version written and directed by Will Wernick. It was awful, and I'll gladly admit this 2019 film (by Adam Robitel) is a massive improvement. This particular ""Escape Room"" has the best rating, the most favorable reviews and already turned out successful enough to have spawned a sequel. The stories of all ""Escape Room"" films are identical, obviously, but there are at least some likable characters in this one, and the writers undertook some effort to give them a bit of intellect, emotional depth and background. The deaths aren't excessively gruesome or bloody, but still painful enough for me to want and subscribe some colleagues I cannot stand. It's still predictable nonsense, though, as it takes far too long before the players realize their little game is deadly serious, and the ""twist"" at the end is blatantly stolen from a certain Eli Roth film released in 2005.","

"Escape Room","classicsoncall","10 August 2020","Tell you what, I'm almost seventy years old and I never heard of an escape room. I just did an internet search and found out that this sort of immersive group game actually exists. The thing is, what responsible business or entertainment company makes it their business model to kill their customers? Granted, the invitations to the six participants in this particular escape room didn't involve pay for play, but still. It takes a certain demented mind to get off on the torture and death of others. So with unlimited resources, I guess some major reprobates could pull something like this off.Going in I couldn't really tell in which direction this story would go specifically, but pretty much knew from the start that Zoey (Taylor Russell) would be a survivor. Even when she 'died' I figured there would be some room in the script to make it negotiable. I didn't see two survivors coming out of the game, so that was a bit of a twist. The various room scenarios were pretty creative, although the winter scene with the snow and ice cast all probability out of the picture for me.The ending of the story sets up the opportunity for a sequel in which Zoey and Ben (Logan Miller) try to get the goods on the Games Master and Puzzle Maker. I'd probably tune in to see how that one turns out, but I'm not holding my breath.","

"Escape Room","BA_Harrison","21 February 2022","Six people are invited to take part in an 'escape room', in which players must find and solve a series of clues that will lead to their freedom, the winner of the game receiving $10k for their troubles. Of course, this being a horror movie, failing to correctly solve the puzzles within the allotted time leads to death.Escape Room requires its characters to behave in a very specific way for it to work: what if one of the players didn't turn up at the start? What if all of the contestants failed to solve the first room and died immediately? What if a player with a specific skill died before they arrived at the room which was designed to make use of their particular ability? Any deviation from the creators' predicted sequence of events and it would be game over (and movie over). It's asking a lot of the viewer to ignore this fact.If you can successfully put those kinds of thoughts out of your mind for the duration, then the film is an enjoyable enough time waster, delivering plenty of tension, but little of the gore to be found in the films it most closely resembles: the Saw series. People die, but we don't get to see them reduced to bloody chunks. The fun is more in seeing how the contestants can solve the puzzles than in how messily they are killed.Director Adam Robitel handles the material confidently enough and his cast of relative unknowns all acquit themselves well, making this a slick but narratively flawed little thriller for those who find the Saw movies a little too extreme for their taste.","

"Escape Room","view_and_review","10 October 2019","Moving on from my defense of escape rooms, this movie is nothing unique in the least. This movie has been done several times before in different forms, but now they've titled it ""Escape Room"" to be contemporary and capitalize on a contemporary form of recreation. This movie is essentially a modern version of Cube--the idea of having to solve puzzles to exit a room of death.Then there are the movies Saw, Die, Hunger, Hostel, Would You Rather, The Belko Experiment, Kill Theory, 13 Sins, and others which are all predecessors to this in one form or another.This movie and the others I mentioned are fun, but I have a major problem with one part of the story lines. I hate the Illuminati aspect of these types of movies. It's so tired to conjure up an individual or group of individuals that are so powerful that they can concoct these expensive elaborate death traps for simple entertainment. And even more than the wanton spending on people and equipment just to kill is the divine ability to know intimate details of a person's life so as to recreate horrible situations they were in. I wouldn't care how much money you have there are certain things that are just unknowable unless you are God Almighty. Now, if they go for a paranormal angle then I can understand, but to believe a team of clandestine people can gather mountains of intimate details on people, recreate said details, then lure those people into the detailed trap--it's too far-fetched.Again, Escape Room is fun, but so were all of the other movies before it. I give it an eight on the fun scale and a zero on the originality scale.","

"Escape Room","opmoffatt","2 October 2022","Seems like a blatant rip-off of Saw, and it's filled with plotholes. Some of the characters are insufferable and terribly written and it is filled with pointless one-liners that force me to cringe throughout the movie. Some of the lines made me laugh out loud. The concept of the escape rooms, however, is a very cool idea and with better execution, it could've been great. The designs for the rooms were also cool but it felt *too* similar to saw. I also found it too predictable and the ending seemed forced and also a bit anticlimactic. 3/10, it gets 3 points for its semi0creativity with the escape rooms.","

"Escape Room","deloudelouvain","11 April 2019","If you're just looking for easy entertainment then you can't go wrong with Escape Room as there are never dull moments and there is that constant feeling that something bad is going to happen. Maybe it's a bit over the top but that's the style of this kind of movies, and it might be predictable at times but the general idea is working, the audience is entertained. The acting wasn't bad concidering the genre of movie, nothing mindblowing either but good enough to not be annoyed. Some reviewers compare it to Saw, which is partialy true but Saw is just a bit sicker with more gory moments.","

"Escape Room","ThomasDrufke","8 January 2019","It's the first officially released film of the year, so my expectations are about as low as they could possibly be. January has and probably always will be the dumping ground for movie releases (although September has tried to take those reigns in recent years), but Escape Room manages to be a semi-entertaining if not overtly silly mystery thriller. In many ways, the film is almost too clever for its own good. Constantly proposing new and fascinating ideas amidst a cool action scene, only to be outdone by clumsy dialogue and below average acting. But make no mistake, for an early January release, this was a solid amount of fun.6.0/10","

Neither of us seen a trailer of any kind and went into it blindly. I'm glad I did, because seeing a film you know nothing about and being high was an awesome experience.The film centers around a group of people having to get out of a series of rooms for a mere $10,000 dollars. When they find out how dangerous it is, I would be asking for a raise for all this crap. However, it's all very inventive and the scenes were pretty tense. I was at the edge of my seat.... of course I was high.However, the movie starts to derail towards the end and I predicted the ending and wished they didn't go that route. There are also some scenes where the dialogue between characters felt unnecessary. There's a fight between two characters that could have waited until they got out of there.However, I'm glad I saw it. The only way I could remember this movie is the fact it was the first movie of 2019 that I saw. It reminded me a lot of Saw, and I was entertained which was what I was asking for.","

"Escape Room","sbweightman","26 January 2019","An extreme version of the popular group event, which although lacking originality and has a weak ending, is entertaining to watch throughout. The story is simple and unoriginal, but the setting starts off strong with some great puzzle rooms and tension. However, as the film becomes formulaic, it loses this edge and has to rely on the settings and passable special effects to keep momentum. The characters are good and well rounded, each with their distinct personalities and back stories, but the mystery behind the game is very disappointing, and the ending is poor and goes on for far too long.","

This is the premise of the movie, however, there is not much gore and some focus on the puzzles. They do try to make the characters more likable, and it did make an impact. However, if they added more of the mathematical aspects like Cube, and made the characters spend more time deducing, it would have been better. The solutions seem to be found too conveniently by chance. Yet, it delivers great entertainment, and has a not subtle set up for a sequel; which is both thrilling and cheap.

These characters have to be the worst in a movie so far this year, you're just hoping to see them die because they're complete a**holes but even when it happens is uninteresting because this movie is for babys.
One of the worst things is that there is very noticeable dubbing in the entire film, and i'm talking about The Room quality dubbing, I guess the dialogue was even worse or the acting was even more atrocious and they decided to dub every line.
The movie itself doensn't make any sense and the pacing is so slow, this garbage is like 100 minutes but it feels like is a 4 hours movie.
Just go on Youtube and watch the trip scene, I was laughting so hard that my neighbors knocked att my door complaining, and I have a big house so you can imagine how funny that stupid scene is.

"Escape Room","paul-allaer","5 January 2019","""Escape Room"" (2019 release; 100 min.) opens with a bang: a guy seemingly drops from out of the ceiling into a room, whose walls are rapidly closing in on him. Will he manage to escape the room? We then go back to ""Chicago, Three Days Earlier"", as we get to know several people, including Zoey, a shy college student taking a quantum physics class. The professor encourages Zoey to do something outside of her comfort zone over the Thanksgiving break. He then sends her a mysterious black box, which Zoey finally manages to open. It contains an invitation to participate in an escape room contest. Five other people have received the same invitation (we learn much later what the connection between those 6 people is), and they convene in a third floor office waiting room... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Adam Robitel, who just last year brought us ""Insidious: The Last Key"". Here the movie makers have what sounds like a possibly intriguing premise: put a group in a room which seemingly has no way out, but of course there is if you find the right clues. In the film, the group will go through 5 rooms altogether, and each of the escape rooms has a particular theme to it. So far, so good. Alas, that is it for the good stuff. Now the not-so-good: there is no character development to speak of, with Zoey being the one minor exception. As a result, I have zero emotional involvement in any of them (with the exception of Zoey, however minor). Worse, there are no scary moments to speak of, in fact none. As a result, we merely watch what happens on the screen, but not in a scared way at all. Last but certainly not least: where is all the fun? I wasn't having any fun watching this, and it appears neither do any of the 6 lead performers making this movie. I can't help but recall ""Happy Death Day"" of a few years ago (whose sequel was one of the trailers shown in the previews, by the way). which also had an interesting premise (""Groundhog Day"" for scary movies), but which brought it with smarts, with some fun and definitely some scary moments. Too bad ""Escape Room"" couldn't be more like that. I wish I could be more positive about ""Escape Room"", but the truth is I felt very disappointed.""Escape Room"" opened wide this weekend. The Saturday screening where I saw this at in a large theater was attended okay, but just okay (about 25 people). If you are into scary movies, keep your expectations low, and maybe this will work out fine for you. Of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","

Yet, the puzzles somewhat intrigue and the fact that it's a race against time makes it fairly exciting (though repetitive). The upside-down pub was the best (and most inventive) of the lot. The climax is again, a total downer. At a crisp run-time of 95 minutes, the film doesn't let you think too much because it's custom-made for twists and last-second flourishes. Performances are serviceable, but it did look like the cast was 'trying hard'. As was the case with the latter Saw flicks (a little too much déjà vu), the dialogues are mostly banal. Watch it purely as a guilty pleasure!","

The basic premise is fairly simple, a group of six strangers receive, under mysterious circumstances, a sort of puzzle cube which when unlocked reveals instructions for an ""escape room"" experience where the winner wins 10,000 dollars. Some decide to participate due to barely being able to get by on their work salary while others are wealthy and successful and seem interested in the ""Escape Room"" only for pure amusement purposes or perhaps to challenge themselves mentally.Regardless of why they decide to join, once they arrive and the ""Escape Room"" begins it quickly becomes clear that this is no simple harmless game, the stakes are deadly and the consequences are real, and if they can't find a way to escape it very well may mean the end of not the game, but their very lives!","

"Escape Room","jtindahouse","21 February 2019","I remember seeing 'Cube' when I was a kid and being fascinated by the concept. 'Escape Room' is basically 'Cube' on heat. What surprised me most was how creative it managed to be (and I expected a creative movie going in). Some of the rooms created in this film were next level, both in their look and function. Moving from room to room kept the pacing at a very fast level as well. Add in highly watchable characters, an original concept and some clever plot twists and you have yourself a very fine film.What excites me about 'Escape Room' is the unlimited potential for sequels. There is an incredible amount you could do with this concept. If they played it right they could have countless sequels and have each one of them feeling equally fresh. While I did like the characters in this one, I don't necessarily see them needing to be the same in the next one either. They could go the 'Final Destination' route and have a different cast each film (with perhaps the odd reoccurring character).There wasn't a lot I didn't like about the film. Perhaps one of the rooms (the ice room) dragged a little too long and the ending, while I appreciated its endeavour, didn't quite deliver the knock-out blow I would have liked to nudge this up to a 9/10. Still though, the large majority of the film is a great viewing experience no doubt about it. If you're on the fence about this film, get out and see it. You'll be glad you did.","

"Escape Room","BJG-Reviews","9 May 2023","The stage curtains open ...Danny: ""Talk about immersive!""
Amanda: ""Immersive? What the hell is wrong with you? That was real!""""Escape Room"" (2019) starring Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, and Deborah Ann Woll is a thrill ride from start to finish with everything you would expect from a movie with this title. I'm gonna be honest here. Some of the reviews I've read, by critics and moviegoers alike, have been less than flattering - stating things like 'this movie fails to deliver on its full potential'. Seriously? I'm not sure what else they were expecting to see. Did they want a YA version of ""Saw""? Not enough blood and guts for ya? LOL - THIS was a fun movie and much better than what the so-called experts have billed it to be.Six very unique individuals with strong personalities have been invited to participate in a game of strategy that requires them all to work together in what is called an Escape Room - or they won't win. As the first room begins their game, they soon find out it is much more than a game. It is very real with very deadly consequences if you can't solve the puzzle in unlocking the way out. It isn't long before they begin second-guessing each other, wondering if someone among them is the orchestrator of their collective demise. As the survivors progress through this deadly maze, they come realize that they are there for a specific purpose, one they could never have guessed.I read some of the reviews for this before I watched it ... the good and the bad. I didn't have very high expectations going in, and maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much. I don't understand the negativity surrounding this film. I felt each room was original in its design, and the plot behind it all was interesting and engaging. It was decently acted with some great action sequences and thrills. I liked each of the characters as well, as they all brought something to the table worth having. Some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy in parts, I will say that much, but overall, this movie delivers.I highly recommend ""Escape Room"" at a solid 8 stars out of 10. Like any movie of this kind, you are going to find loopholes and inconsistencies, but those aside, you are left with a fun ride for 99 minutes. I've seen this movie twice now - the 2nd time because I wanted to freshen up on it before I watched the sequel (which I am about to do right now). If you aren't an extremely picky person and you enjoy a good thriller, this is right up your alley.","

We have the standard set up: six people make their way to the Escape Room venue, some having to solve puzzles to get their invites. While the progress of the film could be predicted, the game/room scenarios are innovative, perhaps an improvement in style rather than substance. Some rather cruel, indeed nasty deaths involving characters you may have bonded with. The reason why this particular group have been invited to participate in the game is an interesting if not original reveal, it comes after a few red herrings have been set loose.Good acting from Taylor Russell as an introverted student, Deborah Ann Wool as a traumatised ex-marine and Logan Miller as an underachieving slacker.

"Escape Room","baileycrawly","10 January 2021","Nobody really puts on a horror movie with the expectation that they're going to see the latest and greatest in cinematic achievements, and this movie is no different. Nobody is putting this movie on expecting Kubrickian levels of detail and storytelling. It's just a fun little thriller and, when you view it through that lens, it's a really successful movie.
The escape rooms are all pretty well done, and the way the characters (though bland and recycled hundreds if not thousands of times in hundreds if not thousands of other movies) played off each other really well. Despite being generic, there was just enough of a charm to them that, when you watch the scenario play out, you can still feel for them. When one of them does something stupid that affects another one (spoilers redacted, of course), you can feel their remorse for the situation. When the time comes for the size of the group to begin diminishing, the characters were done well enough that you're almost sad to see them go, as each subtraction changes the dynamic of the remaining members to a certain degree.
It was a very tense film and, although it took a little bit too long to get going and let me down a little bit with the ending, it was still a really solid and enjoyable film. Given the length of the film, the amount of material they covered and the fact that they needed to end with SOMETHING, I'd say they did pretty good.","

I personally have a hard time getting behind movies where the plot revolves around the ultra-rich picking the ""most special"" among st us, lowly, poor, flawed people to put in some ""survive or be tortured"" scenario. The more elaborate the rich person's scheme, the less interested I find it. So, this movie definitely was in for an uphill battle with me.

"Escape Room","RforFilm","7 January 2019","If there's one rule that Hollywood likes to follow, it's that if something is hip and current, then it's bound to get a horror movie. In today's case, its about escape rooms. I haven't done an escape room, even through I like the concept; your with a group, locked in a room (or rooms in some cases) and you need to solves riddles, clues, and puzzles in order to get out before the time runs out. Not only does it almost make a real life video game, but it's a genius way to play up suspense where there is none.The only way one could get genuinely frightened is if the people running the rooms were good enough actors. Escape rooms are another way of illusion, and the trick will only work if they can suspend disbelief that their only playing a game. It's the same idea with video games; even if your rescuing a princess from Super Mario Bros., your really only playing programing on a computer. So the idea of taking an escape room and making it a life or death situation isn't a bad idea. So let's see if Escape Room can develop potential like a cross of The Game and Saw.In Chicago; we focus on several individuals who all receive puzzle boxes. We have college student Zoey (played by Taylor Russell), a slacker Ben (played by Logan Miller), and a successful business trader Jason (played by Jason Walker). They all solve it and receive invitations to a nearby escape room where it's also revealed that if they solve it, they'll receive $10,000. They arrive, along with former solider Amanda (played by Deborah Ann Woll), former miner Mike (Played by Tyler Labine) and escape room expert Danny (played by Nik Dodani). They all head for a waiting area for the game to start...or so they think.When one tries to leave, only for the handle to come off with a set of numbers appearing, they realize that the game has already started. Things become dangerous when the room starts to heat up like an oven. When they manage to get out, they find the next room and several others to be just as perilous. In fact, they see some of their fellow players die. The race is on to see if they can solve the clues, find out who is behind this, and why they were chosen to partake in a most dangerous game.I've said before that I think Escape Room could potentially be a good idea and I even like the angle their taking here. The problem is that the movie is dull and uninspired. Escape Room is another throwaway January release that might play better on streaming platforms, but has little reason for a theatrical release. The first problem is the characters. None of them are memorable or likable enough for care about whether they meet their death solving a puzzle or not. It's hard to tell if they needed better actors or a better script, but I'm betting on the latter, as it has to do with my other problem.The plot is fine, with the goal of simply getting out. It's the overall setup that really fails, and it's worse as I see what they were trying to do. The rooms are supposed to be themed out of a traumatizing past that each character went through. But it only touches upon their past personalities without much rhyme or reason. A character went through a drunk driving history; so let them solves a riddle and their magically cured. One man killed another in his past; so he'll take a drug and confront it. You can tell the script was rushed in favor of focusing on the thrills.I'll give this four escape room passes out of ten. I give it some credit for it's room design and idea in general. But it's too half-assed and non caring on it's characters for me to recommend. At best, if your looking for some thrills within a puzzle room, you'll get some. But for most, I'd say skip this escape room and go to a spa instead.","

"Escape Room","Firetears_X","4 January 2019","Let's be honest: no one is watching this movie with crazy expectations. If you're expecting a decent thriller under the condition that you suspend all belief, that's exactly what you're going to get with this movie. It's nothing amazing here but it did have potential to get a full 7 stars had it not been for a lazy plot twist involving the character Jason.All of the characters throughout the movie are revealed to have been sole survivors in freak accidents that killed everyone else involved. Jason, for example, was lost in the middle of the ocean with his roommate. It is revealed in the third act that Jason killed his roommate so that he could have a better chance of surviving. Revealing Jason to be a psychopath works well as a plot twist out of context but in the context of the movie it was lazily done.Jason wasn't shown the be the greatest guy of the bunch. In fact, he quickly shrugged off a couple deaths before the villainous reveal but he also had moments of consideration. It's assumed that he killed his roommate so that he wouldn't have to share a winter jacket under freezing conditions but during the game he had no qualms with sharing the winter jacket. There was also a room where the movie's lead, Zoey, nearly died had she not been saved by Jason who risked his life for her. I guess the hints to his true character was his ability to shake off the deaths of complete strangers.And while I'm on the discussion of complete strangers, you have to love a movie that spells out just how dispensable their characters are. The movie starts with introductions to Zoey, Jason, and Ben living their everyday lives before entering the escape room. Then, once they go into the escape room, the movie introduces three other characters who come from nowhere. You know right away that those three are going to die for sure just based on the fact that they appeared from thin air.During the beginning of the third act, Zoey decides to fight back by destroying all of the cameras in a room that's designed to poison the players. I loved that the lead decided to fight back instead of playing but, again, the execution was lazily done and absolutely depended on belief suspension. Zoey, under the effects of poison gas, faints to the ground, foaming at the mouth while she does so. A few scenes later, it's revealed that she used an oxygen mask from the ceiling to survive the gas attack. However, that scenario alone comes with many questions. Why would the game master even bother putting an oxygen mask in the room if he wants all of the players to die? And am I expected to believe that Zoey got back up after *nearly (I suppose)* choking to death?And then there's also that big brother element that lacks any realism. Everything in the building that supported the impossible escape rooms disappeared in the matter of a few hours. If I was foolish enough to believe that an enormous crew could dismantle six escape rooms in a few hours then it still wouldn't explain the willingness for everyone involved. It relies on Purge logic in that there are millions of people who are into observing and creating violence.All of that said, it ended on a great note where Zoey is trying to hunt down the game master. It actually has me very interested in a sequel; assuming we get to see more of Zoey being a vengeful badass.","

"Escape Room","bastos","3 February 2021","Dear Mr. Filmmakers, please stop starting your movies with scenes from the end to have an exciting beginning and build suspense. It doesn't work and it's been done to death to the point that now it only spoils part of your movie. Thank you. After this small rant let's talk about the movie. Escape Room borrows many of its concepts from other movies, but that's not necessarily a bad thing because there aren't that many high concept movies like this, and, for me, they usually work. It is an intriguing idea and makes for an entertaining ride, with some good escape room concepts and many suspenseful moments, which never make the movie boring. The characters are a bit flat and the acting isn't Oscar worthy, but that's not very important here. Another odd choice, following the horrendous spoiler opening, is the decision of only giving background on three of the characters. I would've much preferred if they had started the movie with them already in the escape room or, if you need to pad your runtime, at least give background on all of the characters or otherwise you can more or less guess who's dying first. Which brings us to the elephant in the room which is the ending (light spoilers ahead). The problem with these kind of movies is that it's very hard for the writers to come up with a satisfying ending, you either explain everything and leave many viewers disappointed because you can't deliver on the intriguing concept or you don't explain anything, leaving it to the viewer's imagination with many people complaining that it's an easy cop out. It's a bit damned if you do and damned if you don't, what I call the J.J. Abrams conundrum. This one tries the third route with a totally over the top and unbelievable ending, which is so insane that they hope people won't even stop to think how absurd everything was, while at the same time setting up a sequel, again a sin most people don't like. All in all I had fun with the movie with the exception of the beginning and ending and can recommend the movie for what it is.","

"Escape Room","kosmasp","7 June 2019","Or Cube meets Saw - sort of. I have not been to an Escape Room yet, but I do hope they are not like this ... the movie sets the mood from the start though! We get to see what the people who get involved in this have to face. And let me tell you: it is grim and it is violent! So not for the faint of hearted as you should be able to tell.It is tough to comment on acting, because this puts its characters in extreme situations (literally) and that is where it draws its drama from. If that sounds like something you like to see and experience (in movie form that is, completely seperated from reality), then the movie is something for you to watch. And everyone involved does a great job. Effects are good and even though we have to have token bad and good people, the chemistry also works overall","

"Escape Room","jboothmillard","4 November 2019","These days, everyone is trying an escape room, so it is very appropriate to have a scary movie about one, I was told this was a pretty decent film, directed by Adam Robitel (Insidious: The Last Key). Basically, six strangers with varied backgrounds are sent a puzzle cube, each solve it, and are invited by the Minos Corporation to take part in an escape room with a $10,000 prize. These six people are physics student Zoey Davis (Taylor Russell), wealthy daytrader Jason Walker (Jay Ellis), grocery store stock boy Ben Miller (Logan Miller), truck driver Mike Nolan (Tyler Labine), Iraq War veteran Amanda Harper (True Blood's Deborah Ann Woll), and gamer and escape room enthusiast Danny Khan (Nik Dodani). The participants arrive at an office block and gather in the waiting room, waiting for the Gamemaster to arrive, but nobody comes. Ben tries to leave, but the door handle falls off, revealing that the challenge has begun. The room turns out to be a giant oven that begins to heat up. The players discover how to unlock an escape passage, using weight activated table coasters, and climb out before the room is filled with fire. Danny is convinced that it is still a game, and there is no foul play. Next the group find themselves in a winter cabin, where Ben deduces how to open the door. They step out into a room that appears to be an icy wilderness, with a small wood and a large lake, one jacket to keep them warm, and the temperature is dropping. Trying to find the key or a way out, Danny falls through the ice and drowns. They find the key, which is trapped in a block of ice, they use their body temperature to melt it down. Some players notice reminders of their traumatic events of the past. The remaining five players enter an upside-down billiards bar, where parts of the floor periodically fall into a deep shaft below. They realise the room contains a giant sliding puzzle, and the missing 8 ball is the key. Amanda retrieves the ball and throws it to Jason before plummeting to her death. The next room is a hospital ward with six beds, each representing a player. It is revealed that all of the six players were each sole survivors of various disasters: Ben survived a car crash, Jason escaped a shipwreck, Mike escaped a collapsed mine, Zoey survived a plane crash, Danny survived when his family died of carbon monoxide poisoning, and Amanda survived an IED blast. Zoey deduces that the purpose of the game is to determine which player is the luckiest of all. Jason discovers that the room is about to be filled with poisonous gas. Zoey refuses to continue playing and instead destroys the room's surveillance cameras. It is suggested that someone needs to record a certain heart rate for the players to escape. Mike has the highest heart rate, but not high enough to work. Jason suggests using the defibrillator on an unwilling Mike, Jason manipulates him by mentioning the mining tragedy. Jason accidentally kills Mike with a shock. He then solves the puzzle when the gas is released. Jason and Ben escape, but Zoey refuses to follow and disappears into the gas. Jason and Ben enter a room with optical illusions and strobe lights. While drugged with a hallucinogen, they fight over an antidote. Ben kills Jason and injects himself with the antidote. He then falls into the last room, where a wall moves inwards to crush him. Meanwhile, in the hospital room, the escape room employees enter to dispose of the dead bodies. Zoey jumps up and attacks them. Ben solves the last room and meets The Gamemaster, WooTan Yu (Yorick van Wageningen), who controls the game that the Puzzle Maker designed. The Gamemaster explains that each year they lure in players with something in common, and wealthy viewers bet on the result. The Gamemaster tries to kill Ben, but Zoey intervenes, and together they kill The Gamemaster. As Ben recovers, Zoey returns to the building with a detective. The police do not believe Zoey, as all evidence of the game has disappeared. Ben is not believed either, as drugs are detected in his system. While looking at the graffiti on the wall, Zoey notices the words ""No Way Out"", an anagram for ""Wootan Yu"", suggesting the game is not over. Six months later, Zoey meets up with Ben. Newspapers have passed off the other players' deaths as accidents. Ben suggests they should move on, but Zoey refuses to do so. Ben agrees to join Zoey as they travel to Manhattan to follow clues that point to an unlisted building. However, the mysterious Puzzle Maker is already preparing to make their flight a new deadly game of survival. Also starring Kenneth Fok as Detective Li. Russell, Miller and the others give strong performances, a familiar day experience for families and friends is twisted into a dark and twisted mystery, the pace of this film almost never slows down, it is definitely the elaborate rooms that create the most excitement, especially the upside down room, a satisfactory enough horror thriller. Worth watching!","

"Escape Room","CANpatbuck3664","18 January 2019","Escape Room is another feature that is trying to start a franchise by keeping the budget down, so it doesn't have to gross a ton to break the bank (or to get the approval for the sequel). Normally, this might be considered a negative, but I think the creative team did an excellent job with the set design and the visual work for the traps. Each of them is frightening or pushes the envelope and the work done on them was good enough that I wasn't constantly questioning the logistics or how certain facets of the traps were plausible or implausible. They look great for a movie with a smaller budget and it was a pleasant surprise.The escape rooms not only looked great, but I also really enjoyed the design of the traps and how the puzzle pieces fit together on how to solve them. It showed some imagination from the screenwriter, director and puzzle designer and the unpredictability sold the danger in each environment. The scarier elements of each room really show off how much potential this premise has (if you can forgive the fact it has similarities to Saw and Cabin in the Woods). Some levels in the game are stronger than others (my least favourite was the ice room) but I also liked how the solutions to the problems incorporated teamwork and outside the box thinking. Again, there's a surprising amount of inspired work in Escape Room and I appreciated that effort instead of just phoning it in.While there's some interesting elements to the problems and environments our characters face, I wish the same detail had been applied to the script. The main group (comprised of 6-7 people) are all distinctive but they can't escape cliché when it comes to their personalities. We have the nerd, the pretty boy jerk, the social outcast etc. and I had hoped they would transcend such simple descriptions. As we find out more about them, you can understand how they're all bitter and why they don't want to trust each other but I think they could have worked a little harder on creating more unique characters. This is made worse by the dialogue being a little stilted. Almost all the jokes in this fall flat and it makes it harder to bond and root for our heroes (or villains depending on which character you're talking about).Escape Room follows in the foot steps of other horror franchises like Saw and Final Destination in its premise, the plot progression and ultimately the actors and actresses they cast. I've already mentioned that Escape Room looks great on a modest budget, but it also follows the proud tradition of hiring so-so actors to fill out the cast. I thought there was 1 clear standout performance and it came from Deborah Ann Woll as Amanda Harper. The participants/players in Escape Room are neither pure victims or virtuous heroes but Deborah shone through and brought the most emotion to her arc as Amanda. I kept hoping she was going to get more screen time and she did the best she could with what could have been a very forgettable character. Tyler Labine was the next best, he's a good character actor and while they desperately needed to punch up his dialogue, he still managed to get a couple of genuine laughs out of me and he had a few effective dramatic moments. I think the rest of the main cast (Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Jay Ellis and Nik Dodani) were okay but they played a little too far into type. For example, Taylor is a little too reserved, Jay is too mean without any provocation and Nik Dodani is forced to keep playing the same note in his acting repertoire. They aren't helped by the dialogue and character development, but they all get the job done.Escape Room benefits mostly from a great premise and low expectations. My best friend recommended this to me, and his recommendation carries weight. That's what convinced me to go see it. The puzzle design, the interesting set pieces and the overall look of the movie carry it past some of the more implausible moments and while the acting is a mixed bag, the cast does what they can while the material and dialogue try to drag them down. The ending features a nice twist, but it risks pushing the movie into some goofy territory to setup a sequel. I would love to see a sequel to Escape Room, it would give them a chance to build off this debut feature and further shape the idea into a really good movie (e.g. how they took the original Purge movie and drastically expanded on the idea in the sequels). I would give Escape Room a 7.5/10 for delivering a better than expected horror thriller but I can't go all the way to 8/10 because of some of the bigger problems. I'll round down to a 7/10. Its worth checking out but if you can't catch it in the theatre, I think you could stream it at home and have a good time.","

"Escape Room","ahayesss","6 January 2019","Whenever a thriller is rated PG-13, I have doubts. However, the first minute of this film keeps you on the edge of your seat, where you stay unti the end. The intensity of the film caused my anxiety to go crazy! The plot also seemed like something that could have been a hit or miss. There have been many films similar to this one, but this one does a nice job of adding never before seen elements. I do have to say, once it got to the point with the final two characters (the drug sequence) it fell a little bit for me. I would still see the sequel though. Another thing that amazed me was the quality of the cinematography and editing. Visually captivating and disturbing. Lastly, I have to give credit to the cast. For not being very well known actors, they all managed to stay in character and portray the feelings of that chaotic experience. Definitely will be watching again!","

"Escape Room","GregTheStopSign95","21 November 2023","This movie is far better than it has any right to be, honestly. Except for the last, maybe 2 minutes? That could have been done a LOT better.A cast of relative unknowns join Deborah Ann Woll and Tyler Labine (frankly the only reasons I started watching this to begin with) for a Saw-style Escape Room movie in a shock twist, considering the title of the movie. I mean, who would have EVER thought that a movie called Escape Room would be about a series of Escape Rooms? Yeah, me neither.Anyway, for a movie that could very easily have been overly derivative and predictable as F, it really was surprisingly good. The tension was great, it distracted well from the relatively predictable story, and the relative unknowns - Nik Dodani, Taylor Russell, Jay Ellis, and Logan Miller - held their own pretty well alongside the more established Deborah Ann Woll and Tyler Labine. It's kind of a shame we didn't get to see more of them, but that would have been a very different movie, I guess.Long story short, you could do a LOT worse to fill your time than watching this.","

"Escape Room","Mivas_Greece","29 September 2021","Thriller / escape movie. Although many movies of this kind have been released with similar content, this one is definitely one of the best. Escape rooms well, but not just a simple game, rather a struggle for survival against time. Unsuspecting ""players"" must discover the puzzles of each room against time and before they get killed from its deadly traps. Unknown to each other players should cooperate fully, stay as cool as possible but most importantly, hurry because otherwise everyone will die. The movie has really clever puzzles, plenty of suspense from start to finish and twists. In addition to the excellent direction and convincing acting, another positive thing is the fact that it deepens in each character of the film, so that the viewers can better correlate with the players and their struggle for survival. In the end it leaves room for an equally good sequel. It is definitely recommended and it is watched again and again with same interest! A reference film in this concept!","

"Escape Room","afrocut","5 January 2019","Let's talk about the elephant in the room first , yes this has been done before and better. Playing off of established ideas from movies like Cube and Saw the film tries to set a path all it's own, and for the most part it does but ultimately it falls back on some of those movies styles and troupes,while the script starts to fall apart . The movie gets going once it enters its first escape room and it's pretty intense as it moves along from room to room . Amazing set designs and interesting ideas involving each characters backstories scattered throughout the puzzles really help this . The actors also really are well casted , except for the main jerk of the bunch who's acting and dialogue get old fast and the troupes of the rich jerk seem tired and a little bizarre at times. Another problem is the directing on some of the flashbacks which feel very fake and don't match the rest of the movie. The film also begins with a flashforward kind of ruining some of the twists. The biggest problem is the end , it doesnt end , its sequel bait ,something these films have to learn to do better . end on an interesting twist involving our characters , don't add scene after scene ... it really ruined the momentum. And also kind of ruins the film. But I will admit when it's good, it's pretty good . Because of that it's worth a look.","

The only two things I really liked about the movie was the design of the rooms and the pacing, so I was never really bored during the movie, but it had alot of other stuff that bothered me too much. The deaths of the characters was not that amusing. The dialogue was bad from time to time. The movie felt like PG-13. How did Zoe survive the poisonous gas? And when Zoe is fighting the Games Master, he runs away and just disappears. There is a good camera angle of the room where they are fighting, so we can see the whole room, and there is NOWHERE that he could possibly hide. Suddenly, he just appears and tackles Zoe. Where did he come from?!And then we have the ending... When Zoe is going with the police to the building where it all happened, they go to the first room, which is the room that was completely burned. She explains that things used to be in certain places before it burned, like the painting with the ventilation shaft behind it that they used to escape the room. The police says that there is no evidence of that, and that's it for the police, their work there is done... Wait, what? No questions were asked, they just gave up and had to leave the premises. Lmao... The movie ends with the chance of a sequel, and the ending was really unoriginal and bad in my opinion. I was hoping that the characters did not actually die. Like the guy that went through the ice, that maybe he got washed away safely. And the girl that fell to her death, that she landed on something soft etc. I was hoping that it was all leading up to a big twist, something that you did not expect, or like in the movie The Game (1997) that it was all fake.I'll give it a 5/10. It was watchable and had some excitement, but the ending was too bad. Would not watch it again.","

"Escape Room","Spanner-2","4 January 2019","This is a suspenseful puzzle film as a group of seemingly unrelated people try to escape the ""escape room"" (really more like a building) without being killed.. Has some seriously inventive traps (like ""Saw"" only with a PG-13 rating and a bit more smarts). A decent cast, some of which are more familiar than others, helps make it worthwhile viewing.","

It is what it is, Not really serious horror but more a funhouse horror with satisfying changes of environment for interesting screen aesthetic that keeps your attention. The set design was creative and great in my opinion. Character interactions that were entertaining enough to fill space. And genuinely suspenseful scenes where I enjoyed theorizing who was next. I've been a fan of the genre for a long time, so long that I have sub-genres for horror in my mind, and again this is a great example of successful ""Funhouse horror"". Easily one of the better horror films I've seen in a year or so.","

It makes the entire movie more fun as you watch the characters solve the puzzles as they try to stay alive. I also liked the fact that the six members of this party were not all kids, something that you certainly could have had in a PG13 suspense film. I thought all six of the characters were good, but I really enjoyed Deborah Ann Woll (Daredevil), who I thought added some gravitas to, again, a PG13 suspense film. It's a fun movie.","

"Escape Room","eelen-seth","8 February 2019","Escape Room isn't a horror-film, let's be very clear about that. It's a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.The film opens by introducing half of the strangers we're about to get locked up with. Zoey (Taylor Russell) is a timid, intelligent college student who's been through some kind of trauma in her past. Jason (Jay Ellis - Insecure) is a confident yet cocky stock broker with a fight-or-die attitude. Ben (Logan Miller - Love, Simon) doesn't really know what he wants to be when he grows up, so losing himself in alcohol and chainsmoking is kind of his thing, in the meantime he works in the backroom of a hardware store. All of these people receive a gift from what seems to be people they work or study with. Once they crack open the invitation box itself, it points them into the direction of the location where the rest of the story will take place.Once arrived, we meet our other three contestants. Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll - Daredevil) is an Iraq veteran, Mike (Tyler Labine) the truck driver and Danny (Nik Dodani - Atypical) our escape room enthusiast. Before truly realising it, the game has already begun, and it becomes very clear that this is gonna be a fight-for-survival kinda game. Real flames, real hypothermia, real heights to fall from and so on.. But the game has some secrets of its own, especially Zoey seems to notice little references to events in their lives.There isn't any blood-splashing or limb-cutting present, but there are enough other ways to keep the tension building all the way to the end. This partially has to do with the exquisite art direction. Every escape room has its own soul and environment that looks expensive: a room that turns into a human-sized oven, a cabin in a snowy landscape where every step might cause you to freeze to death, an upside down bar. Every escape room breathes atmosphere and the creators have spend attention to detail.The script gets a little bit funny at times because you know it all takes place in a building - or does it?! - but a little round of applause to writers Maria Melnik and Bragi Schut is definitely deserved. It never feels like these are just some set pieces and they all have to die at some point, because you actually don't know what might or might not happen to them. Some might be displeased with the final reveal, but for me it felt like the studio knew what they were going for and yes, building up for a sequel that might or might not get made in the future. I wouldn't mind that all. Let's say, BRING IT!Escape Room could've easily been some sort of twist to revive the Saw-franchise, but I'm happy it isn't. Tight, fun little thriller with some spectacular vertigo inducing set pieces.","

"Escape Room","saptesh786","16 April 2019","We suppose that the escape rooms are only physical that they are so far, but in this movie such rooms went into the game universe framework. So we can't understand what are we watching a escape room or a game? Such thing takes us in a big confusion zone i.e. what is actual and what is imagination of game? Some contestants had already died, then how they entered into escape room again and died again? Fake images of them? No answer or explanations found here. First at all escape room is going like a oven, then a cold icy area, then all rooms are reverse from bottom to at top and further situation going on endless. It seems that the only aim of escape room is to kill the participants anyhow, no matter of prize money! End is also unrealistic. How game designer know that the last survival are planning to board a plane to reach their headquarters? Here are many questions are unanswered. This movie only keeps you busy in erratic situation and use mind to survive yourself. No logic no explanation required here. Only watch with leaving brain at your home. Then you definitely enjoy this just stupid like movie. You must watch this if you are ready to watch without brain and none of question will be asked till the end. Then go it is for you. Actors and actresses are horrible, that not perfect as role demand. Then again I said leave acting aside only watch unstoppable crazy killing brain less drama. High ratings are wrong.","

They pulled those two together in a unique way and just made it a fantastic movie. I've seen reviews that it also has influences from the movie The Box, but I've never seen it so I can't vouch for that one. The actors were great and each room was so unique and puzzling. It seemed to go from one thing to the next in nonstop action, which is what I love in a movie like this. There was never a dull moment.The only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 was because of the ending, although I could see them setting it up for a second movie which I would be pleased to watch! I also wished they would have showed the other contestants receiving their boxes since they only showed the few and how they came across theirs. You can assume the ones they didn't show received them in a similar fashion, but it still leaves you wondering.Other than those two bits that could have been better, it still was an intense movie to watch and would recommend to anybody.","

"Escape Room","selfdestructo","16 March 2022","I really wanted to like this, the trailer made it look interesting. And, wow, did I hate it. From the very first scene, I could tell I was in for a long night. It portrays one guy in an escape room, fighting for his life, as the walls are literally closing in. Every action is narrated -- Like he would be spouting exposition in a life or death situation. What's worse, it is ADR-ed to death, so not a moment goes by without him yammering. This scene took me right out of the movie.Escape Room steals aspects of Saw, Cube, Cabin in the Woods, and Hostel, and slaps on the ""escape room"" motif. Major studio: Real PC, plus an amalgam of previous ideas repurposed. There's a horror movie trope that should have applied here: The black guy who ""takes command"" (yet was the absolute last person to realize they were IN the escape room), and barks orders at people throughout this running time, yeah, he should've been the first to go. Really, this is a whole group of annoying characters, bickering with each other constantly (I'll bring up the ADR additions again) -- People in the foreground will be arguing, and seemingly a dozen other voices will be in the background conflicting with each other. Definitely overkill on this aspect.I was so distracted by the character annoyances, that the puzzles and rooms took a back seat. I can tell you the ending where the police show up could not possibly have been more predictable (cliche, really), and of course the PC police strike gold with SPOILER the mousy black girl who rebels, gets all defiant and empowered, figures the entire thing out, and is one step ahead of the lunatics/geniuses who put the whole thing together. You go, girl!","

"Escape Room","janedoe5300","6 August 2021","My first impression of this film was that it was riddled with ridiculous elements. The characters are cliches, the dialogue is dumb, the acting is at best mediocre and the direction is horrible. I almost turned it off, but I'm glad I didn't. I would almost swear (if I didn't know how ridiculous the notion is) that they shot and edited this chronologically, and everyone needed about 10 scenes before the started to know what they were doing, because the film picks up at about 20 minutes in. Everything just seemed to get better, the dialogue, the acting, the characters. Or maybe, and more likely, the plot just took off, and I decided to ignore the dumb little things and just go with it. At about 35 minutes in I was thoroughly entertained. To be clear, this is not a brilliant movie. It's a thrilling semi horror flick, pretty clearly intended for teenagers, something of a retread of ideas from other YA films, and at 15 years old I would have absolutely loved the hell out of this film. At 31, I quite simply enjoyed myself.","

"Escape Room","rockman182","11 January 2019","Now that its a new year, its time for a new year in movies. January is often known as the month where bad movies are released. Escape Room sort of looked like it could fall into that category, but I had interest in this. This was particularly because I have done an escape room a few times (although I've never escaped). Having seen this film, I wish for everyone to ignore what critics say this was actually a solidly entertaining time. About the best possible scenario for a first week of January film.The film is about six different people who are invited to take part in an escape room, one that is billed as the best and toughest one out there. Soon the participants realize that their task isn't just a game and that its a game of survival with death being the consequence. They also soon realize that their selection to participate isn't as random as they initially anticipated. The film is directed by Adam Robitel, the same person responsible for Insidious: The Last Key, which I hated.The rooms and challenges are for the most part clever. Sure, some of the solving of the clues are fast and improbable but suspend that belief and enjoy. Its a really fun time especially for a film that operates with a PG-13 rating. Who would have thought that a film based on a popular social game could actually be really good? It has all the elements of what you would expect from a mystery-thriller so its a good time in the cinemas and a good start to 2019.The film does get messy towards the end, of course you can't really expect this thing to be perfect and without any faults. Also, I really disliked the way the film shamelessly tries to set up for a sequel when it would be better as a one and done, especially since it exceeded expectations. Overall, go see it and judge it for yourself because I feel like this is a picture that will get criticism before people attempt to experience it for themselves.7/10","

However, I was surprised at how well the main characters were written and that they were each given a backstory with compelling motivations and personalities. It wasn't completely perfect, at times Danny seemed like a bit of a charicature of a geek, but even then that wasn't overdone too much. And Mike wasn't given quite as much spotlight as the others, but the other 4 characters I thought were written and acted very well.I also enjoyed the creative puzzles and how they solved them, having done a few escape rooms before I could see the puzzles are similar to an actual escape room (although the stakes are a bit more extreme in this case!)Overall, I really enjoyed watching this and now I want to see the second one!","

I wanted to see if those would be resolved by watching the first.It is a typical take on a group of people trying to survive and escape these puzzle rooms and try not to die. You could argue similar movies are Saw and Follow Me.All characters seemed alright; I actually liked the different dynamic for all of them. Ben (who ends up surviving) was actually my least favorite which made the ending a little meh. Zoey gets kind of too attached to Amanda; I don't know why you'd be super devastated over some stranger you just met dying but okay.The twist with Zoey actually surviving was a bit predictable since the movie pushes for her to be the center character but the way she does is a bit questionable. I liked that they took time to figure these puzzles out (mostly Zoey did) and that the first ""solution"" wasn't always the right one.It's a decent watch but it's not something that you'd enjoy more than once.","

There was an escape room movie that isn't this one that I believe was just a low budget Netflix effort that was cashing in on escape rooms being the hot new thing, popping up in every city. This one absolutely blew the other one out of the water.Is it that believable? The answer is no. But they had the budget to really build some incredible scenes in each ""room"" and I was perfectly happy to turn a blind eye to believability because I felt the execution was phenomenal.The different rooms/challenges were really intense, really well thought through, and the actors all did a great job portraying individual characters that you can actually get behind and empathize with.The ending was a bit trash I thought, just a joyless attempt at leaving the door open for a sequel, but the rest was awesome.","

"Escape Room","DawnOfCreation","3 March 2019","The psychological games are well designed. The script is poorly executed. Acting is really really bad. Once they're inside the escape room the movies vibe stays exactly the same throughout the entire movie. No build-up tension. Nothing. So out of boredom I started to analyze the performances of the actors. They acted too dramatic imo and it just didn't seem real enough. For example: they're in this cold environment, but none of the actors were able to portray a realistic performance of a person who's suffering from hyperthermia. For me this was the moment I lost interest.Let's take 'Alita: Battle Angle' for example, despite being a somewhat shallow sci-fi flick this movie gave me an overall entertaining vibe. Escape Room simply does not! So I left the cinema dissatisfied..To sum it up: poorly executed script + bad acting = your typical cheap nonsensical Hollywood Garbage Movie.On a positive note: I loved seeing Deborah Ann Woll, she's a rare on-screen gem imo. She's the only reason I'll rate this movie 4 stars.*English isn't my native language","

"Escape Room","sauravjoshi85","2 April 2021","Escape Room is a psychological horror film directed by Adam Robitel and stars Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Deborah Ann Woll, Tyler Labine, Jay Ellis and Nik Dodani.To be honest i was absolutely disappointed by this movie and this movie is utterly disappointing and agonizing and apart from giving a hint of possible sequel the movie serves nothing purposeful in terms of horror or entertainment.The plot of the movie the movie revolves around the life of six people.who were invited for a game to escape from rooms in order to earn $10,000. To escape from the rooms it requires some sports which includes clues, the fun game soon turns into scare and shock as some of them starts loosing their life.The acting is weirdly bad and it seems that the acting is been done by some amateurs, Taylor Russell and Jay Ellis were the most annoying followed by Nik Dodani and Deborah Ann Woll. The screenplay is irritating and the constant fight among all six of them will make you more irritating, Climax of the movie doesn't excites and as mentioned earlier just gives a glimpse of another sequal in making.With gawky direction and dilettante acting this movie is nothing but a fine example of how to waste your precious 100 minutes. There will a section of viewers who will brag about praising this movie but well in that case i am happily on the another side, for me this is nothing but a crap of 100 minutes, please escape if you can.","

"Escape Room","mossow92","13 April 2019","I've always been enchanted by the idea of escape rooms. Always wanted to do one, just never had the chance. Ironically enough, this movie only enhanced my desire to do one. A very likeable and familiar cast serves their purpose through the twist and turns of a thriller that follows the now formulaic nature of the genre. Everyone gets a mysterious invite, enticed by money, and chaos ensues. Film flies by with a great mix of mystery, suspense, and action. An enjoyable time. Got to try one of these rooms soon.","

"Escape Room","SoumikBanerjee1996","11 October 2020","As a Concept, ""Escape Room"" doesn't yield anything new per se; but it bedazzles in its Execution! A competent thriller that is appealing, spirited & wholly entertaining!
All at the same time!I always look for captivating thrillers.
In this booming list of films; sometimes it gets difficult to find any. Luckily I bumped into 'Escape Room'.
The intellection albeit pretty similar to what SaW & Cube conferred way back at 2000's; what I absolutely admire is its approach for unfolding the same substance in disparate manner.
Puzzles are well structured, the visuals complimenting the same. Rendering distinctive ambience & tonalities with the help of versatile color palettes; the cinematography deserves a bucket load of praise.Story sets off on a breathless note and continues in similar fashion until it reaches its conclusion. Stakes being always high, it rarely loosen up on its steam. And that's truly commendable. The characters might have been deprived of germane backstories to support their individual personalities but on a relevance scale they did work absolutely fine.Performances are quite ordinary; but a sparkling chemistry shared between this group is something to take a note of.
I can't elaborate on the exact reason, but They all coagulated so well together.
Perhaps a great selection in casting paid off. The Soundscore had a rather contemporary influence; could be annoying to few. Personally I didn't mind much as I was too invested with the story and its persuasive progression.
My only indisposition is about the climax. Probably the solitary reason I didn't give it a higher rating! Gaping at how remarkably things were going up until the finale; my expectency had already gone up. Guess what? it let me down. Even though I distaste about how it ended; I understand their credulous intensions of setting themselves up for a probable sequel.And if that ever comes up; count me in!","

Uh what? And then im supposed to believe this company had the surveillance to know of the plan, and then the funding and time to build a giant plane trap simulator, and test run it with actors? And then what? They hijacked the plane these two are going to board and rig it to be an escape room? How does that make any sense","

Acting and direction were good, cinematography was nice, set design was well done, intricate puzzles and intriguing character backstories that help keep you interested; pretty immersive film.The last 10 minutes killed it a bit though, could of easily cut all of that out and the film would have ended on a fairly satisfactory note. They used the last 10 minutes to set up a sequel, but I just don't think it was necessary to be honest.Overall a pretty decent effort though, if you enjoy films like Saw and Cube then you should enjoy this one as well.","

"Escape Room","alimish-84346","13 April 2019","10/10 for someone, why? Did you sleep through half of the movie? I thought in escape rooms you are working together and share all the info, you shouldn't be keeping anything away. First room and all the weights... You could solve it in different ways. And all this ""let's try this"" when they know it could make the situation worse is weird. Staying sweat in -30-40° in shirt for so long and one of them even passed out but only till the doors open and he's ready to run. Escape room specialist for some reason drop under the ice and moving away - for some reason everybody start blaming guy who should loose on foot. How they decide what the game is about in each room is really strange how could you come up that lock asking for 2nd word of band which was playing when you crash car with your friends few ours years later all this by letters on trophies. All those cliffhangers were plain stupid and they're killing chars just to eliminate them for next room. Room with antidote - so if noone dies only two would have the poison magically get to you through skin. How come that the first guy didn't have symptoms till then 2nd guy touched it? Why not to use half of the antidote and share with 2nd guy? Good that the last room was so easy that grocery guy could solve it even he got the nomination for the game by throwing the black cube out the ground and mostly not came up with anything apart magically guess trophies. Ok in ""win"" room last guy was higher... But really you can lift up and strangle adult at least 75kg heavy adult fighting for life? Well he wasn't really human since ebony shot him twice and he teleported from only place he could hide with his large body and still be able to attack that girl. For some reason they had visible cams only in rooms and not in the rest of the complex. If you make a movie about solving puzzles you should avoid this mistakes and think it through. I'm not sure, that if I'm business man with own office and assistant I would be interested to spend my time to win $10k. Everything is times so if you like this ""stress out"" Scarry movies which don't really have deep meaning and you just want to discuss it with bunch of people and making fun of it - go for it. Don't expect much otherwise and really don't fall for those high rating review.","

Five other actors I've never heard of, what did I expect? To be fair Taylor Russell did well, this is the first time I have seen her. See was believable as the socially awkward quantum physics student, until the script decided she should yell ""breathe b!tch!!"" and she all of a sudden knows how to wield a handgun.The escape room fanatic character that has done 90+ escape rooms.. dies first. FFS. Come on.This movie had a lot of potential until all the super loud talking and screaming started. The plot and rooms at that point just get jumbled and messy. Hard to follow along with everyone yelling at the top of their lungs.Oh and the ending, OMEGAH THE ENDING. Would have been kinda cool if the games master was Jigsaw. Instead they hint at a sequel. Go do a real escape room instead of wasting your time with this garbage.","

"Escape Room","vengeance20","26 January 2019","Pretty much sums up this film, which I just seen a preview of tonight.The film starts with 6 young 20 somethings being brought together to take part in a mysterious Escape Room event. Each of them was the soul survivor of an horrific accident in their past lives, but each of these strangers has no idea why they were selected, or whose is behind it the event in the first place. So as you'd know, the group are put into an escape room, & there follows the typical traits of an escape room, find clues & figure out how to escape the room. But this room leads to another & then clues & revelations of their pasts start to unfold as the film goes on.I found the film to be pretty decent. It had the Saw & Belko Experiment themes going on & I can't help but feel the Now You See Me Films have a sort of reference in this mind**** of a film along with Hellraiser also playing a role too. It had a solid ending which leaves a door open for a sequel. (I hope!)But my complaints of the film were that it wasn't gory, in fact, it was almost bloodless. Reason for my complaint on that was the kind of promise that this was going to be like Saw. Now although I know full well this was a 15+, I still feel the gore could've been kicked up to a near Saw standard. I also felt the deaths were pretty crap & unimaginative, I mean, this film had the potential to make the death sequences unique given how unique the sets & rooms were in this film.The film was pretty much a dulled down version of what Saw is pretty much. It's solid, unique & entertaining, but could've been gorier & more fast paced, the film dragged a bit to be honest. I also felt the film went off the rails a bit & could've been more grounded.But overall it was a pretty decent film. It had both good & bad points to it, but it was unique in its own right. Though it could've been gorier, with the deaths being better & more grounded topped with a fast paced treatment.7/10","

"Escape Room","Orby2283","7 February 2021","I for one was sucked into this movie through curiosity. A movie about escape room(s) that will literally kill you? I am so in. While the movie does lend itself some really good ideas those ideas seem very bare minimum. While all the actors are really good everything around them is not.A very predictable plot that you could probably guess right off the get go. And despite the cast giving it their all the characters in this movie lack more development, some times they all come off as a-holes, and other times you wanna root for them.The escape room ideas themselves don't seem as fleshed out enough, they could have been more interesting ideas around this premise but it all felt very standard. while tense in some places, the pacing didn't let you sink in that time to really feel that suspense.Average movie overall with a good premise and good acting, but very little in terms of interest. I might watch it again if its on, but its not something I'd recommend unless you were really curious about this type of movie premise.","

I actually got a movie that had pretty good character development. One that made me care about each character enough to not want any of them to die. It actually makes you want to know more about their backstory.Each scene was pretty well thought out and didn't feel too rushed except the ending, which I felt was a bit rushed. I liked how each character didn't just look out for themselves but actually cared about the group. It showed that humanity can care for more, which is a message I definitely didn't expect to see in a movie like this.","

"Escape Room","jcosully","5 January 2019","In comparison to other January thrillers, Escape Room definitely stands out against the others. It excels ahead of Insidious: The Last Key, The Bye Bye Man, The Forest, And The Woman In Black 2: Angel Of Death, which are all January releases. Granted, Escape Room isn't amazing, not even great, but it is definitely a step forward in the right direction. I would definitely recommend this if you like thrillers, and if you are on the fence, go see it. It's not great, but if you go in not expecting much, it's pretty enjoyable.The first thing that really stands out is the set design. Each of the rooms has its own distinctive style, filled up with small objects that make the rooms feel more realistic, but not too crowded. They feel like real escape rooms, and each room was thought out as to how they would affect a certain character and their thoughts. The characters were also fine, the movie did just the right amount of backstory, providing enough information so we know the characters and some of their backstories, but not too much so the thrills don't get bogged down by an overload of emotions. The actors themselves do an okay job, the standouts being Deborah Ann Woll and Logan Miller. The only really bad performance was Nik Dodani, but it was obvious that no thought was really put into the character, because he was just a throwaway. The deaths in the movie were also good, because there wasn't much of a focus on the gore (to keep the PG-13 rating) but it actually works out, so the movie doesn't really slow down at any point to show bleeding out characters, or have long emotional scenes. There is really only one sentimental death, but it also doesnt stay too long on that. The brisk pace of the movie keeps everything going, never stopping, so it stays entertaining. That alone is probably the best part of the movie, it never loses it entertainment value. It's fun to watch characters solve their way through the rooms, just narrowly escaping death. Even though the characters are very one dimensional, you still root for them. The last great thing about this movie is that it knows what it is. It doesn't try to be a super sophisticated twisty thriller. There were so many opportunities for it to have huge twists, but it ignored those, and just kept moving along. That made the movie a lot easier to enjoy.The movie does falter though, and it does especially during the third act. There are huge plot holes that leave so many questions, and that aspect was really frustrating. It became unrealistic at one point, and there were just lazy excuses made to cover it up. This all happened toward the end, which factors into the ending. I personally don't think that the ending was as terrible as everyone says, but it still wasn't very good. It spent the final minutes setting up for a sequel, instead of creating a satisfying conclusion. It just branches farther and farther out, making a million different possibilities for sequels and franchises. Even though the ending was bad, I'd go pay to see the sequelOverall, I'd definitely recommend Escape Room. It's isn't great, but it is better then most January movies, and if you like horror movies or thrillers, go see this. If you go into it with no expectations whatsoever, you'll probably come out pleasantly surprised.","

"Escape Room","thirtyfivestories","29 January 2019","Exactly one year after his last feature film that saw him ending (fingers-crossed) the outlived Insidious franchise, Adam Robitel returns to begin another franchise that surely will not have the lifespan of the one it is imitating. He delivers a pilot installment that maybe only Jason Blum would be proud of, hitting various Blumhouse beats with more enthusiasm than even last year's game-to-film adaption Truth or Dare managed. These Blumian (a descriptor I am pained to invent) tropes include characters reading aloud text like a zealous mother, a clunky ten minute group ice-breaking session that clinically checks all the expository boxes, and the ""twist-ception(s)"".Six individuals all receive the same elegantly quirky puzzle box from colleagues and loved ones. Ben, a grocery boy, attempts to use brute force to open the cube, while Zoey, a physics student scribbles diagrams and notes as she unlocks what is an invitation to the world's most immersive escape room. Jason, a financial wizard, utilizes YouTube tutorials to crack his gift, and apparently the $10,000 prize for escaping still appeals to a man who initially expected a Prius key when his package first arrived. After all the participants are gathered in a waiting room of a seemingly barren high-rise, we're introduced to a happy-go-lucky trucker dad, a gamer boy turned escape room enthusiast, and an intimidating woman (her caricature is revealed later) rounding out the players now trapped in what will become an architecturally perplexing series of rooms.The clues scattered throughout the rooms are just barely more subtle than the hints plopped into the dialogue revealing the unifying trait of all the participants. It is far from a spoiler to comment on how painfully obvious that the escape room is more a social experiment than a game. However, our gamer boy Danny tries his darndest to immerse us into the game by effectively giving a ""Escape Rooms 101"" lecture to the gang. Trucker dad Mike eats this up with great appreciation as will many audiences who aren't privy to the new entertainment craze. This goes beyond exposition dumping, and feels eerily similar to an in-game tutorial, which oddly enough, doesn't feel right in a movie.Where the film lacks creativity in character development, its set design flourishes with imaginative decisions that tie into the players' pasts with relative frequency, providing a human anchor to an otherwise procedural death trot similar to the cult beloved Cube. An upside down jukebox bar steals the show by offering the most integrated use of clues worthy of an indie walking simulator game remake. But collect all the rooms together, and the difficulty curve resembles a goose bump: not challenging in the slightest. I knew that this would be where this film lived or died, and it perished early into the first room when I hacked the game's system and saw a much more efficient solution involving glasses and a couch. I effectively mentally speed-ran the rooms in an effort to milk joy from my viewing.If predictability is the film's greatest sin, then the dialogue is the lesser sin. The performances from the auxiliary characters are particularly rigid, but this too can be blamed on down-right lazy writing that at one point has a college professor give our wiz kid Zoey an extracurricular homework assignment of ""doing one thing that scares you"". Yet I'm still fearful of a potentially greater sin lurking in the closing moments of what I'll call the fourth act of an otherwise brisk movie: the sequel(s) option. The same blue-balls Netflix original series ""binge me some more daddy"" gut punch arose, and now SONY's plan was revealed. Once again, I do not view this as being in the spoiler family, because what is inevitable is inevitable.Now only time will tell if they can rise to sustained success that Twisted Pictures basked in with the 8-film series chronicling a sinister puzzle designer. The difference here is tragically obvious, Escape Room's puzzle designer is totally morally deprived. There must be a method to the madness, this mastermind only has business propelling their madness, which I'm saddened to report doesn't generate the intriguing tension between torturer and victim that its gorier predecessors at least attempted to balance. Speaking of gore, my first ""so PG-13 is what we're going to do?"" badge of 2019 goes to this gem for copying the formula, but diluting it in the process. A worthy excuse to create a dungeon crawler thriller I will admit, but contrary to gamer boy Danny's hilariously ignorant exclamation after barely evading flames, this one is far from immersive.","

"Escape Room","kryptonarie","11 April 2019","Out of the 3-4 escape room movies I've seen, this is one of the best. Sure, the premise of this film is nothing new, and yes the acting is a bit weak at times, but the characters were still effective within their particular roles and/or type of people they represented. What I liked was how details about the characters were presented, how they were used as a nexus to tie the characters to specific puzzle elements in each of the rooms. The Escape Room was more original from other movies I've seen of this type. Lastly, the level of action from start to finish was good, and it kept me watching to see what would happen next. I thought Panic Room was more than a reasonably entertaining bit of escapism for my brain.","

The room design was nice especially the upside down room, I like the performance of Logan Miller, I think he was the best one in the movie.","

"Escape Room","lukasmatkovicdm","4 August 2020","First movie of 2019. A great year for film started really underwhelming. It'sa cool concept done really poorly. It has no identity it's just so safe. Even bad ones you know Saw film when you see one. But this one just holds back sooo much. First two acts are just Pg-13 Saw and then 3rd act gives such bad answers. On the positive side production design and rooms were well done. I gotta get credit where credit is due. Rooms by themselves were kinda fun. It's decently shot and better than most low budget thrillers. Some actors were fine (not all of them). 8 pool room sequence was really cool. That's it. Film takes itself way too seriously and it just doesn't want to have fun. If it was more self aware and tongue-in cheek it could've work. Characters were unlikeable and awful. They didn't get developed and on top of that most of them are just bad. And nerd character was so annoying. They were very stupid in their decisions too. Because of them puzzles weren't as tense and egaging as they need to be. Pacing is not good as well. First 2 puzzles just took so much of time and then other rooms were incredibly rushed. Acting was wooden. Thank God main actress went on to Waves because this is... Last 30 minutes give answers. Answers are not explained all the way because of the intrigue (I mean sequels) but answers that they do give were nonsensical and just confusing. Like who are this guy who just watches people die? How can they erase whole rooms? How can they make room on the fricking plane?! Holes were so big.
Overall: Mess that could've been great self aware comedy but it's not.

"Escape Room","alexmartinezoz","4 January 2019","Going into this movie I had zero expectations. I was pleasantly surprised by the film at the beginning due to its concept. The film was very tense and entertaining for the first 3 escape rooms but after that the plot and writing fell apart in my opinion. As a result the film became very predictable. The ending was meh at best and they set the movie up for a sequel I have no interest in seeing. I give this a 6 because I enjoyed the first half of the film but it didn't finish strong at all. I'm an A-list stubs member so this movie didn't technically cost me anything but if it did I'd be a little disappointed. Overall, if you're a fan of suspense horrors like Saw and The Belko Experiment ( a movie I absolutely dislike) you'll enjoy this one.","

"Escape Room","thesar-2","18 August 2020","I had a hearty laugh 55 seconds in when one of the opening production company logos was for ""Original Films"" and this is THE THIRD MOVIE CALLED ""ESCAPE ROOM"" in as many years.Actually 2 were made in 2017, only one was released in 2018 and this third, unrelated entry was showed in 2019. Now, so far, I've made it past the 2018 released one and this 2019 ""final"" movie with the title. I actually really liked the 2018 edition. And now I LOVE the 2019 one.It is, in fact ""Original."" This 2019 Escape Room couldn't be further from the 2018 released one. Which is a good thing. Now we can enjoy both.I digress. This movie was fantastic. It's for Saw Movie Lovers. It's for Escape Room fanatics. It's for Strangers Thrust into a Game/Cube and have to work their way out. Only this time: I actually gave a damn about the characters.Yes, I've seen the three Cube movies, the eight Saw films, the Single-Digit Belko Experiment and called The Game a GREAT movie. But, this time, I genuinely cared about each and EVERY character. Well, only one was an asshole, but he still attempted to help other victims 50% of the time.Basically, six strangers receive a boxed invite to win $10,000 for being ""the ONE"" who survives a known unbeatable Escape Room in Chicago. Only, early on, it becomes apparent this...Is.... REAL. Now our stranger victim/main players have to solve riddles, learn about themselves and help each other out to survive this deathtrap series of rooms of which they should be familiar with.I DID care when a character died or did what they could for others. It was SUPER nice to see not the worst in humanity as we normally get in these movies where unwilling victims fight amongst themselves with survival instincts and flat-out murder each other to live. This cast actually tried to be human or moralistic.I loved the sets and world-building, the dialogue/jokes had me rolling, the acting NEVER lagged and aside from them starting on a 3rd floor of a Chicago Highrise, I truly believed in all the peril these people were put in. You want tension, suspense, horror and human redemption, check out 2019's Escape Room. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.And quite frankly, who can say THAT about a January release?***Final thoughts: I try not to do any research on a film I really want to see beforehand. So, it was a nice and pleasant surprise to see a long-time crush of mine was in this: Tyler Labine. BUT, more importantly: Deborah Ann Woll was another one of the cast. I LOVED her as Jessica in True Blood and it took me a little while to get used to her as a Human Role instead of supernatural in the TV series. But at least it was good to see her again, since the series died. Wish I could say the same for Labine...he's NOT as cute as he used to be. Sigh.","

"Escape Room","youngcollind","8 December 2021","It's not original by any stretch, I scrolled past three other films called Escape Room with virtually identical premises on the way to write this review. Not to mention the influence of Cube, as well as real life escape rooms, a popular trend apparently begging for a cinematic interpretation.The performances are imperfect, occasionally throwing out corny dialogue, and often pushing the boundaries of realism, even within the over the top scenario.But does any of this matter?What the film does put on the table is a family friendly rendition of the death game setup, boasting a bigger budget than any of the preexisting Escape Rooms. This results in some awesome production design making for some very inventive traps. If you can allow yourself to get wrapped up in the simple pleasures of ""oh no, how are they gonna get out of this one"" then it can be a fun ride. It's mindless entertainment in the best possible way.It unfortunately ends on a sequel bating cliffhanger, which I'm hoping isn't part of a larger trend as some films just aren't franchise worthy and should probably wrap things up in their allotted time.","

"Escape Room","petereviews","8 September 2019","The Good: I had no intention of watching this film until reviews consistently said it was worth an afternoon tv watch, which I have to agree after watching it for free.Wisely steering away from horror, the movie is a fun little thriller, ratcheting the tension up in each escape room. These escape rooms are the highlight of the movie, as some of the clues to solve them are particularly clever, especially in the first room.While I expected the characters to be detestable, I was surprised to find most of them likeable and for me to actually be rooting for them. While they are cliches, they bounce off each other quite well.The Bad: The actively bad section was the final 20 minutes where it becomes revealed why these people were put there. The explanation was ridiculous, and it was very shameless how the movie did it's sequel-bait.Apart from this, nothing was actively bad apart from this movie not being particularly exceptional.Film Highlight: In the first escape room where the characters find out things are not what they seem. The tension here was raised magnificently.Conclusion: Recommend watching as a light afternoon or evening watch.","

"Escape Room","Floated2","21 May 2020","Having little to no interest when saw the trailers of this film but assuming Escape Room to be somewhat of watered down ""PG13"" version of Saw- marketed towards the teen and younger crowd. Then seeing praise and surprise of a decent film from fans alike.This film is somewhat surprising on a good way as it does what it is intended too. It is entertaining and not boring throughout and provides enough thrills and interest. Solid characters although stereotypical, but we get to know them and do start to root for them.For a B rate thriller type, people seem to have much higher than needed be expectations. The trailers show exactly what type of film to expect. Don't watch the film expecting an amazing complex plot or articulate acting. Simply for the suspense, thrills and journey and you shouldn't be disappointed.Although the ending was clear sequel bait, it worked as there will be an Escape Room 2. Which will undoubtedly make a lot of money. The studios have a solid franchise and we expect to see more after the second. There are endless ideas at hand. As for now looking forward to the follow up.","

"Escape Room","eddie_baggins","11 November 2019","It may not make an ounce of sense and it at times features some questionable acting and directing choices, but when watched with the right frame of mine, Escape Room is the perfect escapist piece of entertainment that will be a lot of fun for anyone that loves a good puzzle/Saw like thriller.Taking the worlds obsession with escape rooms to a whole new level by adding a life and death spin on the popular past time activity, Adam Robitel's low-budget but well-staged horror thriller is one of those nicely constructed genre entries that never takes itself too seriously and fully embraces it's over the top concept to provide some memorable kills, set-pieces and twisting and turning narrative that seemingly wants to set up future installments.Opening with a hurry as we are thrown into an escape room that doesn't seem like a whole lot of fun, Robitel quickly introduces us to a range of characters that form the basis of our main team of escapees, with Taylor Russell's brainiac student Zoey, Logan Miller's supermarket working slacker Ben and Jay Ellis's snobbish businessman Jason forming the core of our disposable group of humans, who are all nothing more than thinly drawn caricatures and pawns for the films money making concept of a genuine real life escape room where a failure means perma-death.By very early on realizing what it is and what people want from the experience, Escape Room finds a very fun groove as we move from room to room with our collection of players that find themselves under threat from a room of fire, an icy solitude or a disappearing elevator shaft, plus other threats and the film creates a game within itself as we begin to create wagers in our minds about who will escape and who will not.Much like recent horror success Happy Death Day, Escape Room makes a nice space for itself by providing a fun and over the top horror yarn that is more thriller than chiller and while hardcore genre fans may be disappointed by the lack of scares or gore in the film, its inventiveness and creativity will keep you entertained throughout, even if you do wish the people we are playing this game with were a little more likeable and unique, making the stakes of the whole dastardly affair that much more engaging.Final Say -A fun, silly and totally enjoyable romp, Escape Room is not fine dining cinema but its willingness to accept what it is and run with it means another adventure in Adam Robitel's freshly created universe is something to look forward to.3 defibrillators out of 5","

However, each room that the players enter has a connection to one of their pasts. The guilty party must expose the secret in order to get the combination to the lock. But with teammates dropping fast, those remaining must unmask the gamemaster before time runs out.Piggybacking on the popularity of locked rooms and the torture horror movie craze, this low-budget ensemble does have some intense moments, but the derivative and inconclusiveness ending derails everything that came before it.Besides, the easiest way to breakout of an escape room is to take the teenage attendant hostage.

As a claustrophobic horror movie where the characters are killed one by one by puzzles you would expect some more imagination and shock values.I watched it to the end, so it kept me interested late at night.Not sure why this has a 15 certificate.

And that's actually a good thing, cause every time those movies wanna do a super clever charade or something, they end up being lame (with a few exceptions).

The characters never did anything wrong (except 1), unlike in SAW, when they all did something wrong or hated life. Instead, these characters are brought together by unfortunate tragedies that led them to have to fight for survival. The characters are not the stereotypical ""blonde, stoner, virgin, smart guy, and buff guy."" They are all unique and the female leads are so powerful. One served in Iraq and the other is African American studying Quantam Physics. There is also the super smart guy who has played escape rooms many times before. More than one incredibly smart person who is also a virgin. Most of the movie is completely unpredictable and has you on the edge of your seat for most of it. It is so brilliantly played out and has numerous twists and turns I never saw coming. Most horror movies nowadays are predictable or based on jump scares, but this one was completely psychological and made you really feel for the characters. 9/10 beautifully made, coolest horror movie I have seen in a very long time!","

It played out exactly like the countless other similar movies (like people put in a cabin in the woods, people put in a ghost house, people put in actual mazes, etc. )There is nothing new .. not even the effects. The acting was .. well, its hard to say because it seemed not very challenging (considering that they all play stereotypes with little to no depth)I cannot recommend that movie.","

The movie was not superficial, they actually did the effort and connected it well to the characters and their past.","

"Escape Room","HafizhMaulana21","2 December 2022","Six strangers meet each other in one room which becomes a deadly game. They have to solve the puzzles of each game to be able to survive and escape.Escape Room is one of the films that performs poorly. This movie doesn't have a great appeal. By presenting the concept of survival from a deadly game, this film appears so bad both in terms of the story and dialogue presented. Escape Room has a story plot that is not well constructed. A story that feels bland and shallow. In each of his scenes there is no such strong tension. The film feels so flat. It doesn't provide enough emotional side to present the conflict that's being built. The conflict presented also cannot be regarded as a conflict. Dialogue that is not constructive and seems perfunctory in dialogue. No dialogue is the key to a mystery. How not, in dangerous situations there seems to be an expression of each character that is not like a panicked person. Their look was so flat and sucky.Although it has a good story concept, this film does not have a good execution. The cast lineup is uninteresting and performs far from what we imagined. How they perform and act like zombies playing a movie. Have no emotions and are incapable of building their character.","

"Escape Room","karlakreso","16 April 2019","I really liked the movie, there were good scenes filled with anticipation but how the events played out in the end kinda ruined the movie and I'm talking about the part where that game master or whatever dude tries to kill that long haired dude, that girl comes in and shoots him. And I'm pretty sure I saw blood if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me but the dude just gets up and runs like nothing happened and when he attackes girl there's shot of his back and there's no gunshot wound whatsoever. Also when that girl escapes her room how exactly did she find her way to those two?? I don't suppose it should be easy since the building is huge I mean I know that's the plot and something that has to happen for the story to keep going. But still. Escaping the room was also easy... oh and I forgot this, when that long haired dude got strangled he was dead, there was x over his picture, then he came back to life. Same thing happened with the girl there was x over her then she came back and that game master dude was thrown into the game like how does that work?? Is that camera supper smart? She knows when people die, when people are alive, she understands what is going on so she can make decisions in game orrr is there someone behind camera if there is then that girl couldn't have escaped bc I suppose there are cameras everywhere in that place and people behind this surely wouldn't have left their own people to die especially if they're important. Which that dude was. Also how did they know every single detail about them? Especially in situations like them singing car in a song. How would you know that? Maybe dude mentioned it when he was in a hospital but I don't like them(people behind this)being portrayed like gods, knowing every single little detail. I want an explanation how they got to that information.
Again it's good movie I really enjoyed it, but they could've put a little more effort into it.","

"Escape Room","thekarmicnomad","30 April 2019","A group of seemingly unrelated people win a competition to play an escape room.
Obviously the game soon turns into a desperate struggle for survival.This is a great little horror movie with a touch of sleuthing thrown in.
The traps are scary and unpleasant but without the gore and brutality of say Saw.
The characters are less stereotyped than normal horror but you can still pick out the jock, greedy banker, over achiever, nerd etc.The affects stand up ok but be prepared to squint at the places where the CGI budget ran thin.There is nothing amazing about this film but it does what it sets out to do - for which I applaud it.
It doesn't try to be as dark or stylised as ""The Cube"", this is happier being lighter and more accessible.I feel it went a bit too far at the end and wasn't really sold on the direction the post film was taking.This won't blow your mind but you will have an entertaining ninety minutes.","

"Escape Room","tonyjcole94","19 January 2019","I had seen the 2017 movie with the same title which was absolutely horrible. So I didnt have high expectations for this film. I did see the trailer and it gave me strong ""Saw"" vibes so I went in thinking it'd be a saw copycat without the impact.While there are ""saw"" and ""hostel"" elements , this film add it's own flavor to the survival film franchise. Throughout the film we get short glimpses of each characters' tragic past which helps us as the audience actually care about these people. There is something for mostly everybody to relate to so it can sorta feel like you could be in this situation. And that's the beauty of a film , making the audience feel in that moment like they are there.The acting is hit or miss at times and there are a few corny lines, but above all this was an intense film that was also comical at times. It seemed to have taken inspiration from a plethora of survival films and kind of merged them into one film , using an original modern day scenario ; seeing as though escape rooms have become very popular in recent years.Creepy , Intense, Gut Churning, and Funny. Go see it !","

However, the whole thing starts to feel pointless by around the mid-way mark, when it becomes clear that we're just watching innocent people being tortured. And it's even worse when it gets to the end, as the reason for everything happening turns out to be lame. There are also a lot of unanswered questions.Overall, this is the type of show that you may want to watch if you're bored. But go in with low expectations.","

"Escape Room","Lucas-Thor","6 January 2020","Escape room (2019)Escape room starts of with a scene that comes into play later. This was not something i liked. Throughout the whole movie I knew who was gonna be the last one standing, because of that first scene. It ruined a bit of the fun in guessing who was gonna survive. Now the end of the movie makes up for the first scene, which i am happy it did. Anyway, let's go back to the start.Six strangers gets invited to this ""escape room"". The six character are very stereotypical, but i didn't mind. One thing i did mind was that i didn't care for any of them. I thought someone was the main character, but she honestly didn't do much in a big chunk of the movie. MAny of the other character i found relatively annoying. So the characters weren't the best part of the movie.The premise i found rather fun. I like movies like this, were a few different characters has to make it through different rooms, all with lethal challenges. I think the rooms in this movie are all good and creative. So that part i liked. I liked how the room were connected and all the challenges. You do have to accept this movies reality though. It is not exactly the most realistic movie.Minor spoiler.The ending sets up for a sequel and honestly, even though this movie was kinda dumb and the ending was really dumb, I don't mind and I would probably enjoy a sequel.
Final thoughts:
If you can turn off your brain, accept this movies reality and ignore the characters(and maybe skip the first scene) This movie can be a fun watch. I admit that is quite a lot you have to do to enjoy this movie and i get that, therefore many will probably dislike this movie a lot and i won't argue. But i found this kinda fun.6/10","

Of course not. It takes what's been before and adds its own take while capitalising in the explosion (no pun intended) on escape rooms.A fun ride.
