"1","evanston_dad","7 August 2017","James McAvoy gives what could have potentially been an award-worthy performance if it had appeared in a different film.He plays a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps three young girls as a part of a plot two of the personalities have hatched to unleash a powerful and unstoppable identity. Betty Buckley, in a better performance than the role necessarily needed, plays a therapist working with him and who begins to unravel the alarming plot. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, who hasn't made a movie I've wanted to see since ""Signs,"" crafts a nifty and effective thriller with three fourths of his film, and then sort of if not completely ruins it by taking his idea too far and pushing the supernatural elements to the point where we realize we're not even watching the same kind of movie we were at the beginning. This particular story, and especially McAvoy's performance, would have been compelling enough without Shyamalan's characteristic inability to understand when he's ruining his own premise.Grade: B","

"2","arniecage","2 July 2018","A fantastic performance by the film's star, James McAvoy is reason alone to watch this film. Every personality on display is distinct to the other, and he is so interesting to watch. Anya who was breath-taking in The Witch does a fine job here too. This is a film where M. Night Shyamalan reasserts himself as a serious director following a string of poor films. I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel and the conclusion of the Unbreakable series arriving in January. 8.5/10.","

The premise of the film seems quite superficial at first but as the layers are peeled back there's so much more beneath.It's a horror film without special effects gore, an action flick without any car chases. A high-tension psychological thriller for viewers with active imaginations, who don't need to be spoon-fed every explanation.The acting is top-notch, the script sympathetic, the cinematography and set fantastic, and the music/sound subtle enough not to be noticed, consciously, while building the tension inexorably. It's gripping, un-turn-away-able.Seriously impressive. I don't give 10's lightly.","

"4","TheMovieDiorama","27 February 2018","Ahhhhhh I am so disappointed with this! I really wanted to love it, it ticks all the right boxes for a decent thriller. Yet somehow Shyamalan missed the mark. It's not bad, in fact it's crafted intricately...just not great. A man with 23 different personalities abducts three young girls as he prepares to unleash the 24th personality that dominates the others. This is extremely difficult to review. For every positive outcome there is a negative to counteract it. For example: Kevin's internal survival against the other personalities was an intriguing and compelling concept. However, the enthralling psychological analysis was negated by the stupidity of this whole 24th personality that is able to physically change Kevin. A thought provoking theme is decimated by an unrealistic concept in an attempt to be dramatic. It didn't need to be! The first act was going so well with interesting ideas that Shyamalan clearly has an interest in. His focus on this multiple personality disorder shows in the film. Patient and psychologist conversations take place that explains Kevin's fractured mind. Then it constantly shifts to the thriller aspect where these three young girls are trying to escape from a sinister location. It's not exciting. At all. These girls aren't put in any real danger or hardly attempt to flee so what's the point? They just exist for the finale which as a result makes the film absurdly boring. These girls are lifeless. Except Taylor-Joy's character who actually has some decent backstory, told through flashbacks. Split is a tool for James McAvoy to showcase multiple fantastic performances. Genuinely creepy and unnerving. His ability to automatically switch characters was faultless and found him to be highly enjoyable. Also like the final scene which harks back to a certain film which I shall not name. I look forward to future prospects. But in the end, Split was a failed attempt at a thriller but an intriguing psychological drama. It's unfortunate the two just didn't blend for me.","

"5","crberme","22 October 2017","I was surprised to see that this movie was released last year (as I'm writing this) and I didn't heard about it, taking in consideration how promising the plot is.Split is about three girls get kidnapped by a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID) that has 23 personalities. I have to say that this movie does not represent what DID really is and how people who struggle with it are, mainly because this movie gets a bit too fantastical sometimes. It doesn't try to be strictly realistic though, so it's an awesome thriller anyway.The movie gives you chills since the very start with an awesome acting by James McAvoy and some seriously good still scenes. The overall scenes make you have a weird feeling, something it succeeds to transfer to the viewer that you probably won't be able to describe. That makes this thriller stand out in a good way.Maybe Split makes a unrealistic representation of dissociative identity disorder, and that can be a big turnoff, but this is a great movie nonetheless.","

He should have won some awards for his performance of a man with many different personalities. James was very convincing in every part he played. The end is great but I don't want to give anything away so I won't comment on that at all. Well written and the actors were perfect. Watch it today, just don't make the mistake of downloading a different movie called Split about bowling. I did that and that is one of the worst movies I ever saw!","

"7","Sleepin_Dragon","1 February 2017","Whether you've enjoyed or loathed the last few movies from M Night Shyamalan I don't think any of us could disagree the talent is still there, and after a few misfires comes Split. I can say unequivocally that this is the best thing I have watched in a long time time.The first thing I think this film will be remembered for is the stellar performance of lead actor James Mcavoy, a wonderfully charismatic and talented actor, I'm sure most of us adore, I feel here he's announced himself as a serious contender for mega roles. His ability to switch from one persona to another, to be dark, sinister, camp, soft, cute etc. is incredible, people sat around me watching the movie were stunned at how good he was. The Dennis, Hedwig and Patricia characters in particular show his total versatility.A brilliant supporting cast, Betty Buckley did a fantastic job as Kevin's doctor, as did the trio of girls, Anya Taylor-Joy I thought was especially good.I make it sound like he's the only reason to see the film, far from it, the opening is gripping, the story itself so chilling, and the ending a real surprise.I implore you, see this in the cinema.","

"8","grantss","13 November 2017","A man kidnaps three teenage girls and holds them prisoner in a basement. He has multiple personality disorder, and is the prize patient of Dr Karen Fletcher, who is using him as case study in the condition. Several of his 23 personalities make their appearance to the girls. While none of them seem particularly harmful, there are indications that there lurks inside of him an ultra-strong and violent personality, The Beast.Written and directed by M Night Shyamalan, I was hoping this would be a return to something like the form of his earlier films. Yes, it would be difficult to match the brilliance of The Sixth Sense but something approaching great would be a good start. Unfortunately his trajectory over the last 11 years or so has been decidedly downwards with some monumentally bad movies - The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender (plus, probably, After Earth - I haven't seen it but apparently it is incredibly bad).So I was quite disappointed when I actually watched this, especially in the first half of the movie. Script, by Shyamalan, is weak, and padded. There was heaps of potential in the concept and themes but this is not used effectively.The biggest problem is that the initial plot is contrived and implausible. It hinges on you believing that the three girls would allow themselves to be held captive. They have plenty of opportunities to overwhelm the captor, but don't, and even when they actually figure on doing that we have a very weak and contrived reason for them not doing it.Plus there is a lot of padding to the movie. While the captor's visits to Dr Fletcher do add some depth to his character(s) and to her side of the story, much of it is unnecessary.So for the first half (even more) I was mostly sitting there thinking ""This is so unrealistic, just escape already!"" and getting bored at some of the discussions.It gets more intriguing and exciting in the second half, and starts to make more effective use of the multiple personality device, but that doesn't make up for the poor start.Can't fault the performances though. James McAvoy is great as the captor, having to essentially play about nine roles, and have to switch between them in a heartbeat. Anya Taylor-Joy is solid as Casey, with good support from Betty Buckley, as Dr Fletcher, and Haley Lu Richardson and Jessica Sula as the other two kidnapped girls.On the whole, not great, and certainly not in the same league as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable or even The Village, but better than most of the stuff M Night Shyamalan has dished up over the last 11 years. A step in the right direction, at least.","

I gave him another chance after hearing so many people raving about this movie, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellently acted, directed and thought out movie. It's intense, funny at some parts, and it is incredibly well thought out. Don't listen to haters just because they don't like Shyamalan's movies.

"10","LloydBayer","6 February 2017","What a terrific comeback for Shyamalan! Many have been vocal that horror writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has been on a downward spiral after having peaked with Unbreakable, his very own superhero origins film. Split sees the continuation of Shyamalan's tryst with the supernatural but also a long awaited rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to resurface. While his last film - The Visit - was predictable but entertaining, Split underscores his storytelling prowess with the high level of creativity that made him a household name in contemporary horror.Yet fans will concur that Split isn't just a comeback either, rather a tactical setup of Shyamalan's very own cinematic universe. Put literally, the film is about a person with multiple personalities where each personality speaks collectively in full awareness of the rest. Although main character Kevin is said to exhibit 23 personalities, we see just a handful during most of the film. There's Barry, a New York fashionista, Hedwig, a goofy 9-year-old, and darker personalities Patricia and Dennis. Calling themselves The Horde, the latter two have influenced the abduction of three high school girls as a ritualistic sacrifice for the 24th personality often referred to as ""The Beast"". The girls have limited time before The Beast is unleashed and although paralysed by fear, their escape depends on protagonist Casey's (Anya Taylor-Joy) proactive deconstruct of the good and evil personalities that reside in Kevin. To her advantage and through revelatory flashbacks, we learn that this wouldn't be the first time Casey would confront a monster.If Edward Norton's dual personalities was chilling in his debut film Primal Fear, wait till you get a load of James McAvoy in what is simply an outstanding performance of versatility (or should I say two dozen performances in one film?). More than just a demanding role to pull off, McAvoy's broad range in this film has also elevated what could have been a familiar antagonist into a nerve wrecking supervillain. Which is why Shyamalan's so called signature twist ending is almost astounding. To be honest there isn't an actual twist in the story, but the ending is an unexpected but seamless integration into a sort of trilogy that will have most viewers gob smacked. It's an inside joke and almost as if Shyamalan is asking if we have you been watching closely, but also an extremely rewarding Easter egg for every true fan of the man. Welcome back Mr. Shyamalan!","

"11","roniksharma","1 October 2016","Shyamalan had his debut with the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' followed by positively reviewed movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. After that, he went through a series of duds with 'Lady In The Water' , 'The Village' , 'The Happening' , 'After Earth' and was termed one of the worst directors of all time with 'The Last Airbender'. But, he made a decent comeback with 2015's 'The Visit' which received generally positive reviews and he's back at his game with 'Split'.After a birthday party, three girls, led by Casey, are kidnapped by the troubled Kevin, who has a very rare case of 23 split personalities inside him. What follows is how the three girls try to escape from Kevin who himself is lowly having a mental breakdown. Sorry, I can't tell a lot about this movie as a small factor would spoil it.This movie couldn't have worked without James McAvoy. He has given his best performance in his whole career and stands out as one of the reasons to watch this movie. The cliché points in the movie are watchable just because of his phenomenal performance. His transition from a 'Norman Bates' type woman Patrica to a 9 year old boy Hedwig to other personalities are amazingLast but not the least, is the traditional ""Shyamalan Twist"". Trust me, this time your minds will be blown when you come to the conclusion. This twist doesn't match up to the ""The Sixth Sense"" one but it's a thrilling one. It's not some stupid twist like in ""Signs"". I won't forget that moment when someone behind me shouted out ""WHAAAAT?!"".""Split"" isn't scary, it's tense. This movie shouldn't have been given a ""horror"" tag. A ""psychological thriller"" sounds better. Nevertheless, this movie is worth a watch. I'm giving a 8/10 with one extra star just for James McAvoyWelcome back, M.Night Shyamalan","

"12","kirbylee70-599-526179","11 June 2017","There are some director's whose name alone brings forth images of the films they have made. If you hear Hitchcock you know a slow paced thriller is on the way. Spielberg? Normally a family styled big budget adventure. And when you hear M. Night Shyamalan you expect something different. Not always the same but unlike most movies you will see. That holds true with his latest release SPLIT.As the film opens three young girls are kidnapped with no clue who is behind it or where they've been taken. Rather than a simple hostage movie we're seeing something different. The girls find their kidnapper to be stern and unwilling to give into their pleas for help. But then they see him again. Except that it's not quite him.This is when we learn that the kidnapper, Kevin (James McAvoy) is suffering from dissociative identity disorder or what most people would call multiple personalities. When he shows up to the rooms they're being held in wearing a dress and telling them his name is Patricia the girls have no idea what to think. Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), the outsider of the trio, insists that they bide their time to figure a way out. The other two girls are more impulsive and act without thinking things through.When they meet ""Hedwig"" Casey thinks she may have found someone who can help her. She spends time gaining his trust and learning more about what is going on. He tells her about ""The Beast"" and warns that he is coming. When she later asks the ""others"" about ""The Beast"" she is rebuffed but learns just a little more with each conversation.Do the girls escape as the film moves forward? I'd rather not say and allow the story to surprise and unravel for each of you. But the movie does move on with more information gathered in various ways. One of those is the discussions between Kevin and his psychiatrist Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley). Fletcher has been treating Kevin for some time now and is becoming slightly alarmed via various signs that something has changed.Fletcher doesn't just spend time with Kevin though. While he insist that he is in control she convinces him to allow some of the ""others"" to talk to her. At different visits the multiple people within Kevin's mind are allowed to talk to her and discuss things with her. Each of them provides her with a greater sense of dread that something is happening.Back at the house where the girls are being kept, Casey continues to work her way into the good graces of Hedwig. As the bond between the two of them builds the slightest glimpse of hope appears that perhaps the girls will make it out after all. With no demands made to their parents just why they were kidnapped to begin with comes into question. And when the answer presents itself the level of tension and fear reaches fever pitch. Is there really a ""Beast"" or is that just something in the mind of Kevin.For me Shyamalan has been a hit and miss director. While I've never hated any of his films there have been a few that I felt had fallen a little short of the potential he showed in others. With SPLIT he returns to my good graces with a movie that draws you in, takes it's time to unfold and tells a story unlike any other. In a world of remakes that earns points with me. He definitely gives us something new here.The acting is amazing to watch here. While the entire cast does a fantastic job it is McAvoy who takes center stage and steals the show. It's one thing for an actor to portray a character in a movie. But to create several and have them all well thought out and well done characters? That's something worth paying attention to. The only problem would be trying to figure out which character would be the one receiving an Oscar nomination if it came to that.I noted remakes but what about sequels you might ask. SPOILER ALERT. This film is indeed a sequel but not so much that you would recognize it as such. We've never been exposed to these characters, never seen this world as far as we know and have no inkling that it ties into anything else. That is until the film is just about to hit the credits. At that time we see people talking in a diner and the camera pans down to reveal Bruce Willis sitting there listening to a conversation where someone is trying to recall the name of a terrorist who was in a wheelchair. He tells them the name was Mr. Glass. The name and his presence is a reference to Shyamalan's film UNBREAKABLE. And yes, this film ties into that. As will his next film, one he announced will complete a trilogy bringing all three films together. As a fan of that film I can't wait.Until then I'll be content to watch this movie. And probably more than once. It's one of those films that once you know the end you want to watch again to see what else you can pick up as the story unwinds. That makes it a movie worth not just watching but adding to the collection.","

"13","austinfromdahood","28 July 2018","Wow, this is my first review on IMDB. Let's start off with the movie that got me interested into film, and that movie is Split. I remember being 13 years old, sitting on my couch a few nights before halloween. I wanted to watch a horror film, so I browsed on the ""Free Movies"" section on Xfinity Demand. I scrolled down the page, and my eyes everted to Split. I read the plot synopsis, and I really liked the concept and watching the film for the first time was one of the best movie watching experiences I've ever had. I was glued to my seat the whole time watching the film and it genuinely scared me. I noticed how the movie builds suspense and I also paid attention to the interesting camera angles the cinematographer chose to shot. After watching the film, I was excited to watch more M. Night Shyamalan films, and that eventually built my love for film. James Mcavoy in this film has an oscar worthy performance, playing 23 different personalities. Anya Taylor Joy also had a very good performance in this film and she played a very interesting character. The techniques for building and showing suspense was masterful in this movie, and the cinematography in this film was golden. The story in this film was also very investing, and its twist and turns are very fun. At first I didn't understand the twist ending, but after browsing the internet, I found out it involved a character from Unbreakable, and watching that movie was also a treat. I'm 14 years old right now, and my passion for film will live on! Split is one of my favorite films of all time and it is a film I will always love.","

"14","kartiknnagar","24 September 2017","The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the amazing performance by James McAvoy, who is able to effectively and very convincingly portray wildly different characters almost effortlessly with minimal change in physical appearance and entirely through superb acting. One scene in particular has him cycling through three completely different personalities of his character at the drop of a hat, which is quite remarkable. The twist at the end is so disappointing that it is almost non-existent, those who have not watched the movie Unbreakable won't even understand the twist. At least this movie will keep you entertained and is not as atrociously paced as most of M. Night Shymalan's movies.","

"15","msbreviews","6 August 2017","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)James McAvoy plays Kevin, a man with a genetic disease which allows him to have multiple personalities. His trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), knows 23 of them, but there's one hidden from everyone who desires to dominate over all the others. Compelled by one of his personalities, Kevin abducts three girls, where Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) becomes their leader to try and escape the ""crazy"" man.Is this the return to form by M. Night Shyamalan, who has been struggling for more than a decade to release a major success? Is Split the movie that brings him back to the spotlight?Once again, Shyamalan's storytelling is very original, unconventional and ultimately mind-blowing. Instead of establishing everything the audience needs to know about the characters right at the beginning, he gradually develops them, giving them haunting backstories and spreading parts of it throughout the runtime. That said, this film isn't for everyone. The audience needs to trust Shyamalan and be patient. Really patient. Don't start taking notes about something that you think it's negative because once you reach the third act, everything changes and suddenly it all makes sense. The screenplay is not as twisty as Unbreakable, for example, but it demands absolute attention in order to catch up on all the things that matter (and the ones that don't, as well).The production and editing team have to be congratulated due to their seamless work. From the camera work to the extended one-take sequences, as well as the environment surrounding the characters, everything feels real and looks amazing. The soundtrack ... Let me just say that this element is so, but so much relevant to the conclusion of this movie. I can't really say anything else without spoiling the ending, so I'll leave a note after my rating at the end of the review with a MAJOR SPOILER.As for the cast, I'll start with the man that I honestly think should have received an Oscar nomination: James McAvoy. You know, there's a big difference in portraying a non-fiction character instead of a fiction one: concerning the former, you can't really escape the true nature of the person you are playing, but with the latter, as an actor/actress, you have to deliver yourself 100% to the role for it to be believable ... And God, does McAvoy deliver! He gives 200% in what could be his best performance to date. Do you think Andy Serkis had problems portraying both Gollum and Sméagol at the same time? Well, imagine 7 ... or 8 characters. I lost the count. All in all, James McAvoy, sir, congratulations! You are superb!Anya Taylor-Joy is also incredible as Casey! Her character has the most intriguing story of the three girls, and she's the one who assumes the leadership of the group once the kidnap occurs. Her initially unknown past helps her through the traumatic situation, but it's really her rather captivating backstory that grabbed my attention. It's fundamental to the understanding of the ending and Anya does a terrific job. I also want to give a small praise to Betty Buckley for a beautiful and necessary interpretation of Dr. Fletcher, a character that offers the audience some knowledge of Kevin's disease.As for the other two kidnapped girls, well ... They're my main issue with the film since they don't have a good reason to be there. Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) and Marcia (Jessica Sula) aren't the main characters, and they don't have that much screen time, but their dialogue still feels extremely forced and filled with a lot of nonsense. The ending of the story might not be as twisty as in other Shyamalan's installments, but I hope that people don't give up to false expectations. The classic Shyamalan's twisty ending isn't a necessary attribute of his movies, but the truth is that the twist is not the one you think it is. Once again, the note at the end of my review will clarify this.In the end, Split is Shyamalan's return to his old early 2000's self. Brilliantly unconventional storytelling, a lot of suspense, some very captivating subplots and a fantastic editing and production team behind him. The soundtrack plays a huge role in this film, as well as James McAvoy, who delivers his career-best performance. Anya Taylor-Joy is also pretty extraordinary, something that can't be said about her fellow friends who portrayed two bland characters. The ending brings the classic twist that makes everything more understandable, and I gotta say ... I love this film, and it is one of 2017's best!MAJOR SPOILER BELOWAs I said above, the soundtrack plays a huge role in the ending twist. That's because the soundtrack that plays right before the title of the movie appears on the screen, is the same one as in the third act of Unbreakable.This is one of the many clues throughout the film that hint at the idea that Split belongs to Unbreakable's universe. Naturally, after the title shows up, there's a scene with David Dunn (Bruce Willis) that confirms this theory, but these are little details that make Shyamalan into a great director and screenwriter. Also, it's a pity that I've only watched these movies after Shyamalan stating that they were part of an eventual trilogy. Not that I was not surprised at the end of Split, but it did remove that first impact of pure shock in knowing that two films separated by 17 years (in real life) are part of the same universe.Both movies end up falling into the ""superhero"" genre. Unbreakable is the story of our ""hero"" who spent his whole life sad because he wasn't doing ""what he was supposed to do"", and Split is an origin story of our ""villain"". If Glass delivers, this might be one of the best ""superhero"" trilogies ever.","

"16","Foolish","18 May 2018","After watching this movie, I have to say, I don't understand all the one and two star reviews. This is a return to form for the director of the excellent SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. I haven't enjoyed most of his output since those first two films, but only titles like his misguided LAST AIRBENDER and the truly terrible THE HAPPENING are deserving of such low marks. I've seen a few real one star movies, and SPLIT isn't one of them. It's definitely worthy of higher marks. I can only assume those who didn't like it are trying to lower the average rather than rank it realistically somewhere closer to 4 or 5 stars (although I'd rank it higher).It's a lot of fun. James MacAvoy is great in a subgenre that is normally pretty insipid (ie dissociative identity disorder movies). He deliveres a great performance that really helps to carry this film, and Betty Buckley also gives a notably outstanding performance in her supporting role.Is it as good as THE SIXTH SENSE? No. Is it worth seeing? Absolutely. I'd happily see it again.As for those reviewers who are upset that movies like this distort the public perceptions about mental illness, I can only assume they are too close to that subject to be truly objective.","

"17","TheLittleSongbird","4 February 2017","As said in my recent review for 'The Visit', M Night Shyamalan is one inconsistent director, with films that have fallen on both extreme sides of the film spectrum. The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender', 'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.'Split' now replaces 'The Visit' as Shyamalan's best film since 'The Village. Neither were perfect films or were to me the returns to form often touted, both with many great things which made it more frustrating that they also had flaws big enough to stop them from living to full potential. Ranking 'Split' with the rest of the films, it's for me one of his better ones (while 'The Visit' is somewhere in the middle), not a patch on 'Unbreakable' and especially 'The Sixth Sense' but certainly better than all his previous films post-'The Village' (and that is saying volumes, due to that the least bad of his ""panned"" films 'Lady in the Water' was still poor).The best thing about 'Split' is the performance of James McAvoy, who has never been creepier on film and it is a side that is just startling to watch. He has a very difficult role here, with 20+ very contrasting personalities sometimes having to change without warning quite violently and absolutely nails it in a way that one wouldn't think would expect from him. Anya Taylor Joy is more than up to his level in an enigmatic turn that combines shock, spunk and pathos. As is Betty Buckley in a sympathetic role that she does a lot with.Production design, lighting and effects have a real eeriness that adds hugely to the atmosphere, while the cinematography is significantly better than it was in 'The Visit', having an audacious and atmospheric professionalism and not done with a technique that will alienate (and has alienated) many. The music is suitably eerie, and Shyamalan does direct more than competently in building on the scares and tension.Apart from an ever so slightly dull beginning, much of the film up to the last half an hour is genuinely scary and suspenseful, with many twisty suspenseful turns, a sense of fun, frightening chills and contortions enough to bend the mind, more than delivering on the horror and psychological thriller elements.However, the last half an hour does disappoint, with a revelation that while certainly not obvious (far from it, actually very much unexpected) is revealed prematurely still which does hurt the momentum and tension, horror and suspense is replaced by head-scratching confusion (in the execution that is because it did feel muddled and under-explained) and behaviours and decisions that will induce groans of frustration. Unfortunately that last personality was as far from realistic or properly scary as one could possibly get (not McAvoy's fault at all, actually he did give the needed creepiness, but what he was given which was goofy), coming over as pretty silly actually and that jarred.Writing could have been much better, with a better and less awkward flow, the dialogue could have been less clunky and forced as well as less sloppily melodramatic. The victims also were written very lazily, constantly making stupid and illogical decisions that makes one frustrated at them rather than rooting for them.On the whole, fairly split here. A lot of great merits but could have been better. Still one of Shyamalan's better films, just not enough to make me proclaim ""he's back!"" 6/10 Bethany Cox","

"18","zardoz-13","6 February 2017","If tour-de-force performances alone constituted great cinema, then ""Sixth Sense"" writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"" would rate as one of the best. Instead, Shyamalan's twelfth movie boils down to a straightforward, low-budget, abduction thriller, with a cannibalistic serial killer. The difference is this serial killer is a colorful basket case, a character teeming with more identities than you can count on all fingers and toes. As the traumatized casualty of an abusive mom, woebegone protagonist Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy of ""Victor Frankenstein"") has forged a 'horde' of personalities to serve as a bulwark against the atrocity of real-life. Predictable, derivative, and sometimes preposterous, ""Split"" benefits largely from McAvoy's nuanced performance as well as Shyamalan's usual last-minute surprises. ""Split"" feels like an 'origins' film. Not only is the protagonist a villain, but he also remains at large. The heroine is one of his hostages. Naturally, McAvoy has a field day chewing the scenery as a wacko with 23 personalities who is gestating number twenty-four. Basically, this charming but deranged ding-a-ling abducts three pretty little things from a Philadelphia shopping mall and confines them for his own culinary delight in an underground facility from which escape is virtually impossible. Compared with other movies about split-personality psychos, ""Split"" features a wackadoodle serial killer who isn't presented as a maniac out of a Rob Zombie splatter film. McAvoy's chameleon-like capacity to shift from one identity to another in the wink of an eye is as fluid as if he were genuinely conflicted himself. Suffice to say, McAvoy is nothing short of brilliant as Kevin Wendell Crumb. Were it not for one of the three captives, ""Split"" would have probably focused entirely on Kevin and not been as dramatic. Casey Cook is one of the kidnapped girls, but she is nothing like the other girls. Unfortunately, we see only eight of the twenty-three fruitcakes that McAvoy portrays, but none is either demonic or original. Meanwhile, two of those four other characters lack sympathy because they brought this tragedy on themselves by ridiculing this psycho. What ""Split"" does better than anything else is create a strong, memorable villain, and McAvoy fleshes it out in a bravura performance. Shyamalan conjures up a modicum of suspense toward the end when the girls try desperately to escape. Sometimes, this above-average suspense proves aggravating because you realize how futile it is for these doomed characters to survive.Like Kevin, Casey Cook (Anya Taylor-Joy of ""The Witch"") has been forged in the crucible of child abuse, too. A heart attack killed her father (Sebastian Arcelus of ""Ted 2"") while she was attending elementary school. Sadly, her father's brother, Uncle John (Brad William Henke of ""Fury""), became Casey's guardian. Without divulging too much information, Casey and her stepfather have had an abusive relationship. Now, in high school, Casey prefers to keep to herself. Two of her snobbish classmates, Claire (Haley Lu Richardson of ""The Edge of Seventeen"") and Claire's African-American friend Marcia (Jessica of ""Honeytrap""), invite her to their birthday party more out of pressure rather than friendship. Indeed, they harbor cynical attitudes about Casey, but they fear the social media repercussions about what they might have faced had they not invited Casey. When her ride doesn't materialize, Casey agrees to accompany Claire and Marcia and listen to Claire's father (Brian Gildea) who loves to tell terrible jokes. As the saying goes, Hell is a road paved with good intentions, and Claire and Marcia have provided the asphalt that puts Casey in harm's way. Before they can pull out of the parking lot, a total stranger, Kevin Wendell Crumb, dispenses with Claire's dad and then carjacks them. Slipping on a face mask, he sprays something in their eyes that plunges them into oblivion. Of course, had they not been paralyzed with fear, these girls could have fled before Kevin incapacitated them. When they awaken, the girls find themselves locked up in a room with the same tight-lipped stranger staring at them. Eventually, they discover something is seriously amiss with their captor. Every time Crumb appears, he masquerades as an entirely different individual, sometimes even as a woman. What the three girls don't realize is that Kevin is a patient of a world-renowned psychotherapist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley of ""Frantic""), who has terribly misjudged the threat that he poses to society. Repeatedly, Kevin warns her about 'the beast' and how this Messianic personality will shield all twenty-three personalities from scorn and ridicule. When 'the beast' shows up, ""Split"" turns into a warped Marvel Comics movie because this side of Kevin possesses supernatural characteristics.Basically, ""Split"" is a standard-issue serial killer saga. Neither the police nor the FBI interfere in ""Split,"" which differentiates it from movies like ""Manhunter."" Shyamalan confines the action primarily to several underground rooms and one in a luxurious apartment. Shyamalan fashions some mildly suspenseful scenes, especially when the girls try to break out in the end. When the time comes for him to depict death, Shyamalan doesn't indulge himself as Eli Roth of ""Hostel"" infamy might. Nevertheless, the action amounts to a predictable series of episodic encounters between McAvoy's various personalities and his victims. Aside from Kevin Wendell Crumb, Casey qualifies as the only other genuinely interesting character. The two snobbish girls might as well have been mannequins. They are expendable, and they behave like whiny victims in a movie where whiny victims die. Most of Shyamalan's surprises occur exactly when you expect them, though two deserve back-to-back ""WOWS!"" because they come both as a relief and surprise! The outcome of Casey's hostile clash with 'the Beast' salvages this otherwise predictable potboiler. Bruce Willis's cameo in the final scene as security guard David Dunn brings ""Split"" into the ""Unbreakable"" timeline. Moreover, two characters at a diner compare Crumb to Glass! Ultimately, Shyamalan wants moviegoers to see James McAvoy's conflicted serial killer in ""Split"" in the same light as Alfred Hitchcock's classic chiller ""Psycho"" with Anthony Perkins as the protagonist.","

"19","Quinoa1984","27 January 2017","Split is a film that asks you to suspend your disbelief, and at first, even after the many films that this director has done where he goes way too far, I was with Split for about the first half of the way through, or maybe more. I knew logically this is not how DID works (Disassociative Identity Disorder), but hey, it's a movie, let's go with it. And to Shyamalan's credit, he casts the two major parts to the point where it's key and it works. And as a director, overall, and in large part thanks to the cinematographer behind It Follows, it's a film directed with real terror and suspense. It's low-budget, largely a 'bottle' film, and he uses his money with true style. It's paced well... where was I (now I feel like I got this disorder and will become two different critics here, gotta control...)Oh, yeah, James McAvoy, he's fantastic. He may not be playing 23 personalities in total, but the ones that Shyamalan focuses on are developed enough - among them is Barry (a gay fashion designer that McAvoy sort of plays like a young Pacino or something, in the physicality), Dennis (the one who may seem to be in 'control' and is extremely OCD about any dirt) and Hedwig (who is nine years old, and you can tell) - give McAvoy enough room to explore these personalities. There's times of awkward laughter at first, but this gives way to seeing that McAvoy is so committed to these characters, and is pulling them all of with intensity and charm and disbelief and a madness that is kind of similar to them all, that he's impossible to dislike.Another key player is Ana Taylor Joy, as she's the one of the three girls that we get to know the most (though with this we get into something of a, for me, forced motivation, but I'll get to that later), and she is on for all of these interactions with McAvoy. She's the one who can somehow speak to Hedwig sympathetically and connect with him, and when she is freaking out and trying to hold things inside, she does this perfectly. Between this and The VVitch she is really on a roll as a major actress for thrillers - she can play terrified, but being in control and being bad-ass works as well. And for a lot of the scenes the actress playing the psychiatrist, Betty Buckley, is believable, as far as she can take the lines to...Okay, here's where we get into the DID here with this movie in reality, it's with its writer AND then also its director. I don't mean the same person, I mean they are separate entities. Shyamalan the director is on top of his game here, with a formal rigor that hasn't clicked this week in well over a decade (it may even connect to Unbreakable, which... oh, more on that at the end of this). Shyamalan the *writer* is something else. He's still someone who thinks he's oh, so, so clever, and you know what? For that first half or so, he kind of is. At least, again, when it comes to the suspension-of-disbelief factor. He does a more than competent job of giving us a believable enough set-up with these girls being held captive, Barry putting up his false front when emailing but then denying anything is wrong to the doctor, and then how the personalities have their splits with the girls and how they are trying (unsuccessfully to escape)... but then Shyamalan the writer gets greedy. Or insane. Or both.The biggest problem here is that this man is CHEATING by the end of this, and in a way that is baffling. He can't have enough with having this somewhat preposterous thriller about a man juggling all these personalities that may lead up to ""The Beast"", the 24th personality. No, it needs to be deeper than that. It also needs to involve child molestation - not just with this man, but the Ana Taylor Joy character when she was younger - and that this, uh, maybe leads into having these super DID powers(!?) He's creating a whacked-out mythology where one needn't exist, and by the time the third act takes off, and you can mark it as soon as the Buckley character comes to Barry/Dennis/Hedwig/Patricia/Et-Al's basement dwelling, it fully goes into bananas territory.I know, I know, it's a thriller, I know I should keep buying into what this is selling... but I just couldn't. Most of all (oh, hell, you got this far in this review) it's the gall to turn this around to make this as part of a, uh, Shyamalan Cinematic Universe with a Bruce Willis Unbreakable cameo that brings me into the 'you're cheating!' territory. Perhaps this is simply this man's M.O. as far as crafting his material, that he can see ahead and know that this is what he has to do, and that everything ties together... or he wrote himself into a corner, realized he was writing sheer insanity as far as where McAvoy goes in this final third, and had to cover up. Either way, it might work for you... or it may feel like him f***ing with all of us. At any rate, all of the material with The Beast has the sensation of Shyamalan as mad mainstream provocateur, like 'hey, how far can I actually take this stuff, you've come this far right, eh, right? RIGHT?!' To his credit, this is a more enjoyable piece of madness than The Village, and its final third makes it something I want to revisit simply to show friends in a 'Look upon this wonder in awe' way like The Happening. I think among the Shyamalan *bad* movies, and this is bad make no mistake, it's directed like a pro and the actors are all on their game, and becomes the best of them.","

"20","freshclean-66-318608","6 July 2017","When this film made it's first debut I was hesitant on seeing it because I thought M. Night Shyamalan had lost his touch a bit but right when I thought everything was over for M. Night being one of my favorite directors/producers I just up and decided to give him one more chance with ""Split"" and I'm so glad I did. This was classic M. Night all the way from the twists and the unpredictable story-line to the scares and the edge of your seat thrills. This is just a great horror/thriller played out as a far fetched psychological thriller. It's well written and the plot is laid out perfectly to the end and If you like older M. Night films you will definitely enjoy this one.","

"21","kosmasp","22 June 2017","Splitting hairs is nothing compared to this. Of course Split refers to our main character. Although M. Night has had some diverse reactions on his last outputs. But mostly people did like this and it almost seems like he made a comeback. If you thought he vanished that is of course. The script is tight and the movie has a lot of memorable moments (most of them being weird), although one of the biggest can be seen in the trailer, which is unfortunate.There's also another scene where M.Night can be seen. His Hitchcock moment as some call it (I think he himself too). Letthis argument not spoil the fun you may be having with this one. The overall acting is good (apart from the one cameo I just mentioned, which is cringe-worthy) and the tension is there until the end. And after it, because there is a stinger in the credits ... a nice one at that too!","

But it wasn't until we started to watch it that I knew Shyamalan directed this one!Shyamalan is back! With this movie, he proves he managed to prove us he rediscovered his mojo that he had when we were introduced to 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable' and... Hack: I even loved 'Signs'!His movies from 'The Village' and on were very disappointing. But 'Split' is good old fashion M.-work.James McAvoy does an amazing job and shows us that not only Edward Norton can play these kind of degenerated characters. Ans the ending with Bruce Willis... It made me feel super... Unbreakable even ;-)Love it man! Haters just have no idea what film making is about...","

"23","parry_na","2 February 2017","Two smartphone distracted girls and their 'weird' friend are kidnapped by an unknown assailant who carries out the action without any emotion whatsoever.'Barry' is a model employee. He's been ill, but is better now. Doctor Fletcher (Betty Buckley) says this. We learn of 'Barry's' disorder because Fletcher is trying to widen awareness for his condition. The information about what is known as 'DID' is staggered throughout, at length, and her scenes are interspersed with 'Barry' and his other personalities presenting themselves to his three prisoners. One of these is an upper-class woman called 'Patricia', another is an irritant called 'Hedwig', another is a nuisance called 'Dennis' (who likes to watch girls dance naked). In reality, his name is Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), and he has 23 personalities.Despite claims that, for example, if one personality is a weight-lifter he possesses the strength of a weight-lifter whilst other shared personalities do not, McAvey doesn't have the physical presence to portray anyone that couldn't just be over-powered by the three girls – or even just one of them (with a more sustained battering than just hitting him once and then turning their back on him, something that happens more than once). Despite the theatrical rolling eyes, the lisp, the change of clothes, he simply isn't frightening. His endless talking about himself makes it clear that his characters are a lot more interesting to him than to the audience – or at least, this member of it. I can appreciate a committed performance, but sadly he leaves me cold.Perhaps to balance out Kevin's multiple characteristics, the three girls have only one personality between them. Being the allegedly 'weird' one of the trio, it is Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who had been so good in 2015's 'The Witch') to whom 'Dennis' is attracted, because of course weirdness is an elite exclusive club that joins every outsider together, provided you're pretty enough ('the broken are the more evolved,' apparently). Luckily for flesh fans, one of Kevin's personalities suffers from OCD, necessitating the young captives to remove much of their 'dirty' clothing. Another box ticked.There have been accusations that 'Split' is offensive to sufferers of mental health disorders. In an age where being offended is a competitive sport, presumably any piece of fiction involving death, for instance, is offensive to anyone who has ever suffered bereavement and therefore 'shouldn't be allowed'. This is a point of view that stifles creativity, fiction, drama and/or many levels of art. That is not the problem with 'Split' in my view. It is an idea that is ripe with potential but simply stretched out very thinly over almost two hours with very little incident. In fact, the kidnapping of three girls is the only incident. Endless scenes of talking about 'Barry's' condition isn't entertaining, frightening or effecting. It very quickly becomes dull and stays that way.Director M. Night Shyamalan had a great success with 'The Sixth Sense' in 1999, especially its twist ending. Subsequently, all his films have ended with a similar surprise, each one less effective than the last. If you make it to the end of this, there is a revelation that (SPOILERS) Kevin's affliction appears to be supernatural. 'The Beast' is physically bulkier than his other personalities, can hop from wall to wall and is impervious to bullets. This ends with a reference to Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' via a Bruce Willis cameo which pre-supposes you are on familiar terms with that film, which is presumptuous, as this is not billed as a sequel.","

"25","trublu215","12 January 2017","M. Night Shyamalan's Split pits a ground of teenage girls against their captor (James McAvoy) and his plethora of multiple personalities with each personality ranging from harmless to deadly. First off, I want to say, I did enjoy the first hour or so of this film. It was creepy, tense, tasteless but fun. Then the final hour comes steam rolling everything in its wake including all the thought and caring that we've grown to have over the course of the previous hour. It is not one thing or another, it's a willingness to halt the film's growth as it's own and by the final minute of the film, everyone will know what I am talking about. As for spoilers, I'm not going to spoiling anything which makes my thoughts that much harder to gather. While I'm not a complete film snob, I do expect certain things going into an M. Night Shyamalan film. If you were talking to me before The Village, I'd say that I would expect a creepy atmospheric film. If you're asking me post-Village, I'd simply say ""Dear God, I hope it's good."" The Visit was somewhat back on track for him so I was excited to see this but instead I'm leaving this film actually giving up hope. The twist is so lazy and so out-of-left- field that it diminishes any sort of weight. It is merely a gimmick rather than a clever little twist, especially for a Shyamalan film. Honestly, it single handily ruined the film for me. It is a singular moment that completely drains Split of any real merit as a standalone film.Like I said, James McAvoy gives a chilling performance that sometimes goes over-the-top but still maintains a level of creepiness without it ever being overbearing. Anya Taylor-Joy gives a very good performance as well as Casey, who gives a better performance here than in last year's terrifying yet overrated The Witch. The rest of the cast plays out the typical female horror characters to a fault and actually fails to breathe new life in a very tiring role.Overall, Split is a film that could have cut out it's so-called ""twist"" and been a fun midnight movie, a solid 7/10. But instead M. Night Shyamalan delivers his laziest twist to date in hopes of continuing the trend that is a M. Night Shyamalan film. A term that used to mean something, now is played out to a gimmicky effect and we all know Shyamalan is so much better than that. And while I'm sure the ""twist"" will wet some hardcore fans' appetite, it made the film that much more trivialized.","
