"1","Sleepin_Dragon","23 September 2019","Jessica Rothe shines through in this tongue in cheek horror. It's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, the characters, means of death, and outlandish humour move it into the horror comedy genre.I loved the reference to Groundhog Day at the end of the film, I would imagine there was some sort of in joke there, and of course any film that involves the loop storyline will have reference to the great Bill Murray film.There were some great twists and turns, the best one coming at the end. This was very enjoyable. 7/10","

"2","Top_Dawg_Critic","23 October 2017","This type of movie has been done many times before and rarely succeeds, but this one was a hit for me! Jessica Rothe's performance is what kept me interested... she nailed her character and was convincing and funny as well.I don't want to give too much away, but the twists towards the end were a nice surprise and earned a few extra points from me.It's classified as a Horror, Mystery, Thriller but it's also a comedy as I found myself laughing a bunch of times.Certainly a must-see entertaining film produced and executed very well, much better than many other films in this genre.It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.","

"3","TheLittleSongbird","2 November 2017","Saw 'Happy Death Day' as somebody who was fascinated by the concept, found the advertising interesting and good enough to warrant a view and who appreciates horror when done well. Seeing it just before Halloween as part of my Halloween celebrations, will admit to not being as bowled over by the film as would have liked but enjoying it a good deal.As surprisingly interesting as the advertising was (and there has been some dreadful advertising this year, a notable recent example being the completely mis-marketed 'Geostorm'), it is also misleading. One would expect a truly frightening film judging from the trailers, but actually 'Happy Death Day' happened to be much more than what was indicated and wasn't what one would call terrifying or sleep-with-the-light-on-for-a-week. The good news is that 'Happy Death Day' actually makes the most of its concept, refreshing having seen films recently that had concepts that they didn't do anywhere near enough with. The not so good news is that as enjoyable as it was it did feel like something was missing.It is easy to see why lots of people will like, and have liked 'Happy Death Day'. It is just as easy to see why it will be, and has been, a let-down for others. My opinion has shades of both, leaning towards the former. 'Happy Death Day' may be somewhat standard (while the concept is a pretty unique one, some of the story elements aren't), superficial (other than the lead character, the characters are developed very flimsily) and some parts don't make as much sense as they could and feel unfinished.Was expecting more from the killer twist reveal, which is not as clever and surprising as one would like and the whole ending felt rather silly and rushed to me (the killer's motive also came over as really trivial for an elaborate set-up). A little slow to begin with too, it's once the concept kicks in when 'Happy Death Day' properly comes to life and maintains that energy for the rest of the film.For all those faults though, 'Happy Death Day' is also refreshingly self-aware, almost very much aware of its standard-ness and superficiality and acknowledges it, and manages to be lots of fun, creepy-suspenseful and surprisingly thought-provoking. Gruesomely funny sums it up very well.'Happy Death Day' is a long way from amateurish visually, the photography is stylish rather than slapdash, the editing has suitably unnerving moments and the lighting is atmospheric. Christopher Landon never lets it get too heavy while not diluting the fun or scares, and the at times haunting and at others times funky soundtrack adds a lot.When it comes to the script, 'Happy Death Day' is full of knowing humour and never removes its tongue from its cheek, instead keeping it firmly intact throughout which proved to come off really well. It also really makes one think. The story execution is not perfect, but it's never dull and has some neat twists and turns that stops it from being predictable and repetitive.Jessica Rothe should become a bigger star after her excellent lead turn here, she has been acting a few years before this but this is the first time where she really held my attention and allowed me to take proper notice of her. Israel Broussard is also very believable and the two have great chemistry together. The acting on the whole is solid but essentially it's all about Rothe and she is one of the main reasons why 'Happy Death Day' is worth a viewing.Overall, a long way from perfect but quite enjoyable. 6/10 Bethany Cox","

"4","moonspinner55","23 October 2017","Jessica Rothe is amusingly pithy and savvy playing a selfish college beauty, a spoiled sorority sister who rules the school until she is stabbed and killed on her way to a surprise birthday party by a masked lunatic. But fate plays this campus cutie an unusual hand once she discovers she's living her birthday over and over again, each time attempting to cheat death but always running into her attacker. Screenwriter Scott Lobdell isn't trying to sneak a slasher variant of ""Groundhog Day"" passed us--he's upfront about the similarities, even exalts in them, while toying with all the possibilities such a scenario can offer. It takes Rothe three tries to fully comprehend what's happening to her; once she formulates a plan (creating a suspect list), Lobdell mixes things up, so that the movie rarely feels repetitive. Our heroine, snarky to start, follows Bill Murray's example and becomes a better person on her twisted journey (reestablishing contact with her father, apologizing to her roommate, even causing her own demise on one occasion to prevent the cute nerd from the boys' dorm from losing his life). Director Christopher B. Landon deserves credit for delivering a modern-day thriller with lots of action but no gore and no nudity. If it isn't quite a family-friendly slasher flick, it certainly is a squirrelly, sassy one, with some big laughs counterbalancing the suspense. Good show! *** from ****","

"5","claudio_carvalho","1 November 2018","On the day of her birthday, the college student Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) awakes in the male dormitory on the bed of Carter Davis (Israel Broussard). She learns that she was totally wasted in the previous night and she leaves Carter to meet her snobish Kappa friends. Then she despises Carter that brings her bracelet that was forgotten in his room; ignores the calls of her father that wants to have lunch with her; visits the office of her professor Gregory Butler (Charles Aitken), who is married and is having an affair with her; and despises her roommate Lori Spengler (Ruby Modine) that gives a cupcake to her. During the night, Tree goes to a party at the Sigma house but is murdered by a hooded masked man while crossing a tunnel. Out of the blue, Tree wakes up on her birthday day on the bed of Carter and relives the day, when she tries to find who might be the killer.""Happy Death Day"" is a surprisingly good film, with the combination of horror, romantic comedy, mystery and thriller genres. The most important is the humor and Jessica Rothe´s performance is great in the role of the cynical Tree Gelbman. There are jokes also with ""Groundhog Day"" and teenage slashers and campus movies that work very well. Her list of suspects is hilarious and the dark humor of the alternate ending is a plus of the DVD. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Morte Te Dá Parabéns"" (""The Death Gives Happy Birthday"")Note: On 15 April 2023, I saw this film again.","

"7","Platypuschow","21 February 2019","I've been looking forward to this ever since I saw the teaser trailer, sadly it's taken me this long to get around to it.So did it live up to expectations? Not entirely, but I walked away happy regardless.For those unaware it's Groundhog Day (1993) with murder as we see a girl repeatedly being killed off only to start to day anew. Personally I loved this idea and was curious with where they were going to go with it.The traditional slasher tropes are all present, some great dark humor is in the script and the cast are all on point. Notable especially is our leading lady Jessica Rothe who was excellent though I spent half the movie baffled by just how much she looks like Melissa Benoist.I'm not sure the finale was up to the same quality as the rest of the film and that is perhaps why it's receiving a 7 not an 8. Something about it just felt inferior and saw the movie go out with a bit of a fizzle.Regardless I can see why the film was so successful, congratulations to everyone involved because though I didn't find it as mind blowing as I'd hoped I can't deny that this is a very inventive fun little film.The Good:Jessica RotheCast are all greatFantastic conceptSome great ideasThe Bad:Weak soundtrack for a movie of this ilkFinale was underwhelmingHearing the same dialogue repeatedly can get frustrating","

"8","kevschwaller","7 October 2017","I saw a pre-screening of Happy Death Day and let me tell you, it was one of the most fun theater experiences I've had. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is definitely for the best. If anyone walks into a movie about a sorority girl living the same day over and over and being killed over and over and expects it to be some genre-defying horror perfection, that's on them. However, that doesn't mean this is a bad movie by any means. Jessica Rothe as Tree Gelbman and Israel Broussard as Carter Davis are fantastic as the two leads. They have excellent chemistry and make us root for them. Rothe's character wasn't the typical horror movie sorority girl, either. She was cunning and badass. She made us believe she could actually figure this mess out. If you don't change your mind on who the killer is at least twice throughout the film, you aren't paying attention.There are curveballs thrown left and right, which made my theater gasp and yell numerous times. You think the movie is about to end on at least two different occasions. The script is smart, there's horror, there's comedy, there's drama. Happy Death Day takes you in numerous directions, while also making sure you have fun along the way. This is definitely one of my all-time favorite campy horror flicks out there. It even pokes fun at Groundhog Day, which it very clearly took some inspiration from. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror; again, it doesn't redefine the genre and there are definitely an abundance of clichés. With that, though, there are still a handful of clever moments I certainly was not expecting.","

"10","stevencvgarcia","14 October 2017","I think people going to see this movie are expecting wayyyy to much from a slasher movie. I'm rating it based on what I expected, and I was certainly impressed. This movie wasn't trying to be anything more than another murder movie, but what made me want to see it was the idea of taking Groundhog Day (which it fully admitted to ripping the idea from) and turning it into a slasher film. I was actually surprised it held back on gore and blood. I was fully expecting it to be all the tropes of gross-out killings, but it was instead focused more on character development and the story. I admit the characters are a bit one-dimensional, but again, it's a slasher movie. It's trying to win any academy awards here. In many ways I think it's parodying those one-dimensional characters of college trope characters and the ""last girl"" in horror movies because it goes all-in on establishing the main characters as somebody you're meant to hate at first. The ending genuinely took me in a direction I didn't anticipate, and then it took me back to what I was expecting, but did it in a way that I felt fresh. All in all, I had fun watching this movie, which I think what this movie was meant to be: Fun.","

"11","CANpatbuck3664","14 October 2017","Every negative review for this movie is going to point out that this movie is built around a concept that we've seen before. Our protagonist is forced to live through the same day again and again. Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow (both excellent movies) made this idea popular and for some people, they won't be able to get past the fact that this isn't brand new gimmick. I don't have a problem if movies borrow from other movies, they just need to do it effectively and put a fresh spin on it. Happy Death Day certainly accomplishes that. At the beginning, the journey hits the first couple of familiar notes but when Tree starts to realize what's happening, that's when the movie shifts gears. They aren't afraid to play with Tree's tragic end day after day and the movie functions for whole periods as a straight comedy. Luckily, this movie is really funny when it wants to be. The writers know enough to play with certain genre clichés and there's a surprising amount of tongue-in-cheek humour here. The marketing for this is a little misleading, it makes this movie look like a traditional slasher movie when it really ends up being a mishmash of comedy, mystery and horrorOther than the living the same day plot point, Happy Death Day centres around the mystery of who Tree's killer is. The movie throws a bunch of obvious red herrings at you right off the bat and I was glad they took it a less obvious direction. I don't think they overplay their hand either, there are a couple of hints here and there but I think you'd have to be pretty perceptive to guess the twists and turns that Day's plot takes. If I had one complaint, there was a point where they looked like they were heading towards a very sentimental resolution that could have been corny. Its a case of me wanting that for these characters. They bypass that though and keep going and while I understand the decision, I might have preferred that wrap-up instead.Another turnoff for certain audience members might be Tree's personality as a character. She's a real b!#@% when we first meet her and I'm not exaggerating. The first time she meets her killer, I wasn't feeling sorry for her. But even when she's at her worst, she still has a certain charisma that you want to keep rooting for her. Writing characters that aren't perfect and are selfish that you want to follow is an art that so many horror movies get wrong. I liked how Tree grows (no pun intended) and by the end I really wanted her to find a happy ending somehow.I don't often get to really discover actors and actresses. Most of the movies I watch are pretty mainstream and by the time someone becomes a lead, you've probably heard about them from somewhere. I wasn't familiar with Jessica Rothe at all but she anchored this movie as Tree. This is a stand up and take notice kind of performance, she's multi-faceted in handling both the drama and the comedy in this movie. I hope this movie is just a stepping stone to bigger things for her and I think the last time I walked away from a movie so impressed with an actress I didn't know was Margot Robbie in The Wolf of Wall Street. Israel Broussard is easy to like as Carter, he's easy going enough that his character's relationship with Tree builds up organically. Rachel Matthews is funny as Danielle Bouseman, she's playing a very stereotypical character (stuck up sorority rich girl) but she nails it. Ruby Modine is sweet as Lori and Charles Aitken is appropriately slimy as Gregory Butler,I couldn't believe how charmed I was by this movie. I didn't plan on going to see this, it was a very spur of the moment thing and walking out of the theatre I was blown away. Happy Death Day isn't the best movie I've seen this year but its the biggest movie-going surprise of the year for me. It features a great turn from an up and coming actress, a good mystery, some well placed meta humour and a willingness to play within its central conceit. The marketing for this movie doesn't show how creative and fun it is and I would urge you to give this a shot. We've come off the summer blockbusters and we're still too early for the awards contenders so if you're looking for something to check out, Happy Death Day is an extremely fun hour and a half at the movies. Also, make sure to show up on time, there's a gag pulled with the opening credits that hints at what's to come.","

"13","Padreviews","23 October 2017","I had low expectations and I have to say they were totally exceeded . This is an enjoyable Romantic Horror with more than a passing reference to GROUNDHOG DAY - and the occasional reminiscing of the 15 year old Shaun of the dead . Plus a bit of Scream , scary movie and a number of other slasher movies . Jessica Roshe was brilliant in the starring role , you believe in her character , her charm was endearing and despite the 10 years between her character and actual age she played the combination of innocent romantic with a touch a modern feisty independent female in control of her own destiny . The only poor point was how the inevitable twist was handled - that could have been slightly better but definitely worth seeing . Pad.A 7/10","

"14","cardsrock","11 March 2020","Happy Death Day is fully aware of the kind of movie it is and has no qualms about poking fun at itself. It's this type of self-awareness and humor that makes the film enjoyable to watch. The film is somewhat original in putting a slasher spin on the great premise of Groundhog Day (although it is awfully similar to a classic episode of Supernatural...) and features an entertaining lead performance by Jessica Rothe.","

"15","SnoopyStyle","24 March 2018","Self-obsessed sorority girl Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) wakes up in a strange dorm room. She had spent the drunken night with Carter. She does the walk of shame home. Her roommate Lori gives her a birthday cupcake. She's having an affair with the married Dr. Gregory Butler. As night falls, she is killed by a masked perpetrator. She wakes up once again in the dorm room and it's a deadly Groundhog Day.It's a terrific little high-concept horror. Jessica Rothe is great. Everything is great until the second to last repeat day. Once she discovers the serial killer, the next day should be nothing but gearing up to take down the killer. Instead, she goes around fixing everything which is unnecessary. She should go buy a gun or at least pepper spray. I kept waiting for her to go to the hospital during that one bad day. It does have a nice twist and the movie isn't torpedoed by that one day. This movie is a fun little surprise.","

"16","cherold","3 October 2019","Terrifically fun comedy combines slasher movies with Groundhog's Day and a bit of a whodunit. The movie centers on a young, rather obnoxious sorority girl, caught in a time loop and hunted by a masked, knife-wielding killer, who searches for her killer while, in Groundhog tradition, becomes a better person.I'm not a fan of slasher films because I don't like gore, but this movie has no gore, which made me happy. It's not especially scary, but it does have a little suspense here and there. Mainly it's funny, ingenious, and likable.Overall the movie does a decent job of making sense, although twice near the end actions that certainly would have resulted in some trouble don't. Overall it's quite clever and well worth watching.","

"17","kluseba","24 November 2017","Happy Death Day tells the story of the condescending, dismissive and self-centred student Theresa who gets killed by a masked assailant on her birthday. However, she doesn't die and wakes up in the morning of the same day. Theresa quickly realizes that she must uncover her assailant's identity to survive her birthday and therefore break the curse of experiencing her own death over and over again. Along with a male acquaintance she spent the night with, she starts investigating her potential enemies, their motives and alibis. While doing so, Theresa realizes how her own flaws have let to this tragic situation and she attempts to become a better person.Happy Death Day is one of best horror movies in recent memory. Instead of focusing on gore and special effects, the film works with a desperate, gloomy and mysterious atmosphere and a few efficient jump scares. However, the film has much more going for it. It focuses on a stunning character development as a superficial, rude and egocentric teenage girl slowly becomes a profound, joyful and empathetic young woman. This film can be considered a coming-of-age drama and it's one of the best of its kind. As if those elements weren't enough, Happy Death Day also tells us an interesting love story that becomes more and more profound as the film progresses. It also deals with family and friendship issues in a dramatic way. To lighten things up, the movie also includes humorous parts which mostly consist of absurd situation comedy and a few quirky dialogues. However, this movie succeeds where films and franchises like Evil Dead and Scream have failed before: the humorous elements never take away from the sinister moments as Happy Death Day feels perfectly balanced. The movie is genuinely entertaining from start to finish and once it's over, you simply feel like watching this roller coaster ride again and embrace this movie's unique atmosphere. Some critics and viewers have slammed the movie for having a plot that borrows heavily from the concept of Groundhog Day. This is true but Happy Death Day is executed with so much energy and originality that it simply doesn't matter. Even if you are familiar with the concept, this film will still keep you guessing from start to finish. You probably won't see this movie's outcome coming either.In the end, Happy Death Day is among the very best movies of the year and massively exceeded my expectations. If you like clever horror and coming-of-age movies, you can't get around this film. Happy Death Day is best enjoyed around Halloween with your friends.","

"18","savagdog1","13 October 2017","When I saw the trailer for this movie I admit I rolled my eyes and groaned that they were trotting out the circular time gimmick again. It was of course classic in Groundhog Day, but never seemed to click since then. I was dubious, but after seeing it with my own eyes, I can say I had a great time. I'm not sure if Blum House intended it to be funny, but it had a lot of humor in it, enough I would say to qualify it as a dark comedy. The cast was superb and while it didn't offer anything groundbreaking in terms of murders/deaths, I didn't mind because the story was so well connected and it really had me guessing right up until the end. Another litmus test for the quality of this movie is that the audience was rather quiet during the presentation. I've been to enough of these films to know that when you get a young audience seated in the dark and the film is a snooze, they'll start to talk and whisper and just annoy the Hell out of you. This movie managed to hold the attention of the entire audience and in this day and age I must say, that is an achievement in and of itself. I wasn't prepared to enjoy Happy Death Day as much as I did, but even I can admit when I was wrong. It worked from start to finish. I wasn't aware that Scott Lobdell wrote the script, but when I saw his name in the credits, I realized another reason I enjoyed it. I am familiar with his writing in the comic book industry and he is one of the more notable scribes. It's good to see the skills transfer.","

"20","zkonedog","19 June 2018","There are some movies that try to create a sense of realism within them. There are other movies that lean into character/situational cliches to play for comedy or hijinks. Simply put, ""Happy Death Day"" squarely falls into the latter category. As such, your enjoyment of this film will likely come down to how much you can suspend disbelief at the over-the-top characters to dig into a plot that can actually be intriguing.For a basic plot summary, ""Happy Death Day"" focuses on the story of Tree (Jessica Rothe), a college student who wakes up one morning (her birthday, of all days) in the dorm room of Carter (Israel Broussard) after an apparent hook-up. Tree then goes about her ""normal"" routine, only to be stalked that night (on the way to a party) by a mysterious masked figure. When this figure stabs her and death looks certain...she once again wakes up in Carter's room. It is again her birthday, the date is the same, and the day repeats itself almost exactly the same. As such, the rest of the film entails Tree's struggle first to figure out what the heck is happening, and then finding ways to remedy it.In terms of plot, there are indeed some interesting things happening in ""Happy Death Day"". It is very reminiscent of ""Groundhog Day"" (even outright admitting that fact at one point!) and has a number of fake-outs that shake things up and keep it from being too predictable.Unfortunately (at least for viewers like myself), that plot intrigue is really just a front for a film made for teens heading to the multiplex on a Friday or Saturday night. As I mentioned in the opener, most of the characters are so over-the-top as to be cringe-worthy (at least for more ""seasoned"" film fans), an approach that will not phase younger viewers nearly as much. I watched the movie with a sibling 13 years my junior, and she loved it!I know that ""Happy Death Day"" was probably never meant to be anything more than it is, so that's why I won't drop it down under a middling 5/10 stars. At the same time, the trailers for the film are a bit misleading, as they connote a film that looks like a serious thriller with a time-loop component. You just have to know going in that this isn't exactly the case, as ""serious"" is far from the adjective I would use to ever describe the film.","

"22","matthewssilverhammer","20 October 2017","Happy Death Day comes from Blumhouse Productions, the studio made famous for the resurgence of horror in theaters (Get Out, The Purge, Insidious). However, this is the lightest of light thrills. Sure, it would fit in the slasher movie bin, but with its bubble gum aesthetics and goofy comedy, it's really more Freaky Friday than Friday the 13th. And in that sense, it's mildly charmingif not bright enough to be great. For starters, the premise is pretty stupid, and the execution of that premise isn't much better. A brash and awful sorority girl is forced to relive the same birthday over and over, each one ending in her own murder by a masked killer. Imagine Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow, but in the teen-screams genre and with a lot less complexity. In fact, most of its ""originality"" just comes in its blanket theft from other properties and throwing them all together: the youth world of Mean Girls; the comedy of ""Scream Queens""; the protagonist from ""The Good Place""; the scares from The Purge. It's not bad, just familiar, like we're reliving this recognizable movie just as the character relives her day. Once our girl starts trying to solve the whodunit-mystery, things get more assured and fun, as we find it easier to root for her and her insistence on not dying each day ad infinitum. Even though the deaths and scares are wanting, the other elements work, especially the humor and (gasp!) the heart. It's harmless and forgettable October fare, made more for people who hate horror than me. In other words, my wife will love it.","

"23","rockman182","16 October 2017","The trailer for this film accompanied by 50 Cent's ""In Da Club"" looked  incredibly dumb, but that didn't mean that the film wasn't going to be  a stupid good time. These types of repetition of a certain day films  are somewhat popular with recent incarnations being completely  forgettable. Groundhog Day gets it right, and I was curious to see a  college slasher drama try to take a different spin on the idea.  The film is about Tree Gelbman, a typical short fused sorority girl who  loves to party and get drunk and her trials against a day that keeps  repeating. On her birthday she is murdered and the day keeps resetting  until she can figure out who her killer is. The daily death takes a  toll on her body and she gets physically weaker each time. its a tough  task having to try to figure things out when everything around her  resets and the killer and his/her motivations remain unknown.  Jessica Rothe was just perfect for this role. She's an attractive lead  who played the college girl role to a tee. Her character grows by the  end of the film and you start to feel a better connection with her as  she becomes a different human being when her constant death teaches her  about her own life. Other than that, there aren't really many fleshed  out or identifiable characters, which is fine. This is a cheap thriller  and should be treated a such, doesn't mean it isn't entertaining.  The repetition surprisingly doesn't overstay its welcome and keeps  itself fun. This film is barely a horror because its so stupid and the  film knows it. Its more of a comedy with killing than anything else.  Which is perfectly fine. The killer reveal is kind of obvious despite  the writers trying to twist you away from it. Overall, you won't have  much of an impression from this picture but it makes for a good time in  the cinema.  6.5/10","

"24","Zac_La_Porte","24 July 2022","This is the excessively fun horror-comedy version of Groundhog Day with a slasher twist. The popular concept where there's the spotlight on the main character who keeps on reliving the same day over and over again has been borrowed and reused so many times, one example being Edge of Tomorrow in 2014. Although that movie received positive criticism, a lot of films that take this concept will fail miserably, but Happy Death Day is not one of them.This killer-mystery horror-comedy features a worthy performance from Jessica Rothe, who the film introduces as a real jerk of a college girl. But if you wait for it, her snotty attitude improves and you begin to root for her as she's continuously being killed and must relive the day until she figures out her killer's identity. This makes for a very interesting idea, and alike Groundhog Day, although a lot of the same actions and lines are repeated throughout the movie, it just never gets boring and it's always fascinating to see the lead discovering that for themselves.Happy Death Day is also probably the best horror-comedy for teens seeking thrills and laughs, with there being an appropriate impact level of horror violence, an admirable amount of jokes and an unexpected plot twist many horror-mysteries are capable of but don't do. And despite this movie having a really light-hearted horror and a reasonably silly tone, it's as the lead's attitude and outlook starts to become nicer that there's a touching message that will possibly leave a lot of viewers thinking about how they can be a better person. It's another example of everything in this movie being a surprise.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"25","jtindahouse","16 October 2017","I'm starting to see a trend develop in modern horror movies (the good ones at least) and I really like it. Film makers are beginning to realise that for horror to work there has to be some different levels to the film. 90 minutes of watching people get killed isn't going to be able to cut it anymore. You have to be able to make the audience laugh, think and even move them emotionally. If you can do that then your film will be a success. Earlier this year 'Get Out' pulled it off and now 'Happy Death Day' has nailed it too.When the opening logos featured a joke (literally in the first few seconds of the film) I thought I may have misread the tone of the film in the trailers. Turns out I had, but in a good way. It wasn't an indication that the film was to be a laugh-fest, simply that it had that layer to it. And the thing about the layers that the film possesses it that every one of them works. Whatever it tries to pull off it manages.The twists and turns and how crafty it is about concealing them truly blew me away. At least three times I thought to myself such and such element would be better if they'd done so and so, only to later find out they did indeed have that up their sleeve the whole time. The film is incredibly smart.I can't say enough good things about this film. The trailers won't give a fair indication to people of what this film is truly capable of, and so sadly I fear many who would love it will not get around to seeing it. If you get the chance though please do see it. It's a fantastic film and you won't be disappointed.","
