"1","ThomDerd","22 October 2018","Venom is about the symbiotic relationship of man and alien, with the latter being the gross one. Funny at times, with a lovely performance from Tom Hardy -if you are a fan of mr Hardy, this is going to be entertaining for you.
First half goes very well in terms of setting the story and the venom universe, second part is more about action and there it has a few flaws but it is still fun and interesting to watch.
It is a cool view on the ""almost anti-hero"" venom/eddie character that kept my attention.
I had a good time watching this in the theaters and i ll definitely have a second view when it comes out in bray or dvd.
So, all in all its def not the best action film of all times or even of 2018...but dont have too high expectations and you will definitely like it.
8/10.","

The only thing I disagree with Martin Scorsese about is that ""Marvel movies are like theme park rides"" because there are ones like Endgame, Thor Ragnarok (my personal favourite Marvel movie), Civil War, The Avengers, Infinity War and many others that have a far deeper meaning and much more than just entertainment. Overall, Venom is one of those okay movies that doesn't deserve hate, the scenes where the Venom inside Tom Hardy's character is talking to him are pretty hilarious.73%","

"3","claudio_carvalho","2 December 2018","""Venom"" is a funny and entertaining film based on a Marvel antihero Venom with reasonable storyline, awesome special effects and weak and annoying villain performed by the awful Riz Ahmed. However, Tom Hardy has good performance in the role of the clumsy loser Eddie Brock and Michelle Williams complete the lead cast. This film is also the chance to see Stan Lee in his last cameo. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Venom""","

The effects are so good, Venom is a terrific creation, I loved the monologues, so good.I will visit the cinema for the second, this was great. 8/10.","

"6","TheLittleSongbird","17 October 2018","Do have a fondness for superhero films. 'Venom' also had talented people in the cast, Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams have both done great work in their careers, it looked interesting and found myself really fascinated to watch an origins story of one of the most interesting anti-heroes in the superhero universe.Watched 'Venom' with reasonably high expectations and with the willingness, as always, to judge the film for myself and form my own opinion. Was aware that it was not well liked by the critics, but part of me was really hoping to disagree with the thought that could a film with so much potential be worse than it actually looked? Have to agree with those that were left disappointed, while also not finding 'Venom' to be that bad. Am not though going to join in the irritatingly excessive critic bashing from people who really need to start learning the difference between fact and opinion.'Venom' does have good things. It is at its best in the scenes and chemistry between Eddie and Venom, which had fun and tension. It is when Venom arrives on screen too when the film properly starts to generate interest, after too long struggling to invest in the first act. The darker elements of the film are actually quite well done, having a dark grit and creepiness. It looks reasonably good, well designed and shot with slickness and atmosphere.The music has pleasant moments and fits well while there is some exciting action, especially the car chase sequence. Some of the effects are terrific. Tom Hardy is intensely charismatic, with Eddie/Venom being interesting and well contrasted characters, far more believable than Topher Grace in 'Spiderman 3'.However, the rest of the cast don't fare so greatly. Michelle Williams has never had a flatter character than here and is basically wasted in a development-free plot-device role. Riz Ahmed is far too anaemic for the one-dimensional villain that's both cartoonish and insipid. Of the characters, only Eddie and Venom engage and intrigue, the rest are flat. While some of the effects are terrific, others are terrible especially in the latter stages with the biggest offender being the rushed and clumsy climax.It is the script and story where 'Venom' fails most. The script is really clunky, especially with the forced and goofy humour that can be misplaced (Venom's disgust at taking the elevator was the one moment passing as funny) and the villain spouting dialogues and speeches that mean nothing. The less too about the soapy and cliché-ridden scenes featuring Hardy and Williams the better, they are bland and don't serve much point, and the Life Institute scenes should have had more clarity. Unfortunately, these scenes dominate the first act and makes it feel rather dull and ""taking too long to get going"". The story is tonally disjointed, too many tones that are very variable on their own and don't gel together, and very clunky. This is not a case of the film not trying, to me it came over as trying too hard in catering to everyone and throwing in too many ideas and elements and executing them very variably and too safely. For a story intended to be dark and violent, this seemed rather tame and held back.Summing up, a disappointment but not that bad. 5/10 Bethany Cox","

"7","kosmasp","2 May 2019","I get it, even the people who may already hit the not helpful button, before reading this. You see my rating and go: ""no way"". And I get it in the sense, that I haven't read the comics as much as many people who were expecting and hoping this would go ""R""-rated. Of course this stretches the boundaries of PG-13, because it is quite violent. But it will never be enough from what I heard from people who know the comics.So if that is something that is dear to your heart, again I get it. If you are just here to enjoy a comic book movie, there is quite a lot to enjoy. Tom Hardy really cherishes in his mania. Enjoy the Mayhem even if there was a sort of better ""inside voice"" movie last year called ""Upgrade"". So yes, if you only watch one of those make it Upgrade. But if you don't mind watching another, watch this too, because it ain't half bad","

Coming out of this movie makes me want to have a symbiote latch onto me if it's anything like the film. I loved the movie from end to finish, it was a hilarious, fun filled action ride!My only critic is I would have liked the finale to go on for a little longer but other than that I thought it was brilliant, I deffo reccomend everyone go see it.DONT Listen to other people's reviews, go watch it for yourself then decide if u liked it or not, I loved it!","

"9","SnoopyStyle","27 December 2018","In San Francisco, struggling reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is ordered to do a puff piece on bio-tech mogul Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the head of Life Foundation. Drake's spacecraft crashed after retrieving symbiotic lifeforms from a comet. Brock gets fired for asking tough questions to Drake and his fiancée Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) leaves him. Drake starts experimenting on people. Scientist Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) turns whistle-blower and sneaks Brock into the research facility. There, Brock is exposed to the symbiote Venom.I had reservations about a Venom movie without Spider-Man. I can safely say that this is vastly superior to Spider-Man 3. The interesting aspect is the relationship between Brock and Venom. They really become actual people and I can feel for them. Venom tells Brock that they're both losers. It's a surprising character reveal and one with good potential for future movies. It's a great way to do this version of Venom given the limitations of the rights issue. At first, I was concerned about Hardy but he turns in a compelling performance. I do have an issue Michelle Williams' hair. I can't tell if they deliberately gave her a bad cut or a bad wig. It does work to downgrade her from Hollywood stardom. It does set up Venom to have an ongoing franchise which is its major hurdle.","

"10","krazy-mm","3 October 2018","Had a test screening tonight in cinema I work at, and couldn't wait to watch my all-time favorite Marvel (anti) hero on big screen.
Tom Hardy is great as always, that guy really can act. Can't think of anyone else who would be a better choice for the role but him.
Introduction was really long, but I was not bored for a second. When Venom comes in his true form - the party starts! Wish few action scenes were less like Michael Bay's style (hardly see anything) but the inner child in me was really happy for Venom's maniacal kicking and punching around. Venom's character is really well made visually - his walking, jumping and smashing are just like in the comic books - thumbs up for that!Hope they will release R rated version on BluRay so we can see more of Venom's craziness. Tom Hardy allegedly said best parts are cut out to make the movie more age appropriate, and I think that's a shame. Anyway, I will watch this movie once more in cinema, and buy it on BluRay. After all, it's Venom!Go and see it on big screen - hope you won't be disappointed!Oh, and there are TWO mid-credit scenes - one we all are waiting for and another one that...just go and see it for yourself!","

"11","akdjreview","21 December 2021","Venom is a nice enjoyable superhero film which I was quite interested in. The film has a very Marvel story, it's not the first time I've seen a story like this one but with just different characters and different settings. Though the story of not knowing whether Venom is good or evil is an interesting aspect not really seen before.But I still found it quite enjoyable. There is no fantastic cinematography techniques or anything like that. But Venom played by Tom Hardy manages to deliver an amazing acting performance in comparison to other Marvel movies.I recommend Venom for superhero film fans to watch it's an interesting story with a little bit of a twist.","

"12","Top_Dawg_Critic","29 November 2018","You would think one of the 5 (why?) writers could have gotten this right. Tom Hardy was amazing, the directing excellent, cinematography on point, V/SFX not bad, but the story was very loose and had plot and pacing issues. Venom's voice was also annoying. You would think the producers would have hired better writers instead of pathetically paying for almost every review on here 9 and above being fake (pretty much only film reviewed). I may have given this film a 7 or 8 out of 10, but only gets a 6 for the fake reviews. For me it could have been much better and deserving of the 9's and 10's had the writing been tighter. Nevertheless, still enjoyable, but sadly only a 6/10 from me, mainly for the fake reviews that piss me off.","

"15","Anurag-Shetty","5 October 2018","Venom tells the story of news reporter, Eddie Brock(Tom Hardy). When a symbiote bonds with Eddie, he transforms into the deadly symbiote known as, Venom. Eddie will have to channel the powers of the symbiote, to save his life. Venom is an awesome film. Director Ruben Fleischer has done complete justice to the character of Venom after his disappointing portrayal in Spider-Man 3(2007). Still, we definitely miss that connection to Spider-Man because, Venom & Spider-Man are always connected in the comics. The action set pieces are fantastic. The critics can't whine about CGI fight scenes because, what more can you expect from a CGI character. Still, I wish they would have shown us some of the more nasty things that Venom did in the movie. An R rating would have helped but, I can understand why they decided to make the movie PG-13. They needed to make way for Spider-Man in possible sequels(fingers crossed). Tom Hardy is the star of the show as Eddie Brock/Venom. Hardy perfects the relationship between Eddie & Venom. Eddie being the vulnerable host & Venom being the caged animal that can be let loose at any time. There are a number of hysterical set pieces involving interactions between Eddie & Venom. Tom Hardy also perfects Venom's classic deep & gruff voice. Michelle Williams is brilliant as Anne Weying. It's nice to see Williams star in a comic book movie. Riz Ahmed is spectacular as Carlton Drake/Riot. Scott Haze is impressive as Security Chief Roland Treece. Reid Scott is great as Dr. Dan Lewis. Jenny Slate is amazing as Dr. Dora Skirth. The supporting cast is impressive. Venom is a must watch for Venom & Tom Hardy fans. Ignore the critics & go for it with moderate expectations.","

"16","Watcher42","25 November 2018","What an incredibly average film.It takes no risks. It's watered down. It's generic. It's trying to give the impression it's following Deadpool down the R-Rated super hero route, but it didn't have the guts to go the whole way, or even take a step really.Tom Hardy is an OK Eddie Brock, but I still find him a bit hit and miss as an actor, and that comes through even from scene to scene here. Sometimes he just mumbles his way through with no effort and I genuinely wondered if he was channeling Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, while other times he actually seemed to be trying, especially with the physical aspects. There's no connection or chemistry between Tom and Michelle Williams. I guess she was just hoping for some Marvel money and didn't realise this was a Sony picture. And the rest of the cast are incredibly average and forgettable. Especially Jenny Slate, who will always be stuck as Mona-Lisa from Parks & Rec.There's years of comic book lore and stories to draw on for Venom, but they ignore much of it... For example, why does Venom look like Spider-man? We know why from the comics, but in the movie it makes no mention of this, so we're left with questions and a very one dimensional character as a result.Of all the stories that could have been told about a symbiotic alien, and all the interesting directions they could have taken the story, they decide to go with what boils down to a boring buddy movie.","

"17","TheMovieDoctorful","5 October 2018","Wow...Something different...Something ACTUALLY different. No, Venom is no masterpiece. It's not perfect. It's not quite as great as I hoped it would be, but...It's ACTUALLY something different. And in an age where Marvel and DC give us the same comic book movie 500 times a year, that's incredibly high praise. Let me clarify; despite what you've been told, Venom is not a superhero movie. Venom is, at its heart, a horror comedy monster flick. It has much more in common in its characters, story, tone, comedy and action sequences with An American Werewolf in London or Evil Dead than, say, The Avengers or The Dark Knight. That's a wildly inventive and different take on the genre and enough to give it some much needed, genuine diversity.As I said, the film definitely has its problems. Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake is a terrible villain, one of the worst in recent comic book movie history. I'd like to say that he's better than most of the easily disposable MCU villains, but even compared to them, he's still low tier. Drake is your typical ""evil corporate bad guy"", but Ahmed is neither charismatic, over-the-top or intimidating enough to make it really work. The real shame is that the movie easily could have made him work as a perfect adversary for Hardy's Brock; a legally invulnerable, corrupt millionaire going up against an unlucky, lower class reporter with a chip on his shoulder. However, this dynamic is never really explored as much as it should be and, by the end of the day, his arc just ends in yet another case of 2 black CGI monsters smashing into each other.The neutered PG-13 rating also hurts the film significantly. To its credit, the film is surprisingly violent (To the point where my theater occasionally gasped) and there are moments of genuine suspense and terror here. However, at the end of the day, this is still the kind of movie where someone can get sliced in half with a blade arm and not leave a drop of blood. The edits are clear and blatant and I couldn't help but occasionally cringe at the obvious censor job Sony did to get the film at a more marketable PG-13. Here's hoping for an R-rated Director's Cut.I must say, Tom Hardy is perfect, as both Eddie Brock and Venom. As Eddie Brock, he's likable, goofy, charmingly dorky and incredibly sympathetic. As Venom, he's darkly hilarious, witty and commands an incredible screen presence. And his chemistry with Michelle Williams' Anne Weying (As both Venom and Eddie Brock) is off the charts. As somebody who frequently finds love stories in comic book films to be tepid and half hearted, this may be my favorite romance in a comic book film. It has its frequent adorable and sweet moments, but it isn't afraid to cover the more painful and stressful parts of their relationship either. It felt way more genuine to me than any other love story I've seen in a superhero movie. There's a scene in the 3rd act of the film involving Eddie, Michelle and the symbiote that is simultaneously sweepingly romantic, absolutely hilarious and incredibly bizarre. Without spoiling it, all I can say is that whether you love it or hate it, you won't forget that moment any time soon.Michelle Williams is fantastic in her own right too. She does an excellent job portraying Weying's spunk, confidence and intelligence and Williams brings both charisma and emotional vulnerability to the role. Weying herself is a surprisingly strong character as well; she's arguably even more proactive than Eddie is and I loved watching her arc from distant and condescending to more empathetic and compassionate. I've missed the days when love interests in comic book movies had genuine character arcs, so Williams' Weying was another breath of fresh air in a comic book movie already full of them.The comedy is definitely the highlight. This is by far the funniest comic book film I've seen to date, it puts both Deadpool movies to shame. It's very reminiscent of a John Landis or Sam Raimi horror comedy from the 80s. Complete insanity in the best way. There's a particular scene in a restaurant that had me laughing so hard my lungs hurt.As for the story, again, it's not particularly deep, but its clever in its own way, and has its admitted emotional moments regarding Anne and Eddie's relationship. The film works as a very interesting anti-Spider-Man movie; Eddie's irresponsibility is as essential to the character as Peter's responsibility and the movie tells a very compelling journey of a deeply self absorbed man having to learn to finally put the people around him above his own self interests when the chips are down. Even Eddie's relationship with his suit serves as a dark mirror to Spider-Man; in Homecoming, Peter has to learn that he doesn't need the suit to be a hero. In Venom, Eddie needs the friendship of his own suit to save the day.Venom is not the best comic book movie ever. It's not quite as great as I had hoped. But it's the farthest thing from bad. It has more heart and brains than critics are giving it credit for and it's a desperately needed original take on a genre that's admittedly been suffering from repetition, exhaustion and over-saturation. It's definitely more interesting, bold and rewatchable than 80% of the easily disposable and forgettable MCU films. It'll probably be more interesting, bold and rewatchable than any of the DCEU films post-Justice League (Including Justice League), which may as well be MCU-lite. I think I'm gonna go watch it again.(Also, very minor point, but that Eminem song was awful. It felt like a Vanilla Ice or MC Hammer song, only unironic and played completely straight. It was actually lowkey embarrassing to listen to.)","

"18","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","5 October 2018","I knew it. The film was not even half as bad as the critics said. VENOM is the electrifying action movie you need to see in theaters. I saw it today in 4DX 3D and found it highly entertaining. There are a lot of white knuckle action scenes enhanced further by a solid CGI work. An exhilarating vehicular chase sequence had me excited to the core and so did all the other action sequences. Tom Hardy's performance is impressive. His interactions with Venom are heart winning. VENOM is ultimately fast paced. I didn't realize when time flew by. This film has made me like Venom a lot. I liked him in SPIDER-MAN 3 also (which was a great movie in my opinion) but he wasn't portrayed as a hero in that one. In this one, Venom will definitely not be hated. There is also a good amount of comedy and horror present in the film although primarily this is an action movie with a science fiction setting.VENOM definitely reminded me of the dark atmosphere built by Sam Raimi in his Spider-Man movies. That's another reason why I wanted to watch it. It's a highly entertaining action entertainer which needs to be seen and enjoyed as a whole. Since this is anyways an origin story, don't expect it to be overstuffed. Just book your tickets, grab some eatables, bring along a friend or be alone, and watch this film on the biggest screen possible, in 3D. Plus, there are some interesting surprises towards the end, so feel free to stay instead of just walking away. P.S. - I have not read any Venom comics till date.","

"19","tresm87","7 October 2018","While it may break away from the comics slightly by not including the Spiderman origin story, the true characterization integrity within Eddie Brock/Venom is vibrant and extremely close to source material. The story alteration might even improve the overall direction of this new standalone Venom series because now we can truly focus on Brock/venom and not have Parker/Spiderman constantly take away from his attention. I believe we've had enough of Spiderman, and honestly after the travesty that was Homecoming imho, I'm fine with that for now. Venom starts off with a bang and we get some nice new aspects to how the symbiotes came to be in this earth as well as some great character development of Eddie Brock's life before Venom. Let me just say that Tom Hardy Makes this entire film work with a completely passionately versatile performance showing immense acting talent like he always does. Once Eddie Brock achieves full symbiosis, it becomes an absolutely intense and fun experience to witness, and it really brought me back to the old comics. I've been a fan of venom for nearly 30 years and I can honestly say they nailed the relationship between Brock and venom, and it's damn right awesome to see it on the big screen. The action never lets up after that and there were some insanely well done sequences full of amazing visuals. I honestly thought the CGI use for venom looked spectacular, and about as good as you could have it. The unexpected X factor of this film was it's hilariously twisted dialogue between Brock and venom, and honestly at times it was almost charming in a way. While there were a few bits that were absolutely ridiculous, I was able to overlook those few and far between moments. I thought Riz Ahmed what is a serviceable enough Carlton drake/riot, and played the conniving billionaire villain decently. I do think the plot was a bit rushed towards the end, but the finale was very exciting regardless. The post credit scene leaves you with an incredible sense of anticipation for the next venom installment as it introduces one of the most violent and brutal characters in all of comics. I did however think he was going to be in this film a lot more and was slightly disappointed ,but when I know what the future holds, I can forget about that slight nitpick. Another huge aspect of this film that breaks away from the safe MCU formula, is its sheer visceral brutality minus any blood really. They actually did a great job on a PG-13 rating making it still a very dark and violent film with some outstanding body horror sequences. I do really hope that they will go for an R rating for the sequel once carnage starts wreaking pure havoc. They would benefit so much from making it R rated. Overall an excellent origin tale,and a surprisingly funny film that deserves a ton of credit for going against the grain and breaking out of MCU formulas to start its own Venom universe. This is not part of the MCU and it's better off for it. I cannot wait for the next film to see Harrelson bring the CARNAGE!","

"20","kevinxirau","12 October 2018","Being that it's October, the month of monsters, there couldn't have been a more appropriate superhero to come out than Venom. Easily one of the most popular Spider-man characters, he made his big screen debut in 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"", which not only failed to impress audiences, but proved to be a great disservice to Venom. Luckily, Sony makes up for this grave mistake with this new film. Plot: Tom Hardy is Eddie Brock, a journalist digging into the dirty secrets of the shady corporation, the Life Foundation, where he becomes an unwilling host to an alien Symbiote brought to Earth by a rocket ship. As the unlikely pair of man and ravenous parasite endeavors to find a compromise, they must become one as Venom to both survive and prevent more symbiotes from making Earth their new home. Right off the bat, they got Venom right; the internal struggle, the design, and the twisted sense of humor. Hardy gives a well-acted performance as both Eddie and the Symbiote, the two halves bouncing back and forth in a terrific fashion. They alone sell this flick. The supporting cast holds up too with Michelle Williams as Anne Weying doing a good job playing the love interest with a believable relationship. The nods to previous media are also welcome with the mid-credit scene making me geek out. One word best describes the action: savage. The movie works around its PG-13 rating with some satisfyingly kickass fight scenes that get away with nasty-looking deaths (would've preferred rated R, but it works nonetheless). ""Venom"" starts a little slow, getting you into the cast and story organically, but once the titular anti-hero comes out to play, things become seriously fun. An issue that didn't really ruin it for me was that the climax has Venom battling a similarly colored villain (Riot) in a night setting, which made it tricky to see what was going on at times (a differently colored nemesis would've fixed this). The music fits the film as well, having a cool edgy, pseudo-horror vibe to it. All in all, ""Venom"" is a killer good time. Future films are already planned, so I look forward to seeing the toothy alien freak in action once more.","

I can see where some people found it to be stupid entertainment and silly fun, but that's not exactly the way I like movies. There are always exceptions, but with a cast like Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Woody Harrelson (sort of), I expect a lot more. The script for this film is by far one of the worst things put to film over the last few years. I flat out laughed out loud at how bad some of these lines were. And by no means did I think most of this humor was intentional. If you watch any of the trailers for the film, they are pitching a serious & dark take on the Venom character, so don't give me the whole ""it's supposed to bad"" take. That's just not true. You can forget ever seeing Spider-Man show up in these movies, at least if Sony/Marvel wants me to take him seriously at all. There's no sense in going through and ripping apart each and every part of this film, just know that I disliked the entire thing. Nope, I take that back, I hated it.1.7/10","

"23","Pjtaylor-96-138044","3 October 2018","'Venom (2018)' is usually just fine, but it never comes close to being properly engaging or even all that entertaining. It just constantly skirts the line between being pretty decent and just downright boring. This - combined with its overall weak, poorly paced narrative and its general technical choppiness (including noticeably 'jumpy' editing and several scenes that are strangely blurry, to the point that it seems like the focus-puller might've been asleep) - means that the overall experience isn't all that good. The film certainly lands with a whimper rather than a roar. It actually takes ages for Brock to become the eponymous big boy and, when he does, the dynamic between him and his newfound companion never comes close to being fully formed or even consistent. This means that we can't really relate to - or care for - either of them and that their motivations don't really make all that much sense. Their relationship is supposed to be the driving force of the story, yet it doesn't naturally evolve and never comes close to being compelling. To make matters worse, the whole thing culminates in an awful, CG mess of a finale that's literally difficult to watch, much less comprehend. It inexplicably goes back on several core conceits simply to have our symbiotic lead emerge as a more 'traditional' hero, despite the piece being billed as a decidedly 'villainous' affair. The feature is pretty tame in general, to be honest. It all just comes across as more of poor man's 'Upgrade (2018)' than anything else. Don't even get me started on the absolute joke of an end-credits scene. 4/10.","

Special effects were quite awesome, some of the fight scenes (chasing sequence and climax fight scenes) were amazing. The interaction between Eddie and Venom were quite funny at times.I also felt the movie was too short, having less than 2 hours duration which include the long end credit scenes. Btw, it has 1 mid end credit scene which I think could only be appreciated by the fans of the comic books and 1 post end credit scene. So be sure not too leave your seats too soon.The sound effects with Dolby Atmos was awesome and it is also specialized for IMAX theaters. Overall it was quite fun and entertaining movie. Oh and this movie is in Spider-man own universe but NOT Marvel Cinematic Universe, so you need to manage your expectations.For my complete review, please have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id","

It truly baffles me that Sony would not take enough risks to release the film with an R rating. I wonder how much of this film was left on the cutting floor!?! Tom Hardy's performance is also on point and...just go see it.","
