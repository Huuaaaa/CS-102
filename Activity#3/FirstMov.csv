"1","ThomDerd","5 January 2020","Grace is about to marry the youngest member of the very wealthy Le Domas family. But there's something sinister going on with this family... Well, the movie's central idea is not that new but the delivery of the idea, the pace and the performance of Samara Weaving really elevate this film. Entertaining and tense with comical moments that fit the genre, will make you follow almost all the characters in the film. Also kudos to the slow costume transformation of the bride and the juxtaposition of the prior wedding shots with what happens after, as this helps create a sense of relatability with Grace.One of the entertaining movies of 2019.8/10.","

"2","kosmasp","8 February 2020","Or is it? Right from the start we do realize there is more to it than just a simple game. So with that overshadowing the next section of the movie (viewer being ahead of our main character/heroine), it is up to the actors and the dialog/script to keep us on our toes and make this entertaining nonetheless.And the movie succeeds in doing so. I guess it could have been even better in some respects, but overall this is really good. The characters make sense (in their own universe) and the story is coherent enough (even if you may disagree with that statement during the end - I think the joke works quite well ... but that's me). Not for the faint hearted for sure ...","

"3","planktonrules","31 October 2020","""Ready of Not"" is a very, very violent, bloody and crude film. I am not necessarily criticizing it for this, but you must know this before you decide to watch. It clearly is an adult film...but even one most adults might have trouble watching because of all the gore. Be forewarned...you will see extreme violence, exploding people and more!!! Think twice before you watch!!This should be the best day of Grace's life. After all, she's just married a handsome guy from an incredibly wealthy family. But apparently, this marriage comes with a possible downside....the family are all Satan worshipers who owe their immense wealth to their demon master. And, as part of maintaining their wealth, they have a ritual for when new blood marries into the family...and if you pick the wrong card, the family hunts you and sacrifices you! What follows is this crazy family and their servants chasing Grace about in order to kill her and impress their lord and master!Despite the summary and TONS of blood and gore, the film is also a comedy. It's not a fall on the floor laughing sort of film but a darkly sick and twisted sort of comedy. The ending combines both...intense gore and the biggest laughs of the movie. Not everyone's taste...but funny and sick. And, it's also not for those who get motion sick, as the shaky cam is, unfortunately, overused in the movie.","

Samara Weaving is masterful in the type genre and I absolutely love how there's dark comedy in a few parts. It's very important to note this is very gory no it's not a spoiler just a warning for the squeamish type; for the horror fans you're in for a wonderful treat!Edit since this review is doing so well my name is Alex Nolan and I'd like to become very well known like Roger Ebert!!","

I didn't know much about it going in. I honestly couldn't pick how it would end which means I was interested the whole way through.I liked all of the performances, especially those of Samara Weaving and Adam Brody. They had interesting characters. Andie MacDowell and Henry Czerny were great too. Everyone was. No one let the team down.I really enjoyed this movie. I honestly don't understand all the 1 and 2 ratings. Even if you didn't like it, it doesn't deserve that low of a rating. It was just a really fun movie to watch. Give it a chance.","

"6","Leofwine_draca","20 October 2020","READY OR NOT is an interesting film but also a deeply flawed one that's never quite as funny or as entertaining as it tries to be. I liked the whole idea of the sinister rich family in their wonderful 'old dark house' inspired mansion and the idea of the heroine being hunted down, a little like the French flick FRONTIERS. Unfortunately what promises to be a TURKEY SHOOT-style cat and mouse story of human hunting turns into a largely aimless comedy with repetitive set-pieces and a sub-par script substituting bad language for wit. It's a pity, as the direction is solid and the performances are strong, but imagine this cast with proper dialogue to play with! I also found the climax a cop out as I was expecting this kind of over-obvious thing to happen. Not a bad film, just something I was expecting more from.","

"7","Bertaut","14 October 2019","Written by Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy, and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, Ready or Not is a horror-comedy and social satire that comically exaggerates the anxieties attendant with marrying into a wealthy family and mocks the insular nature of such families, so obsessed with their wealth that they've become disconnected from the real world. In the tradition of Richard Connell's 1924 short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"", the film is about elites hunting common folk, but it tells its story with tongue firmly in cheek. And whilst it can be a tad episodic at times, and the manner in which it presents some of its violence is somewhat problematic, this is a very enjoyable and funny film that's well worth checking out.It is the wedding day of Grace (an exceptional Samara Weaving) and Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), whose family earned their fortune making board games, and are now decadently wealthy. Several years previously, Alex turned his back on the family, and it's only since he met Grace (a foster child eager to have a family to call her own) that he has started to rebuild bridges. His mother Becky (Andie MacDowell) and father Tony (a barely sane Henry Czerny) are thrilled to have him back, and credit Grace with his return. His aunt Helene (a hilariously acerbic Nicky Guadagni), however, makes no bones about the fact that she hates Grace. Elsewhere there's Alex's brother Daniel (Adam Brody), an alcoholic locked in a loveless marriage to Charity (Elyse Levesque), and their cocaine-addicted sister Emilie (a wonderfully hapless Melanie Scrofano) and her husband Fitch (a scene-stealing Kristian Bruun). Shortly after the ceremony, Alex explains a strange family tradition to Grace - whenever someone new marries into the clan, they must participate in a game, chosen at random by a mechanised box using a deck of cards (Charity gor checkers). At an austere ceremony, Grace is asked to operate the box and she receives the hide and seek card, with Tony explaining that the only way for her to win is to stay hidden until dawn. And so, Grace hides in the mansion, unaware that the family (sans Alex) are arming themselves with crossbows, axes, hunting rifles, and assorted antique weaponry.The film's various psychoanalytical/satirical subtexts are fairly obvious - a lampooning of blue blood families clueless as to how the real world works, a savage deconstruction of the institution of marriage, and a gynocentric celebration of a woman fighting back against old-world patriarchy. In relation to these last two themes, nowhere are they more apparent than in Grace's wedding dress, that most classic symbol of marriage, which becomes dirtier and more damaged as the film progresses, with costume designer Avery Plewes using the dress to show the stages of Grace's symbolic deconstruction of the institution of marriage (to survive the night, she must make the dress more conducive to running and hiding, which involves a lot of ripping and tearing).Concerning the film's engagement with wealth, essentially it suggests that, yes, as we all know, the rich are very different from you and I, but could it be that not only are they different, maybe they're actually evil? Of course, it's not suggesting this with anything even approaching realism, and much of the film's humour comes from the Le Domas family itself; they're wealthy, evil, violent, and powerful, but so too are they hilariously incompetent. For example, it's been so long since anyone has got the hide and seek card that everyone is a little fuzzy on the rules, and they spend a good chunk of the film arguing with one another about the hunt - Fitch and Charity want to use modern weapons, but Tony maintains they have to use antique weaponry, nor are they allowed to use the castle's security cameras to track Grace.This all goes back to a century-old deal made between the family's original patriarch Victor and a mysterious traveller named Mr Le Bail, who promised Victor that the family would become hugely wealthy, but only if they maintained the tradition of having new family members play a game on their wedding night, laying out the rules for what was to happen if they got the hide and seek card. Tony argues that the rules can be no different from those originally established by Le Bail, but, really, his argument never amounts to much more than ""tradition...reasons"". The film gets a lot of laughs out of showing characters trying to get to grips with their weapon - from Fitch taking time out from the hunt to look up ""how to use a crossbow"" videos on YouTube to Emilie accidentally dispatching several maids due to her inability to handle her weapon.Another theme, although one not developed to the extent of the above, is religion. Le Bail, for example, is believed by the family to be a demonic figure, and his name, obviously enough, is an anagram of Belial, the demon from the Tanakh who would later form the basis for the Christian and Jewish depictions of Satan. On the other hand, Grace's name most likely references the idea of Divine grace. Elsewhere, the film depicts a pit of slaughtered goats, alluding to ritual animal sacrifice, a pre-Christian practice. Goats are also important in Christianity, especially in the practice of scapegoating, whereby a goat takes upon it the sins of the community and is cast into the desert, symbolically removing the taint of those sins (as per Leviticus 16:8-10). Along the same lines, Grace injures her hand on a nail, in a veiled reference to the Stigmata. However, whether or not we're supposed to interpret her as a Christ figure is hard to say as, although these references are interesting in isolation, they never really coalesce into anything concrete.Looking at some other problems, the film is, generally speaking, very slight; it's short and it's silly, and it's not going to change your life or lead you down the road of esoteric revolution. The violence is also (somewhat) problematic. The film maintains the stance that the rich are insane and the violence they mete out is contemptible. However, some of the biggest laughs are reserved for Emilie's accidental killing of the maids. And I have to admit, I found the way she haplessly dispatches two of them exceptionally funny. Also funny is that after one of the kills, the family are trying to have a conversation, which is continually interrupted by the gurgling of a mortally wounded maid; until Helene takes an axe to her head. And again, I have to admit, I laughed a lot at that scene, even though I recognised that the film was essentially asking the audience to see this violence as funny but some of the violence elsewhere as not so much. In this sense, it kind of wants to have its cake and eat it, picking and choosing when the audience should laugh; it takes Grace's stakes seriously but also encourages us to laugh at some (and only some) of the violence elsewhere, which is problematically inconsistent.Nevertheless, as I said, these scenes did make me laugh, so make of that what you will. Although Ready or Not is slight, its satirical ire is focused, even if the tendency towards irreverence doesn't always chime with the tone of the socio-political agenda. Allegorically skewering inherited wealth, marriage, tradition, even religion, the film suggest that with their atavistic rules and sense of entitlement, the Le Domas family embody the concept that old-money can lead to insularity from modernity. Offering us a match, the film suggests that perhaps the only way to deal with such irrelevancies and their sense of self-importance is to burn them to the ground. And it has a blast showing us why.","

Still filled with bonehead decision making, as one would expect with a horror type film.Samara Weaving does well as the bride, and surprisingly does not just turn into some random badass with a mystery background complete with combat training.Think 'Knives Out' mixed with 'The Hunt' and voila, you have 'Ready or Not'.","

The characters are perfect from the creepy over the top aunt to the leading protagonist Samara weaving. Acting is on point and the movie never slows up(dig to the crazy person saying it's boring)The movie actually has an ending, and what a great ending too. The movie delivers on everything they intended to give you and more.Sooo don't listen to the non constructive low critics and make your own decision and go watch","

"13","neil-476","12 November 2020","When Grace marries into the Le Domas family, whose great wealth is from the sales of games, it's not a huge surprise to find out that a family game features on her wedding night. The game is Hide and Seek, and it turns out that the object is not so much to avoid being found, it's more to avoid being found and killed.This simple idea is played for all it's worth between a varied crop of family members and the necessarily resourceful Grace. The cast is low profile but very good, the film is nicely staged, there is a decent story and script, and the combination of bloodshed and laughs works well. This is not laugh-out-loud, but the steady stream of black comedy is constantly amusing.I really liked this.","

"14","kluseba","23 August 2019","Ready or Not tries to be a mixture of a comedy and a horror movie and fails at both. The movie is never atmospheric, intense or scary enough to be a great horror movie. The film is never clever, surprising or vibrant enough to be an entertaining comedy movie. Even by poor b-movie standards, the story of this film is completely ridiculous in a way that it's almost insulting.If you were wondering why this film still deserves four points, the movie isn't entirely bad. The settings look great and especially the mansion where the sinister hide and seek game takes place is really gorgeous, including hidden hallways and elegant gardens. The movie features a few intense action scenes that make you root for the desperate lead character. The film has a fast pace and doesn't overstay its welcome with plodding storytelling. Lead actress Samara Weaving does her best with a poor script and has enough charisma to be the only great actress in this film.Ready or Not should be ignored since it's neither a gripping horror film nor a clever comedy. It's a shallow action film with a few gore elements. Movies like You're Next are similar in style but executed much better. The overtly positive reviews for Ready or Not show that expectations for horror movies have significantly decreased in an era of prequels, remakes, sequels and overall rehashed ideas. Refer to European or Asian cinema to find some creative horror movies these days.","

"15","tmpsvita","7 November 2020","Never seen a movie so dumb and so smart at te same time.
So dumb cause well just read the story it's almost ridiculously stupid but at the same time so smart cause it knows what it is: pure fun entertainment. It never takes itself too seriously, it often jokes about its nature and it plays with it constantly especially with over the top dialogs and grotesque characters that fit perfectly into every, absurd, situation.
Situations where the lead character, the spouse (that Samara Weaving plays with tons of charisma), acts exactly how we all would have done even with smart decisions that rarely in an horror a protagonist takes.
The intelligence of this movie is its awareness of how to work perfectly, with enough weirdness, enough absurdity, enough charisma, enough blood (so much blood) and this makes it a very fun, enjoyable experience.","

Whether she gets killed or whether the mumbo jumbo truly exists is the highlight which gets bogged down by the lack of suspense or tension.
Rightly stated by BA_Harrison that the secret doors, rooms n servant tunnels r not covered properly.
The film does get a bit monotonous. The side characters get killed while our scream queen gets to survive a hell lottuva ordeal.
The maids r hot babes but they dont have much to do. None of the kills r memorable.
Watch out for aunt Helene with her comical hairstyle n a never give up attitude who is always ready with an axe.","

In fact, it is almost too funny to be a ""horror"" film, and although it was certainly gory, it had nowhere near the gore of most horror films. It was just right IF you are looking for a film to satisfy the horror-seeking fan in you and which makes you laugh at the same time. In my book, the best of both worlds.As for the reviews which mention violence towards women: get over it. I'm a woman and I detest women like these reviewers who demand to be seen as something more, but then fail to live up to being able to 'take it'. Grow up. You give real women like me a bad name by association.In closing, this is one I highly suggest you watch for yourselves and make up your own mind about, but go in knowing that there is humor in it and hardly any scares. In short, a bloody good time.","

This is the third best movie of the year - not kidding.The movie manage to deliver all the blood, guts, and gory darkness you can possibly wish for together with plenty of laughs. This is horror, comedy and great acting in a movie which surprises and have one of the greatest ending of any movie I have seen in a long time.I do think that the movie feels too short, it should have been dragged out a little bit more - especially for us to get to know everyone a bit more so we feel more when they go poff or get their heads chopped off or shot or strangled or...
I also think a few things do not make total sense, however it is a horror drama comedy so I suppose that is not completely needed.
And sure, yes, it has a bit of that B-movie feel to it, the production value is not bad but it is not great either.
A few choices I wish was made different, but overall those are the negatives as I see them.I give it a 8/10, and I highly recommend.","

It's been a while since I've seen a horror film as satisfying (and as much fun) as this one.From the trailer, I expected a slapstick comedy horror, but this was not the case - thankfully. Although the film contains humor (that are actually funny and not slapstick), this was a nerve wrecking, suspenseful film that crawled in under my skin.Samara Weaving is FANTASTIC as Grace, the unsuspecting bride. The film might not have worked so well with another lead. She's the perfect lead for this film. 'Ready or Not' is a very different and refreshing take on the slasher genre. I also loved the setting in the big mansion. The film is wonderfully mysterious in the beginning and keeps you guessing until the finale. There's a few unexpected twists, as well.

"24","GusherPop","30 November 2022","Grace (Samara Weaving) loves Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien) so much that she's tolerated the hoops through which his family have made her jump: Alcoholic wastrel Daniel (Adam Brody) hitting on her, mother Becky (Andie MacDowell) being somewhat cagey about her approval, sister Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) not even showing up in time for the ceremony, father Tony (Henry Czerny) outright voicing his displeasure at the girl's status and aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni) staring daggers at her from the moment they met. They're a bizarre bunch but Grace sees the light at the end of the tunnel now that they've all congregated at the Le Domas manor for the nuptials. However, and it's a big however, the film is charismatic and thrilling enough to bypass its shortcomings. Weaving makes for a very likable hero, with a broad comedic appeal, an every-girl clumsiness and sarcastic rejoinder for everything. In a better world, she'd be headlining comedies already. She makes for a likable action hero precisely because she knows and shows that the clothes don't fit her. In her tattered wedding dress, she fights for her life against everyone from her young nephews to the butler. Every wound she receive shows her that the backwards morality by which the rich live is so deeply ingrained that no amount of pleading could right the course. It's also her first clue that not even her beloved Alex will be able to get her out of this jam. She's not just fighting people, she's fighting tradition and the idea of family. By the time the games come to an end, ""Ready or Not"" has ceased to be about the rich and the poor. It's about a girl trying to survive a violent ordeal, which is potent enough for the moment you're watching the film, but in a climate in which politics can pull a film from a release schedule, now is not the time to hide.","

The game in the comedy horror film Ready or Not...is definitely one of those ""worse games""!When a bride-to-be is married into a lavish, rich, and weird family, she soon discovers that they really stick to tradition...and tradition in this house, is anything but fun and games! Each time someone is welcomed into the family, they must play a game. For the bride, the game is hide and seek. All she has to do, is avoid being caught by dawn. Sounds easy right? Well, not with the family armed with ancient weapons and planning to perform a ritual on you it isn't! With the bride's new husband being the only reluctant and helpful one, she must outwit, out hide, and out smart the deranged and insane clan, until a supposable curse threatens to, supposably kill the family!I made a brilliant choice to see this film! And you will too, if you decide to play the game! The direction of Mr. Matt Bettinelli Olpin, and Mr. Tyler Gillett is excellent! I loved how the camera follows and moves with those who are running for their lives, and the still shots on lots of stuffed animal heads and pictures on the walls; these shots made the film seem a bit like a 90's or 80's era film, which I appreciated. The dark humor was pretty good too, but I especially loved the acting. I adored all the cast members and their splendid talent, especially, Samara Weaving, who played the traumatized, and frightened bride! As for the supposable death that will befall the family if dawn arrives...well, even they aren't sure if it's true! And that's part of the curious mystery!To any brides-to-be-wedded-into-a-new-family, be careful whose family you're welcomed to join, for as the words on the movie poster say: ""In-laws can be murder!""","
