"1","kevin_robbins","20 November 2023","My wife and I watched The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023) in theaters last night. The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment.","

"2","Tweetienator","21 November 2023","In my opinion, there are two major issues with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead.","

"3","skylermoore","23 November 2023","No matter how faithful a movie is to the book, it can't save itself from the fact that it's unneeded. Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary.","

"4","nscoby93","23 November 2023","I don't know where to start this review as I am just exhausted. Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, ""What am I missing?"" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, ""There's more?"" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10

Rachel Zegler is a great singer and a great actress. The songs are very important to the story, every song contains an important part of the movie ESPECIALLY the one she sings laying down by the lake.People need to actually pay attention to what they're watching.","

"6","movieman6-413-929510","19 November 2023","The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a prequel to the Hunger Games film series. This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12.","

"7","gabriel-80","15 November 2023","I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time.","

"8","ArchilArjevanidze","17 November 2023","I'm staggered by the stupidity of the script, the characters, story arcs, motive, plot. It's mindless and random most of the times, seemed like an AI wrote it based on a templates of generic films. Good guy turns bad just because story needs him to be, two characters fall in love just for the sake of it. The dialogue between friends is constant plot point and a script note where main dude always highlights how he is poor and his friend has a rich dad, it can become a fun game because whenever these two are in the scene together you start to expect it to be mentioned, and it always does lol. Very bad, maybe writers strike affected it, but it's based on a book and I don't know maybe it's the source, I doubt I'll read it after this anyway.","

"9","dannibairstow","26 November 2023","I will start by saying I don't think it's an 8, maybe a 7.5-7.7 so I rounded up.However, I went in with low expectations, expecting a big budget movie with a poor storyline but otherwise reasonably watchable. Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray"" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews. Like, what were you watching!?","

"11","pete-murphy97","18 November 2023","""The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" is about as overlong as its title might suggest. It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth.Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition.The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader.He partakes as a ""mentor"" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war.The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor.The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV.She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality.The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels.5/10.","

"12","ameliethomson","19 November 2023","Once you notice how they feel the need to say « Lucy Gray » all the time, you won't be able to unhear it, it's painful. Lucy Gray this, Lucy Gray that...
Viola Davis is excellent, atmosphere and setting are ok, but all in all it feels like you're watching 3 different movies in one, scenario is - again - the main issue. Main actor lacks charisma and just isn't good enough to be a lead. The singing is really annoying, I don't care if it's like that in the book, they could have integrated it in a much better way. The guitar thing at the tribute presentation... is it X-Factor? And I really wanted to like this movie...","

It's always interesting to see how certain things from the book were adapted on screen, adding a new experience to the story I've read.The production value, scene locations, and overall ambiance were simply amazing, capturing the essence and aesthetics of the book properly.The music, especially ""The Hanging Tree"", that Katniss sang in the original trilogy, was a highlight, linking this prequel to the original trilogy nicely. Also, the song that Olivia Rodrigo did for this movie ""Can't Catch Me Now"" fit the film's mood and themes well.","

The characters have similar dialogues to the ones found in the books. The actors do good acting. The scenes have the right pacing. Yet, the movie is boring and you end up not caring about anything that happened.I guess reading the story from the point of view of cunning Snow helps us understand better his feeling and motivations, here we don't have that and the actor have next to no chemistry! Their actions don't seem like a natural progression of their love and feel more like ""this happens next cause the book said so"".I was really looking forward to watching it. This movie was such a let down for me.","

Overall, a poorly executed movie as the direction and writing fail to build Snow up to be a bad guy to the point that they have to force this by the time the movie ends (making the first two acts of the movie feel pointless), but the movie is entertaining in the second act because they convey The Hunger Games well.Pretty Bad Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good as the director uses the large sets, VFX, and cinematography to help paint these grand scenes in both the capital and the arena of The Hunger Games (while at the same time showing its grime and dark side), the direction of The Hunger Games was good and kept the movie engaging in the middle part; the direction on a microscale was bad as the interpersonal scenes did not feel fluid at all and were not well executed; the direction of actors was bad as none of of the performances felt like they were elevated by direction; storytelling was poor as there doesn't feel like a sense of where the movie is going as builds to one thing and drastically disposes of it in favor of a something else), Decent Acting (Pretty Good from Tom Blyth (Shows some range of emotion and shows both the good and the bad side of Snow decently well), Pretty Bad from Rachel Zegler (Her accent kept on slipping and she kinda feels out of place with the rest of the cast (and the chemistry between her and Blyth is not the best); her musical moments (while forced) were carried out well as she shows off how good of a singer she is), Pretty Good from Peter Dinklage (Really just feels like he is playing many of the characters he has played in the past (the drunk character who has a lot to say) so he kinda just goes on his own), Good from Jason Schwartzman (The best performance of the movie as he plays the comedic relief character well), Pretty Bad from Hunter Schafer (Very emotionless and doesn't have any emotion with Blyth), Decent from Josh Andrés Rivera (Has moments where he shines and some moments where it feels like he's overacting), Decent from Viola Davis (Not really her best performance as it is a lot of overacting (but it doesn't feel like it is a bad performance, just not the best direction)), Decent from the rest of the cast (Hard to comment as most of the cast is child actors who feel like they weren't given the best direction)), Bad Story (The concept was pretty good as it was interesting to see the early Hunger Games and the origins of President Snow (though the carrying out of this concept was very bad); the story contruction was terrible as first act drags so much that its boring and the third act is completely out of place as it felt like they forgot to make Snow the bad guy (the second act is pretty good as its just The Hunger Games and plays to the strengths of the franchise); storytelling/flow between sequences was bad as every scene just felt forced and nothing felt like it flowed between each other (and this is especially seen in the final act as the movie has to make up for making Snow be the good guy when hes supposed to be the bad guy; character writing was very bad (Snow is terribly written as they put so much emphasis on sympathiszing him and making him be the good guy that they run out of time in making him be the bad guy and rush/force this part of the character in the end, Lucy Gray Baird is not written either as you really don't cate about her as her singing just gets really annoying towards the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue did not flow and was kinda forced; the tension build was good and carried out well in The Hunger Games act; the symbolism was very shallow as it does not do a good job in building Snow's journey for power; the foreshadowing was none-existent as the movie forces the ending because they forgot to make Snow the bad guy in the first two acts), Good Score (Carries different motifs from the original franchise), Good Cinematography (Helped show how grand the capital was and helped build the world (especially in The Hunger Games)), Good Sound (Helped in the action scenes), Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Helped make the movie feel like it was a part of the franchise and did not feel over-the-top in any way), Good Production Design (Helped with building the world), Plot Structure was the biggest issue for the movie as 2 out of the three acts were pointless (the first act builds Snow to be a good guy and really drags, the second act is pretty good as it is just The Hunger Games, and the third act is just so forced as it clearly shows that they forgot to make Snow the bad guys so they rush to give him moments that show how he's not a good person); The movie could've been split into two movies to help with runtime (with the entire third act being spun off to show how bad of a person Snow is as there are some moments in the second act that could allude to him being a bad guy, something a second movie could take and build on), Pacing was slow in the first and third act (especially in the third) but pretty good in the second act as the fast pace helped build tension in The Hunger Games, Climax was so underwhelming it was more laughable than entertaining, Tone was very similar to other Hunger Games movies.","

"16","brianjohnson-20043","22 November 2023","I started the book but did not get far. And now after watching the movie I realize that I would have liked it probably even less if I had read the entire book. Probably the biggest problem is that none of the main characters seem likable or realistic enough in the world for me to root for them or have the emotional down-spiral of the characters to be a good tragic drama.There is sort of this 1950s steampunk aesthetic that also made no sense to me given that this is supposed to take place in our distance future rather than the somewhat recent past. How/why would TVs in the future start to become anything like TV screens from the 50s? Are they also going to reinvent laserdiscs?The way the hunger games unfolds makes it feel completely absurd that the winner would win even with all of the cheating. Also the 2 big dramatic scenes after the games just seems confusing. Especially intermixed with some of the other scenes around them. Maybe he works better with all of the perspectives and time that an author is given in a book. But it certainly didn't make a lot of sense to me.Stumbling across the guns later in the film seemed way too coincidental too. And the motivations of the main characters was so inconsistent from one moment to the next near the end that he started to seem bipolar and phycho. I don't think they sufficiently developed his character so one could understand why/how he would work so hard for power and control. The beginning had him challenged that power and control so much that it was a wonder why he would even want any power and control over a society that he just barely seemed to care about.All in all. It's a mess, but interesting to try to follow because it seems to be such a mess.The actors seemed alright. The music was good. The cinematography was fine. But the story and characters didn't seem well developed to me. And I was frequently wondering why these characters and this timeline was being presented given that it didn't seem to answer many questions compare to all the questions and problems it raised.","

"17","naomix-07733","18 November 2023","Initially I didn't like the ending. I didn't like how they just made her 'disappear'. I was voicing my frustration to my sister the entire way home; No chase? No fighting? No crying, no betrayal, no epilogue, no letter? Nothing??? It was so anti-climactic! Like she never even existed!But then Highbotton's words rang clear: mystery has a way of driving people mad. If we the audience were this frustrated, imagine just how delirious it must've made Snow. She could've outed him, betrayed him, stood up to him, maybe even messaged him- he must've searched for her if just to get rid of the last loose end (before he became too powerful to even bother with this anymore, of course), but he found absolutely nothing! Nothing to chase, nothing to hate, nothing to even confirm that it was real other than his fading memories, white roses and a ghost of her who with the same spirit sings that damn song under the hanging tree.I can't help but think that what if she'd stayed? He'd lied, and he had violence, and all those other bad things in his being already, but the only thing that was keeping him from going through that door was Lucy gray. It doesn't excuse nor explain his action (not even by the slightest) but I can't help but wonder if she'd stayed, would he still turn out that way? Not necessarily the whole tyrannical dictator coming into power stuff- but fundamentally could he have become a better human being? Could he have changed? And was her departure his sign to finally cave in, or was he going to turn out like that anyway?Also the hunger games were freaking crazy I loved every second of it, favorite part of the movie. Jason Schwartzman was perfect.","

The writing and acting are so over the top, it's impossible to truly take it seriously. There are legitimately good actors in this film and they can't even come close to saving it.There's no likable characters, making it difficult to feel invested in them. Some of the production design is nice, but it's not enough to overcome all the other issues the movie has. The whole thing is a slog, the same scene repeated over and over again with slight variations. Very strange pacing.I'm truly upset that I spent $20 and a couple hours of my life to watch this dumpster fire.","

None of the films gave me something wonderful and so special that it left such an impression on me. This new release doesn't deviate much from that. It is again a very weak film that fails to develop a story in a captivating way. This actually occurs during the middle of the film, where most of the action scenes take place. The film as a whole always seems to drag on, but part 2 is much better than the rest precisely because it escapes this tiring pace that doesn't go anywhere. Part 3 is where it gets even more tiring. The film always seems to be coming to an end, but it never ends. The beginning and middle seem not to be connected with the end. It feels like you're watching two movies and it ends up being even more unbearable. There are many problems in the development of the story as a whole, especially those of some important characters. It's a mediocre film that doesn't deviate from the franchise's standards. It's not the worst, it's not the best. It is a film that becomes forgettable.","

This prequel focuses on Snow's beginnings as a humble young man who questions the methods that the Capitol uses to discipline the rebels, but throughout the film he discovers the truth about what human beings are capable of. All through his relationship with Lucy Gray hoping to regulate the methods of the Capitol. Unlike the previous films, this is a longer and more dramatic story that does not focus solely on the Hunger Games, but mostly on Snow's transmission. It is a worthy installment that serves as a prologue to the saga, even without the presence of Katniss Everdeen. It has that metaphorical characteristic that has always defined the saga with respect to capitalism, social inequality and what human beings are capable of doing by instinct. Rachel Zegler gives a spectacular performance in many ways, including her musical numbers. There is no doubt that The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a great film that revives the saga again and is a good option for those who do not know the saga to begin to enter this apocalyptic universe created by Suzanne Collins. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.","

"21","striplay","2 December 2023","We watched this at Imax last night, and it was just terrible.I don't know what I was expecting, (because I really don't like Rachel Zegler or her acting), but it certainly wasn't this.Although Zegler was unsurprisingly cheezy and awful, and although for some odd reason they made this film into a semi-musical which made everything feel awkward, I was still somewhat hopeful that the film would eventually improve..but it never did.It remained boring the entire time.Look, I genuinely like the Hunger Games over-all, but the prequel was so uninteresting, and the characters had so little chemistry or depth, or explanation, that we were truthfully almost bored to tears...and I'm actually surprised we were able to finish the film without walking out.🤷‍♂️ 🙄","

"22","simoneminotti","16 November 2023","I like the other hunger games movies, with their high and lows they were enjoyable. They were a good transposition of the books.With this one I was waiting impatiently for the end.Performances felt a little bit off, as off felt the dialogues. However the main problem to me is the lack of a central idea. It is not clear if they wanted to show a specific edition of the hunger games, if they wanted to explore Lucy and the other tributes, if they wanted to tell the story from Snow's perspective or if they wanted to explain how the modern hunger game came to life. The film it's all over the places, characters are not explored nor do they make an effort to allow the viewer to empathize with them, they're so empty and unlikable.If this is not enough they even sing. Lucy Grey straight out from the arena, after seeing the death of 24plus people is on a stage singing like a mermaid. And the singing goes on and on to the point where I can confidently sai that the last 30 minutes the film become a musical.The only likable character is portrayed by Dinklage and he dies.","

"23","ajcontre16","17 November 2023","As someone who has read the book multiple times, this is an awful adaption of an incredibly well written book. The entire movie is rushed to the point where it should have been split into two. Important characters are barely involved or completely cut out. How do you show Clemencia get bitten by the snakes then nothing of her afterwards????! No Pluribus Bell, Satiria or interactions with the Plinths... Viola Davis is a remarkable job with what she was given, but come one!!! No Hippity hoppity, not once? So much of the fear of her character comes from her craziness and it was missing.There was absolutely no chemistry between Snow and Lucy Gray. Their relationship is completely left out of the movie and that is due to the rush through of the story. Rachel Ziegler was a terrible choice for this role. She may be able to sing, but cannot act at all. Her entire portrayal of Lucy Gray was off and disappointing.The book it full of character development for Coriolanus Snow that isn't depicted in the film. You don't see the struggle he has within himself, let alone the final blow to his goodness by loosing the trust and love of Lucy Gray. This change is what makes Snow who he is later in life and why, I believe, he hates Katniss. There are many similarities between these two women and Katniss reminds him of a past weakness and betrayal. This is shown by subtle foreshadowing. Unfortunately we don't see these changes of character in the movie and that is the entire point of the book. To find out why Snow became an evil and spineless person without feeling.So many important moments were left off or changed that it was frustrating and took every ounce of self control not to walk out of the theater. Poorly done...","

"24","timeaszecsi","16 November 2023","Loved the first 4 movies, so I was very curious about this one. Honestly, I haven't seen anything this bad in a long time. The whole thing felt like a mess, was boring. Didn't even understand the singing scenes. The worst part was Rachel's acting. I don't think she was ready for this movie. She didn't do a great job in my opinion, at all. The only thing I was thinking about the hole time is her bad acting skills. She was way too much in this. I'm just disappointed. Could've been much much better movie.It's always a big risk to recreate a big hit or even follow the storyline, but man oh man.....","

"25","luhgnut","7 February 2024","Not even sure why this movie was made. Made my brain numb. Plot was all over the place. Characters you could care nothing about. Seemed like a show piece for Rachel Zegler to sing horrible songs. Everyone is a bad guy, until they aren't, then they are, then they are all plotting together to basically get to the next scene. Writing: Gawd aweful and presented with no emotion. You're supposed to ""care"" about the contestants, but you really don't. I really struggled to find any point to this movie. The writers must have just thrown the script up in the air and put it back together as they picked them off the floor. Movie has no ""bite"" to it. Supposed (I think) to show everyone means something by playing the Games only to not really play the games. Instead just avoid any attempt to win the games, that apparently, nobody is watching. Such a mess of a film.","
