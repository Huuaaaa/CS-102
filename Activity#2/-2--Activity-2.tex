

                 Just fresh out of the cinema after seeing Five Nights at Freddy's, so here's my spoiler free review for it.Now, personally, I don't find the actual concept of FNAF all that scary so I personally wasn't "scared" watching this. The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

come to life, especially when the costume design and set design are this good.If you're a harsh critic, you might HATE this film.Its biggest problems are character development overall storyline, and horror factor. (This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

PlotA troubled security guard begins working at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

Nights at Freddy's and stretch that idea out into a full blown movie. I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

security guard gets a job, and suddenly realises he's going to have an incredibly challenging and difficult night.I genuinely and desperately wanted to love this film, the trailers looked so cool, and despite not being a gamer, I knew of the game.Now, if I were judging this solely on the visuals, I'd be giving it a mammoth score, and healing praise onto it, it does look fantastic, and as for the 'locals,' they look so cool, the special effects are great, genuinely a smashing looking film, one that my fifteen year old self would have loved.Now, the important bit, the translation from game to film, I really wish I could say it worked brilliantly, I'm not sure, I think there's something missing, does the story work? Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

whimsical even sometimes satirical camp movie. I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣



                                                    I found the concept to be a bit cartoonish, so I was expecting it to be more fun. The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

recent lore and games, when I was in middle and high school, I really enjoyed playing the game especially the first three as I thought they were fun and had some fun scares. I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

Freddy's. That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.



up to most expectations. Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

                        More of a 6.5/10 imo , kind of a casual fan of the franchise but It's an enjoyable movie. Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Freddy's" is a film that seems to stay faithful to the games, especially in its portrayal of the creepy animatronic characters that capture the eerie spirit of the game's characters. Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

feelings. Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

Wonderland; and Five Nights At Freddy's.The latter two of which have incredibly similar plots.Of course, I know this particular film is supposed to be based off a popular video game (of the same name)...and not just a blatant ripoff of the previous films.Although, I've never played it myself...so don't know how true to it it is.One thing is for sure, however...this is by far the worst of the three.Mainly, because the storyline, here, is so poorly developed.Meaning that The Banana Splits Movie still reigns supreme, at the top of the list.Although, this does seem to pay- at least a little bit of- homage to both of the previous films.In regards to the former, how the little girl makes friends with the robots.And in regards to the latter, with the scene where they have the main character cleaning up the mess left by the goons (in true Nicholas Cage fashion).The main issue I have with this film, is that there is too much focus on the backstory- where I found myself wanting it to be more of a pure horror.With the whole angle about the robots "being haunted by the ghosts of dead children" seemingly thrown in out of nowhere...which just didn't jive for me.On top of that, the little girl is portrayed to be much too childish for her age.So much so, that it's almost cartoonish.While, the overall structure of the storyline just doesn't seem to gel.Every time I thought the horror was about to kick in...it just ended up being drawn out even further, to make room for additional aspects of the backstory.Which seemed to be largely unnecessary.As, it, plain and simply, could have- and would have- been better, if they focused on making it less of a drama, and more of a horror.Because, in reality...there is almost no horror in this at all!And when it does, eventually, kick in...it's incredibly anti-climactic.Which leaves you feeling like, "I sat through all that...for this?!".At the very least...it comes off as a massive missed oppourtunity.Because I really thought this was going to be cool.But, frankly...it's quite lame.So I can't help but be disappointed by the whole thing.Because this was a completely unrewarding experience.2 out of 10.

any of the games and barely know the plot. I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.

(Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

horror movie. Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

another 80s nostlgia horror flick. The plot revolves around a closed chucky cheese like restaurant from the 80s where the animatronics come to life and murder people.It's a great premise, and the film certainly sets up some interesting ideas, and wisely gives the main characer some agency. He's a down on his luck guy who after losing his family cares for his kid sister, but suffers the same mysterious dream every night. Personally, I would have found it more plausible and interesting if the dreams had begun when he started working at Freddy's which would make more sense in light of the nature of the dream and his interactions therein.Unfortunately, once the female cop shows up, the film begins to come apart. She does not act like a cop at all, being entirely understanding and way too friendly, going for a walk and sitting down with him at the river at their second meeting. Yes, this is (poorly) expained later on, but the writing of their scenes is awful.The best scenes in the film belong to the lawyer of the protagonist's aunt. He's hilarious. They set her up as a great antagonist, only to drop that entire plotline.The animatronics are well designed and sufficiently creepy, but the film shies away from violence and never really commits to being a horror film. It seems to be more geared towards kids, especially with the "fun" scenes of partying and playing with the robots, but I'm not sure it really works. Much of the acting is pretty bad (especially the cop), with the protagonist never cracking a joke and wearing the exact same facial expression the entire movie. The second half suffers some real pacing issues, but the worst part is the ham fisted exposition dump that explains the robots. The moment the mystery is solved, you can feel the film deflating as the suspense is all but gone. You instantly know how it's going to end.Matthew Lillard of Scream fame is there again and does what you expect him to do. It drags on too long, and outstays its welcome, especially once we realize the horror we were promised isn't happening.A pity. WIth tighter editing and a bit more energy to the main characer, this could have been great.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Fans of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game series were eagerly awaiting the release of the film adaptation, but unfortunately, the results were less than stellar. The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

rate way better than movies deserve. I scare very easily and absolutely none of this was the slightest bit frightening.Weak scoring, mediocre acting, SOO many plot holes, and low-tension conflict.This has less tension than a rom-com to be completely honest. I would not be surprised to learn that the script was written by a bot. Every plot point was predictable and each piece of dialogue felt like it was copy and pasted from every other movie I've seen.This was pretty much just a well-funded fan fiction. I expected much more of an adaptation of a very fun and frightening video game.It might be fun for kids, but it's not exactly appropriate because there is violence, so I'm not sure what audience they were going for... it certainly wasn't me.

part by Emma Tammi, director of The Wind. The films are based on the horror game of the same name.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) works as a night security guard at the local pizzeria Freddy Fazbear. He has to work here for five nights, but during these nights he discovers that something is wrong with the pizzeria's animatronic costumes. So he begins to learn about a dark secret.This game adaptation works better for people who are familiar with the horror game, because it contains nice references and other easter eggs that link back to the game. People who don't know the game will not really understand these things.For a game known for its jump scares, designed to frighten and further frighten players, the film strangely has almost none of these horror moments. This film sometimes seems more meaningful to younger viewers of just sixteen. For older viewers, the film is not scary and if they know nothing about the game, the film may be more unclear, or overcome separately.The location of the famous pizzeria from the game seems positive, especially for people who are familiar with it. Since most movie studios didn't use CGI for this movie, the animatronic costumes of the Fazbear crew have to be brought into the movie. Jim Henson's Orphan Shop was responsible for the Fazbear crew. They are performed by puppeteers and stunt artists. This will get her across.However, the story of the film can be a problem for viewers of the film. In addition to the story around the pizzeria, it also tells the story of the main character. In addition to a dark past, he also has a struggle to retain the rights to raise his youngest sister. These storylines do not always correspond well with each other, which means that the film can sometimes be a bit unclear and difficult to overcome.This inferior script sometimes makes it difficult for the actors to come across well. Josh Hutcherson sometimes remains a bit vague. He does come across well as an older brother who tries to take good care of his sister. His sister is played by Piper Rubio, who delivers some decent acting for a novice actress. The brother and sister actors have a well-known bond together. Matthew Lillard also plays a small role in the film, which he portrays appropriately. After his previous acting work in Scream and Scooby-Doo, it is also nice to see him again in this horror film.

First off it took 40 minutes before anything happened and the story was so forced and hard to care about. I didn't play the games because they never interested me so idk if this is supposed to be a part of the story but wow was it a terrible story. The plot was so poorly thought out and cringy with almost no horror aspects at all. I thought it was supposed to be a horror movie, which from what I understand is what the video games were, but it ended up being a mystery movie kind of. The acting is horrible and the screen writing didn't help them. The interactions between the characters are so unrealistic and their emotions are so random and extreme. One character is so unnecessarily secretive it's frustrating. I'm really sorry if you're a fan of this franchise and I know you probably really want to like this movie but be realistic about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The only reason I didn't rate this 1 or 2 stars is because the animatronics look really good, for the VERY limited time you see them.

absolute trash. Feels like a high school drama class wrote the script at a special education school. Acting is forced with weird camera angles. Whom ever green lit this project needs to be fired and sued for fraud waste and abuse. I wish you could give jail time for bad movies.I will say the only thing that I can commend this film on is the accuracy of a 90's chuck e Cheese. The set was spot on. The use a bal pit, disgusting carpet and neon lights was an exactly how I remembered. The woman who plays the cop should never work in any film ever again.

This movie was a rollercoaster. If you haven't played the games, I can understand why you may dislike or be confused about what was going on in the film. BUT! If your a long-time fan of the games (myself included) you'll love it. The cast is amazing. Josh Hutcherson as mike was a great casting choice and in my opinion, he basically is mike in real life.There's plenty of easter eggs for fans and got me looking everywhere for secrets!! While the movie isn't exactly like the games, it's faithful enough that you can recognise it as a fnaf film and not some generic horror.Long story short, if your not a fan of fnaf, this movie probably isn't going to be good to you. It can be confusing and odd and that's honestly understandable. Though to people willing to get into it or just fans in general, I can guaranteed that this film will meet your expectations and standards.

It already served as an inspiration for the much better The Banana Splits Movie in 2019.What should be a gory comedy horror movie. Five Nights at Freddy's is a more serious movie about grief and loss masquerading as a horror film.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a security guard with many issues. He cannot get over the fact that his brother was abducted when he was a kid and was never found. Mike is unable to hold a steady job, hooked on pills and has anger issues.Mike cares for his withdrawn younger sister Abby and faces a custody battle over her with his aunt Jane.His career advisor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) gets him a job as a night guard at an abandoned family diner known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Mike reluctantly accepts as he needs the job to keep custody of his sister.Only when he dozes off at work, it sort of amplifies the events leading up to his brother's abduction in his dreams. He also meets Vanessa Shelly, a cop who seems to know more about the history of the park.Then there are the creepy animatronic mascots. They come alive and kill some delinquents sent by aunt Jane to damage the diner, so Mike would get fired. The mascots later take an interest with Abby as they seem to bond with her when Mike brought her to work one day.This is such an uneven film, I though it was two different kind of movies that got meshed together. The horror parts only comes alive much later. Even then it is tame in order to be a family friendly scary movie.The similar themed Willy's Wonderland was more fun with a silent Nicolas Cage causing mayhem.

could never work out why. It looked like it was going to be terrible. I'm guessing fans of the game were creating the excitement. I went in with an open mind though hoping to be pleasantly surprised. I was not sadly. This was the worst film I have seen in 2023.First of all, the film is incredibly boring. There is almost no horror in it. There's one scene near the midway point that would be considered horror I suppose, but it was probably the most boring scene in the entire movie. I understand the film is PG-13 but come on, give us something to work with.Then you have the unbearable characters. As if the adults weren't bad enough, the film adds an unlikable child to the centre of the story. Who thought that was going to be a good idea?Then there's the animatronic "villains" of the movie. I have never seen less scary creatures in a movie before. You could put these in a Disney Pixar movie and toddlers wouldn't be afraid of them.The film is long for a horror movie, coming in at around 110 minutes, and it feels every bit of it. The pacing is non-existent. Long scene after long scene with nothing being added to the story. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked my watch.People who choose this film as their 2023 Halloween film are going to be annoyed and let down. It's safe, bland and could barely be called horror. A generous 3/10.

                                                       I know nothing of the game so reviewing it as the 'horror' film it claims to be.It's no horror film. I've seen scarier adverts.While the film has great visuals, these visuals are limited to the animatronics and half a derelict pizza place.What acting there is, is good. Likewise the soundtrack.But where it all falls apart is the paper thin plot, that is told rather than shown.First third of the movie is merely an exemplar to explain the game. The rest an extremely linear story that fails to explain itself.At no point is there any horror. Not even an atmospheric build-up.While the animatronics are good that in itself does not make a good film.I'm told the idea comes from a very popular game. No doubt these fanbois will think me a heretic who 'does not get it'. But I'm a movie-goer, not a gamer and this very poor film was at the movies.Keep in mind I'm reviewing the film, not the game.

They really brought the games to life. There were twists and oh my god moments when watching, plus there were many other themes highlighted in the film not just the pizzeria which I really enjoyed, it kept the film more real, maybe more relatable.I'd like to have known more about what happened after but I'm not too fussed with that as there most likely will be a sequel that ties loose ends.Watching this brought so many memories of me playing the games when I was young, young me was jumping in my seat, it felt like young me and present me really connected.

                       I'll start by saying I don't know much about this franchise. My review is from an outsiders prospective. The PG-13 rating really hurts FNAF here. I understand they were trying to appeal to a broader audience, but this film has no scare factor whatsoever. If it was a gorefest, it could at least add some horror elements to make up for everything else this movie does wrong. The kills are mostly offscreen/ ineffective. The plot is weak, and laughably bad in almost ever way. Especially when it comes to these protagonists desicions.The movie is a slog fest. The animatronics basically take a back seat in their own franchise, which is a shame because the look of the animatronics is the only good thing about this snooze fest.

Although it was more of a thriller than a horror in my opinion. Probably because the movie was rated a 15. It was not scary at all yet it made you feel creeped out. Vanessa being Williams daughter is a bit confusing to the games lore, as well as Mike not actually being Williams child also. It got a bit childish when all the animatronics team up with Abby to make a fort. I felt disappointed that the movie went towards that direction. I wanted a scare, but all in all the movie was not actually too bad. It was visually brilliant, with the animatronics looking spot on compared to the game, but the plot just needed quite a bit of work. The visuals were worked on more than the storyline, a big let down for someone as myself who has been waiting 10 years for the film and has been a long time fan of the franchise. I was sad to see that Markiplier is indeed NOT in the movie, but I hope to see him in the second. Although a couple of other youtubers did make appearances.

I haven't played the game but I was aware of it. However the trailer for this movie certainly looked like something I would be into! I toughed it out for slightly over an hour and had to turn it off! I was beyond bored to be really honest. It was a whole lot of repetitive, snooze fest scenes! I was expecting much more given the great cast list I am a fan of Josh, Elizabeth and Matthew. But I was very unimpressed by the movie overall. I was intrigued still with 1/2 questions which I asked someone that had watched it all for! And when they answered my questions I can truthfully say I'm glad I didn't bother to finish it! Complete waste of time.

                                          I know it's written by the creator and it's based on the franchise but it's about as scary as a Smurf baking a cake. Firstly I assumed it be broken into five nights with a simple new security guard who has more intense violent encounters each night. But it just seemed like they were trying to hard for such a great idea. No idea why it was a 15 rated movie. Seriously though it had potential and looked like an episode of Doctor Who which can be scary but I expected more. Horror movies have really gone soft since 2000 and this is no exception. I really enjoyed the directing, the characters design and the acting I was just let down by the writing and probably the studios desire to not make it 18 rated.

nicholas cage movie willy's wonderland look like a complete master piece (which it isn't) this movie consists of bad acting, flash back dreams, and some fluffy robots..\nBut for first hour or so not much actually really happens, you will struggle to actually want to watch the entire movie after being so bored already.Why is it a 15 (uk) no one really knows, a little blood here little blood there is about it.This title and any other they make will go down to the pit with all the other badly done video games to movies.It seems lately anything blumhouse touch turns to sludge rather than gold..Fans of the game will think this is a great movie for the fact is they like the animatronic figures alone but are forgetting about what makes a good movie.

had The Banana Splits Movie and Willy's Wonderland, both of which have illustrated that making a decent film about killer animatronics is no walk in the park.Similar to Willy's Wonderland, FNAF sees a newly recruited security guard (Josh Hutcherson) discovering that the mechanical attractions at a closed-down themed restaurant have a life of their own. And just like Willy's Wonderland, the film squanders any potential for a wild and gory white-knuckle ride, director Emma Tammi delivering a very tame experience that focuses more on security guard Mike's troubled past and his relationship with his young sister Abby (Piper Rubio) than it does on the horror of being stalked and killed by homicidal machines.Avid gamers might enjoy seeing the characters come to life on the big screen, but I imagine even the most forgiving of Freddy fans will be disappointed by the lack of atmosphere, thrills and OTT violence in this uninspired Blumhouse misfire.

with the games which were good the film would be very bad. The fan service made the film worthwhile. Storyline felt rushed and incomplete. The big ending one of the most impactful and significant events seemed brushed over and honestly not amazing, it felt rushed aswell as over simplified. Cameos and fan service was enjoyable but that's what they're there for. If it wasn't for them it wouldn't be enjoyable as characters motives are weak and change with little influence. The entire premise was weak with how we interacted with the animatronics.

                While the Jim Henson Company did a great job with the animatronics, they are utterly wasted and contribute no scares to the film whatsoever. The plot, so to speak, is spread throughout the runtime and is predictable at every turn.If you were expecting the movie to imitate the tone and content of the games, you'll be largely disappointed beyond a few names and easter eggs.If you were expecting decent spooks, plotting, or performances, you'll be more disappointed still.Matthew Lillard chews the scenery in each of his (too few) scenes and is far and away the standout. An anthology of shorts - perhaps tied together through Lillard's character - would have allowed for better scares and more closely resembled the source material.

The critics are such idiots for the ratings they've given this absolute masterpiece of a movie. As a long-time fan with a very in-depth knowledge of the lore and the story, this movie did not disappoint, besides the fact that it had to end!! I loved it from beginning to finish, I loved the added lore and the depth of the characters, from Mike to Vanessa to even Max. The cinematography was incredible, the sets were GORGEOUS (especially the pizzaria), the score was wonderful, acting was great even with the kiddos, and man oh MAN those animatronics. Makes me shudder knowing that they're out there, somewhere . . .Also- the jumpscares, man. I went insane every time even when I could tell that they were coming. Terrifying but in an amazing way.LOVE LOVE LOVE, and any fan will too! (:

Peacock. Simply one of the most laughable horror movies of all time. All the deaths except for one are off screen. Least that we saw since we FF it after a mind numbing hour of nothingness with only a couple of ludicrous deaths. There is no horror except of course having to watch this in a theatre. The laughable monsters are so ridiculous looking that I couldn't stop laughing. Josh is no leading man material and to see his boring countenance nearly the whole movie is unbearable. How this made so much money opening weekend is mystifying but hey I watched tons of awful movies when I was a teenager myself. There are no scares, no good effects; certainly no good deaths. I expect a precipitous drop next week in the box office. Awful awful awful.

                                First and foremost, the movie could have been far better easily. It is not an extremely bad movie, but definitely it's not a horror one. I mean, if there is no blood, there is no crime right? So, here nobody dies, Lol.Second, the script is bland and the PG-13 does not help. Obviously with a -R or +18 advice, it could have been a masterpiece. Instead the movie is more oriented to scare Tik Tok generations.Last, the cast is just Ok. I didn't know anyone before the film and after it I'm going to forget all of them. A shame.So, overall a missed opportunity to create something great, fantastic and scary. Definitely , I can't recommend to horror fans, because if there's no blood, there's no crime. Happy Halloween.

I'm pretty critical when it comes to movies but yet I still absolutely loved the movie. I do have some small complaints though, one of the complaints I have is I hoped to see more of William Afton in the movie but besides that I'm very happy with what we received from this movie. I actually understand why critics rated this movie low, and that reason is that they aren't fans of the franchise. If you have always been a fan of this franchise then you will likely love this movie, overall I'm super excited to see the second movie when it releases!

Fantasy and fun come to life with its impressive practical effects and even more impressive budget. Even so, the film gets lost when translated from its spooky, but tween friendly games. It, most fatally, completely forgets its most famous trademarks: suspense and jump scares. It should not be expected to be a work of art, but at the very least, the screenplay should not leave all of the heavy-lifting to the production team.As mentioned previously, those who produced the visual aspects of "Five Nights at Freddy's" are exceptional on ensuring that the pizzeria is how a fan would imagine it. It's dark, dusty, but also colorful. The technology in the abandoned pizzeria is appropriately dated. Additionally, in an industry so reliant on the use of CGI, it was refreshing to see Freddy and his pals as real animatronics. So much love and care were put into the world Scott Cawthon created that it stings a bit more that the film's other elements are as empty as an animatronics' endoskeleton.The plot is not as bad as it could have been, but it still never feels polished, nor fresh. It features an upsetting story about a sad protagonist, with tragedies brought up throughout. It is accurate in many ways to the plot of the third game; unfortunately, plot points are brought up repeatably without much progression in order to satisfy the nearly two-hour runtime. When plot elements demand for more substance, they are sidelined for the recurring objective put in place, resulting in an abrupt ending overall and a lack of resolution for certain parts that happen near the end. Characters during the first two acts are serviceable with some good acting, most notably from Josh Hutcherson. When the second act starts to close, the dialogue becomes increasingly wooden and the actors try their best to combat the lackluster script by conveying emotion in the tired phrases given to them.Despite the forgettable plot and uneven characters, a horror film can usually stand on two feet if it provides what they promise: suspense. This, strangely, is where the movie is at its weakest. There is not a second where one's heartrate rises, nor is there a moment to cling on to the seat in fear. The animatronics, furthermore, are too expressive compared to their video-game counterparts; this results in impressive facial movements, but a less impressive method of intimidation. Part of what made the games creepy was their lack of visual movement and their corpse-like faces. The violent sequences, however, are creative, given the fact it is appropriately aimed at younger teenagers. Gore is obscured with clever shadows, impacts are reasonably cut at the last second to not only censor, but also to keep it from appearing cheesy. When it does not remember to cut at the right time, the result is usually very silly; which could possibly be the point when regarding its 1980s theme."Five Nights at Freddy's," almost seems purposeful in its lack of creepiness as tonal inconsistencies emerge as an enormous problem. About halfway in, the film turns from a slightly unsettling adventure into a tone reminiscent of a bubbly montage found in many Chuck-e-Cheese home videos. It's inorganic, and any suggestion of a spine-chilling blockbuster evaporates at this point. It almost suggests that multiple drafts of the film were sloppily merged together. It attempts to tread back to perilous moments later on, but interest in the unfinished plot is alarmingly small by the time it gets there.With all of that said, "Five Nights at Freddy's" is better than any movie about a point-and-click game has any right to be. It is simply bothersome that it could have been drastically more enjoyable had the plot added more depth and the atmosphere remain similar to its source material. It is about guaranteed that the film will receive an endless supply of sequels, with a spark of hope that it only goes up from here. This first entry, however, does not make a good impression for the franchise going forward. If the screenwriter were to be changed for a more experienced one, improvements could be of large proportions.Five Nights at Freddy's - 56/100"Five Nights at Freddy's" may have the fantasy going for it, but the removal of scares and fun prevent it from truly coming to life.

And look, I'm generous when it comes to rating movies sometimes...so I gave it a 2. IT WAS SO BAD, don't get me wrong I like fnaf ,not like those obsessed fans though. So all the ratings you see here with like above 6 stars, they're absolutely too obsessed to even notice the cringy scenes.Hats off to the guy who made the movie trailer, that was impressive, nothing like the movie though.I'm not so hard to scare, couldn't even go past night 3 on the mobile game so when I say this was like a walk in the park, believe me. I didn't even jump once...\nDamn, I could've made a better movie... mmm... maybe someday...

Peacock this evening. The storyline centers around an older brother striving to provide for his younger sister, whom his aunt intends to adopt. He accepts a job at an abandoned establishment reminiscent of Chuck E. Cheese, only to discover that the animatronics within are far more alive than they initially seem.Directed by Emma Tammi (The Wind), the film features a cast that includes Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games), Matthew Lillard (Scream), Elizabeth Dean Lail (You), Piper Rubio (Unstable), and Mary Stuart Masterson (The Stepford Wives).This movie possesses a wealth of potential with a captivating concept, provocative settings, a strong cast, and intriguing subplots. It had all the elements necessary for a potential masterpiece but falls short of expectations. The kill scenes are disappointingly lackluster, starting from the opening credits, which could have set a thrilling tone but did not deliver. There's a distinct absence of gore, visual depictions of killings, blood splatter, or any such elements. The film's PG-13 rating is a clear limitation. It's a missed opportunity, as the atmosphere is well-crafted, and the cast delivers stellar 10/10 performances. Lillard is a perfect fit for his role, and Masterson makes for an excellent villain. Hutcherson's performance is compelling, portraying an authentic big brother dealing with inner turmoil. The ending reveal adds to the film's intrigue. However, the subpar kill scenes remain a glaring flaw.In conclusion, Five Nights at Freddy's had the potential for greatness had it pushed the envelope and embraced an R-rating for a more intense horror experience. Instead, it caters to a middle school audience. I would give it a 4/10 rating, but I still recommend watching it at least once.

                                                         I was sitting in theaters watching the flabby ford fiz gang and there was a scene where Fraddy Fizzbor Fazzed all over the screen, it really felt like he fazzed all over me and my friends (my schizophrenic medication isn't working). I loved the nude scene with the cupcake too, it felt like the frosting really went in my mouth! And at the end Oppenheimer dropped his nuke on the pizzeraria and I loved seeing the flabby ford fizzington gang get obliterated by the atomic bomb.That is why I put it at 9 stars.But honestly it was a really great movie and I would rewatch it any day. I gotta go my grandma's calling me up from the basement (my Freddy fazbear cave) to go eat hotpockets. See ya!

                                       This movie was a HUGE disappointment. Five Nights at Freddy fan or not you will be massively confused as to what is even going on. The film is very disjointed and the half assed story was poorly conveyed and extremely Cliché. If you are thrilled by the power of friendship saving the day you will love this movie. If you love a comedic PG adaptation of one of the most horrific stories of child murder and possession you will also love this movie. But if you love to watch quality movies with tonnes of care put into them, containing an original and engaging story, maybe go watch netflix instead.This film could have easily been improved if it wasn't desperately trying to target 7 year olds, despite most pf the fanbase being adults or in their late teens by now. It should have been an origin story for the animatronics, not a romantic comedy, teen, summer fun loving movie.Biggest disappointment in a while.

                      I'm gonna be honest, video game movies have been getting better in recent years. And I thought they were gonna get progressively better than they were in early ears in video game adapted movies. But I guess not all of them can be good. Five Nights at Freddy's is just another soulless video game adaptation that only wants to make this movie cash out the games. While it may have some good visuals that stay true to the games with the animatronics and the details on the pizzeria, the movie would provide a plot that relies on just Mike and his arc about his family issues ti the point of becoming predictable. I'll give the movie for trying, but the story around the pizzeria doesn't happen until the third act. Also, the movie is not as scary as you may think. In fact, the movie barely has any scary moments. Most we would get is just characters playing around the pizzeria and the animatronics interacting the one character, but not in a thrilling way. And not to mention with how the characters have been handled. Mike being the punching bag and Abby's interactions to the animatronics. And they're connection don't really affect much. I think the best recommendation is this will be for the die hard FNAF fans. After all, they have been asking for many years if there would be an actual FNAF movie, and here we are. You'll probably enjoy it. Outside of that, I don't think it would be worth a watch. It would be better to play the games instead. Actually, I even recommend the fan SFM videos on YouTube. At least some of them can have enjoyable storytelling. As for the actual movie, the only thing we would get is just disappointing and easily dull. I guess I'll just wait for Sonic The Hedgehog 3 next year. Happy Halloween.

and I haven't been able to allow it cause they're all awkwardly sexual. Finally a film that has a story line that makes sense, and isn't full of innapropriate romance scenes.The story line itself is pretty good, and the jump scares are enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting is on parr and i think they just did a really good job. My kids who love the fnaf game said there were so many good nods to the games, and were excited to watch it. All in all, a pretty good movie and a good movie for your first horror film if you're a kid.

on a slippery slope he'll fast.The main guy is such a whiny and irresponsible emo loser. He gets a job and attacks a poor guy whithout asking what was going on, then he gets another job and sleeps all night instead of guarding what he was hired to guard, and on top of that brings his sister (who btw is young enough to be his daughter) along for no other reason than to cover for him not doing his job....The dream stuff is just pure nonsense and only serves to slow the story and feels like it was a fea pages pulled from another script....just no.

played the game but have got a 10 year old nephew who is incredibly excited to see this film because he loves the characters. I have to surmise that the games involve sneaking around the diner while avoiding the menacing glare of the animatronics?To be fair most studios who try to adapt what makes computer games so successful onto the screen fail. I'm thinking of you Street Fighter 2, The Last of Us, Super Mario Brothers, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, *The Witcher, Resident Evil - the problem is that playing a game is incredibly immersive, as should be watching a film, and video games have much, much more license to take their time in getting you to bond with the character and story you're telling.I digress, massively. Basically, FNaF's is slow, boring, predictable. You do not spend any time with the monsters (hardly) and I get the feeling the storytellers couldn't decide if we, the audience, were supposed to sympathise with them, or fear them.

                                                                                                                                                                                 Either the original games' atmosphere and story were way worse than I remember them being, or this movie just did a really poor job replicating them. The animatronics themselves just aren't scary and constantly get demystified over the course of this movie, leaving only very few moments where there's actually a hint of horror left. The story, while not entirely uninteresting, still seems convoluted and only holds the movie back even more when it comes to actually being scary or creating a chilling atmosphere. This seems to me like a fine hommage to the original games, which you'll probably find some way to enjoy if you're already a fan of the series. For everyone else though, it's neither that interesting, nor scary. There aren't any interesting stylistic devices present and most moments are either completely forgettable or immediately obvious.Overall I'd give it a watch if you're somewhat interested in the franchise. It's not unwatchable, Just really generic.

I'll admit, I had a phase where I was paying very close attention to the games. I could see there was a lot more going on beneath the surface than I think other people my age wanted to understand, and I could appreciate that. I never tumbled all the way down this rabbit hole like the kids did, but I knew enough.This is a very technically competent movie but it feels 100% laser targeted at existing fans of Freddy Fazbear. There are so many parts that, for people under the age of 18, are undoubtedly big epic lore references. But the movie does not do an especially great job at bridging the gap to those a little less familiar with things. You get the broad strokes, I guess, but there are mysteries that got teased out over the course of 4-5 games that are bluntly one and done here. It's the sort of thing that's only interesting if you're already familiar with the source material.Things about it feel really contrived for the sake of having a movie. Like the fact that Josh Hutcherson is over 30, but he's the big brother to a little girl who is maybe 8 years old? Mom and Dad don't seem to be in the picture anymore because, what, Mom gave birth when she was pushing 50? Or what about the whole thing with the guy taking drugs so he can repeatedly hallucinate the day his little brother was abducted in order to uncover some sort of deeper meaning? It's pretty bizarre.Also how about the fact this movie just isn't scary? Like, at all? Even if you consider the games to be simple jump scare factories, the movie does an extremely poor job replicating that mood. It's too busy with fandom wish fulfillment to remember to be scary. I'm surprised they even bothered trying to show blood, because that is not the tone this movie is trying to convey.I'm not even sure it's worth singing praise for Jim Henson Creature Shop here, given how simple these designs are, and how deliberately stiff and stilted the characters move. Feels like a waste of talent.Honestly, as someone who used to like these games back in the day, I was ultimately pretty bored by this whole production. It wasn't necessarily offensive or anything, but it definitely was not good.

                    The story for this movie is inept. Instead of just using the idea of kid friendly animatronics going hay wire and running amok, they went with this complex paranormal murder mystery story. I get that this is based on the graphic novels and not the games lore, but that doesn't justify this movies poor plot. There's very little horror and action. The characters spend most of their time chatting and arguing. It wasn't towards the end where it started feeling the games where the animatronics turn hostile and began attacking the human characters. Mathew Lillards character Afton is a poorly written villain. He only appeared in three scenes and just pops up in the end and we're supposed to be shocked that he was the children's killer. There were no hints or buildup at all to him being the killer but the character Vanessa reveals that she's his daughter and tells us everything we need to know about what her Dads crimes right before he comes out to kill Mike. It's also worth pointing out that Vanessa's last name is Kelly and she doesn't even have the last name as her Dad. Which is why we never saw the daughter plot twist coming. It also doesn't make sense how exactly Afton has control over the children's ghosts and is able to manipulate them into killing. In his final scene, Afton realizes that he's about to get his comeuppance from the animatronics and yells out "I always come back!!" For some reason the plot tries to make Afton out to be some kind of supernatural villain who can't be killed. It also doesn't make sense how the animatronics didn't know that Afton was the killer. Mikes little sister Abby had to draw a picture to explain to them that Afton was their killer to turn against him. I also can't figure out why Afton hired Mike as the night guard for his restaurant. I thought perhaps he wanted to lure him in there so he could kill him in privacy. But if that's the case then why did he wait five nights to do it? He also berates his daughter for failing to keep everything a secret from Mike and refusing to kill him if he found out the truth. Which makes me doubt that killing him himself was his motive.

But somehow it's fun with a good back story. The core of the games is still very well represented.The brother and sister storyline is solid The whole story how the robots are being controlled was a nice spin on things. And everyone did a solid job.No doubt Blumhouse badly want this to succeed I hope it does because it deserves a sequel to carry on the story. There's a lot they could do here.Overall this was some serious fun , pure popcorn wasn't heavy on gore so no doubt Blumhouse will do an unrated cut . Megan would play well with these new friends.

But I know some kids and high school students talk about it. My young cousin who lives in Florida is a crazy fan of five nights at Freddy's . After seeing this movie tonight I say it was really awesome and crazy wild with loads of fans kids , teenagers , and young adults like myself. The story was so incredible and very wild and it did have some intense moments where one is the people got cut in half by Freddy fuzzbear, foxy really had a way with stocking her victims , chica really knows how to find ways of winning a fight . The rest of the characters from five nights at Freddy's were really awesome , scary and uh very intense robots . William who was dressed as the yellow bunny was so crazy . I hope they do a directors cut where they're more scenes and hopefully and alternate ending .

to know which audience it belongs to. It's too scary for children, too tame for people over twelve. (Here in Australia, it is rated for people over 15.) It also seems like two separate stories which don't quite mesh at the end but leave it open to possible sequels, which is what most films do these days to rake in the dollars for franchises. The story isn't fully fleshed out, leading to an unsatisfying ending.Josh Hutcherson does his best here, but is let down by a poor supporting cast with the exception of the actress who plays his sister Abby, and Matthew Lillard, who is great in everything he does.I suppose this film is good for a slumber party of tweens defying their parents. If you're outside this age group, you probably won't enjoy it.

Even with the creator involved in the process, this movie did not feel like a FNAF story, or what made the original game so fun and interesting. I do have to give "props" to the animatronics, as it look eerily accurate, but that's about where the similarities end sadly. The main story involving the main character is uninteresting, it's light on scares, the acting from the adults were very iffy (except Futterman, he always does a good job). I understand adopting a game story to a movie is difficult, but the plot is nearly nonsensical. Even if you can get past all that and at least expected a decent fun horror fest, the scariest thing was easily handled by some water and taser, and the main baddie was just a guy in a costume with a design flaw.

                                              My son was obsessed with the games back in middle school and I watched a good bit of the game play. Now as an 18 yr old saw he saw it a couple of nights ago. He had a good review so I watched it on Peacock, we both agree visually it was flawless 10/10 and if you're familiar with the storyline in the games it does follow it but adds more to it to flesh it out, also for the original fans there are a lot of Easter eggs dropped in as well as fan work such as the music came from fans, he said you could tell the true fans in the theater when a song played and half the theater cheered simply because they recognized and added it. I liked the keeping with the main story and was so so with the added bits. If you loved the games there's a lot to like but if you are unfamiliar and just are watching as a stand alone movie you probably won't like it as much. Over all he gave it a 9/10, I gave it a 6-7/10.

      I felt rough yet still wanted to see this with my sister in RPX which I'm satisfied with everything. I guess I'm one of few that loved Five Nights at Freddy's which is fine that's common with me I have I autism I enjoy a lot of movies most don't as much, plenty of my favorites are guilty pleasures. Anyways I love how this reminded me of 3 other movies Sinister which is masterful but much darker than Five Nights at Freddy's, the other 2 are Scream and Nightmare on elm street the Similarities are brilliant plus I don't know much about the video games I'm pretty sure the director perfected everything based on the games. The terror is great, story flows well, cast is superb, comedy is awesome, and to me a lot of the movie is spectacular!

standout horror film, but it ultimately falls flat in execution. Despite being billed as a horror movie, the PG-13 rating seems to hinder its ability to deliver genuine scares. The film struggles with its identity, wavering between psychological horror, mystery, and slasher genres without committing to any. This lack of direction leaves the audience with a sense of confusion and disappointment. In theory, it could have been something significant, but in reality, it ends up as a basic and forgettable attempt at the horror genre.A Missed Opportunity"

took elements from almost all of the games and mashed them all into one, in reality we didn't even put a name to a villain until at least 2016-17, there were no really edge of your seat moments, there was a few good easter eggs but the animatronics were done really well, I can at least give it that, I don't blame Emma Tammi for this, I blame the writers because something happened in that writers room and I'd like to know exactly what went down because while I know Scott had a say in this how on earth did he approve the final script? I'm sorry to say as a fan since the beginning I was rather disappointed and glad I didn't see it in theaters, this is more of a 'I've got a couple hours I'll watch it' type of movie, not very good and that's sad.

                                      I remember watching a FNAF rip-off movie with Nicolas Cage called Willy's Wonderland, and that movie was terrible but somehow the animatronics on that movie have 10 times more things to do than the FNAF animatronics itself in their own movie, i hate everything in this movie, the only time i feel like the movie has potential was only in the first 5 minutes of the film and that's including the opening credit, FNAF the movie could be at least decent if it's literally like the game, a 90 minutes fun ride in a abandoned kids place, instead we get this boring ass uninteresting backstory of our main character and it's really not working for me at all, and the worst thing is they spend way more time on the main character story than the scary FNAF related stuff, i also wasn't scared for once, the jumpscare are the most predictable and the cheapest jumpscare i've ever experienced, it have some of if not the worst movie editing i've ever watch, the way they cut one scene to another was just terrible and mostly annoying, they also really going hard with the PG-13 rating in this movie so everything related to violence looks absolutely stupid, the performance was meh, sometimes it's cringe, and overall a super boring horror movie, Five Nights At Freddy's was stupid, it is bored to hell, nothing scary, nothing impressive except maybe all the animatronics accurate design, but in terms of story it is one of the worst story to ever adapted from a game, they literally have the easiest concept yet also accurate to the original game instead they wanted to have more story, more drama which will work if the story was interesting, well in this case it was an awfully, dull, and boring story that they expand and it's fail, it's super disappointing even from a guy that was not a FNAF super fan, Five Nights At Freddy's was simply the worst movie of the year so far, and also one of the worst movie i've ever seen.

                                   Five Night at Friday's is based on the popular horror video game of the same name. It about a security guard gets a job at now abandoned "Chuck E. Cheese" place. While learn about the place with local policewoman he discovered there something sinister about their animatronics.Okay movie, but nothing special. Not worthy of a Razzie award it more of future cult following/favorite.The problem with this film is the writing. It has slow pace, too many dream sequences and personal problems than a scary movie. It is creepy but made little to no sense (unless you read the book or play the video games).It not a bad movie, it an okay flick. I think that it would have been better as streaming movie (Netflix, maybe).

                                                       The entirety of my nearly sold-out crowd seemed to love this movie. There were five different moments of full applause and cheers from the crowd. You might agree if one or more of the following are true: (1) You've played the video game. (2) You enjoy very tame/light horror. (3) You've enjoyed this new trend of "family horror" like M3gan (4 stars).None of those are true for me. I am confident that horror fiends will find it severely underwhelming. This is the kind of movie you might show to a 10-year-old who wants to get into horror movies. Just like with M3gan, the crowd was very young and there were even children.It's severely limited by the cowardly PG-13 rating. But I've liked some PG-13 horror movies, like Insidious. This one just isn't even a tiny bit scary. It didn't make me jump. The "scary" scenes amount to about 8% of this movie. The rest is fairly slow and boring.To make it worse, this movie makes no sense. You have to completely turn your brain off and not question anything. Otherwise the complete lack of logic and aimlessness of the story becomes apparent.It also has some very questionable moments and little things that made it feel off. One small example, someone uses fingers so wipe the blood off a knife, a move commonly seen by Ghostface in the Scream movies. The problem is, there's zero blood on the knife.This reminds me of a recent streaming movie with a very similar premise called Willy's Wonderland starring the great Nick Cage. That one didn't hold back, but it was a much lower quality streaming movie than this theatrically released one. I ended up giving it the same score.I didn't hate this movie. It's pretty funny and whimsical. I just really wish it was better and went all out. And I couldn't help but feel befuddled as the rest of my crowd kept going crazy at certain parts. I was sadly jealous.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/26/2023)

 When I was leaving the cinema I saw a film promotion of paw patrol and wasn't sure if I just witnessed the right movie which was supposed to be Friday night at Freddie's. The security guard spent the first 3 nights sleeping on the job. By the 4th night, he was told that there was ghosts within 5 seconds, he was okay with it and they were all laughing and dancing. Chuck in the mix of the taxi driver comedy scenes and the big giant robot getting in a cab and it was like what?! I can kind of get younger fans feeling some nostalgia but it was just dull for an apparent scary movie. The story was all over the place, some of which made no sense. Some reviews suggest tension or edge of your seat stuff, my advice to them people, never watch the ring or the grudge, you'll never sleep with the lights off again. However I will be fair some of the actors tried, not all but some. I genuinely think this movie could have been a lot better but based on some of the positive reviews, it was solely created for the true fans. If you really want to watch or have been conned by the trailer, I would advise to maybe rent on a stream platform when available.

of time. They combined the pizza complex with the Pizzeria from the first game lore and it didn't make any sense at all. Vanessa is now a cop and purple guy daughter. When she was just some unlucky Employee that got Possess by glitch trap. As someone who grew up with the games and watched everyone timeline videos about the lore, it just a shame that they weren't more Faithful to the games that we grow up playing. Glad we got to see matpat and Corey but we really need mark to be i\nthis movie too. Watch it for yourself and make your own opinion.

The audience score for this film is either artificially inflated or people just don't demand absolutely anything from films they watch now.The literal second the blonde cop shows up, I looked at my partner and stated "oh! The love interest is here!"Everything about this film is telegraphed a mile away. There is an attempt to build a sense of dread but the film shows its hand almost immediately. The video game this is based on does so much better of a job building a sense of dread.Once you see the the animatronics in full CGI glory it's over. All tension, all scariness. All the air goes out of the room and I'm like "Ah, cartoons. So Scary!"It's also obvious immediately that the ghost kids want the little girl. That the thugs the woman hired are going to quickly die. Even the cop being the villain's daughter, the big reveal, was not in any way surprising or shocking.Mr Blum, this film could've been so much better with better writing. I'm available. Lol.

With that in mind, and with much more significant interest in cinema, I approached this strictly with concern for how it would come off as a full-length feature, and as a horror feature, with its gaming roots no more than a tertiary curiosity for me. Illustrating the point, I was less interested about any faithfulness as an adaptation than I was about comparing this 2023 flick to 2019's 'The Banana Splits movie,' and 2021's 'Willy's Wonderland,' both of which work with a very similar concept, and about seeing where this fit into the oeuvre of filmmaker Emma Tammi, as by happenstance I've seen all her previous work in the genre. And still all such matters are beside the point: how is 'Five night's at Freddy's?' I had my doubts, but in every regard this is a lot of fun, and it ably delivers the genre flavors we crave; for my part I'm happy to say that I think this is actually really great!I'll say this, it's definitely not what I expected; for the different directions that this took I admit I was a little taken aback. I think the end result does struggle a bit: with tone, with cohesiveness, with pacing, and possibly with feeling a tad common for the path it does walk, while not taking full advantage of the principal imagery (and game mechanics) for which the game franchise is best known (even for an outsider like me). We do certainly get tastes of the animatronics stalking the halls of the restaurant and playhouse, and with smart use of (among other things) lighting, cinematography, editing, and stunts and effects, these scenes are meaningfully creepy and sinister. Yet this is actually the least of what FNAF pursues in its narrative, and while I'm told that the plot does draw on what I gather is the jumbled lore of the games, the various elements it weaves in seem imbalanced and unwieldy. We get flavors of straight horror-thriller, psychological thriller, and supernatural horror; the flick spends just as much or maybe even more time delving into the troubled personal life of protagonist Mike - his past trauma, his shoddy work history, his difficult relationship with his sister, and more. This is all part of a complete story, yes, but in the front end the telling comes across as confused, and in the back end it's overfull and strained as the script tries to neatly tie together all the varied pieces. However much this does or doesn't correlate to the videogame franchise, I think the film maybe just tries to do too much, and it might have benefited from some aspects having been left out.Even with these critiques firmly in mind, however, by and large 'Five nights at Freddy's' is gratifyingly sharp, and it's genuinely better than I could have hoped. It's readily evident how much care went into this from every angle, an endeavor to make the adaptation the best it could be, and to make something that could appeal to all comers. And just so: my friends who are deeply invested in the games told me that they were happy with the picture in terms of its relation to the source material; in my opinion it's solid and satisfying in and of itself as a horror picture. With the Jim Henson Creature Shop having crafted the animatronics, there could never be any doubt that Freddy and his friends look outstanding, and for that matter - not to count out anyone else's contributions, but they might well be the top highlight in these two hours. The stunts, effects, and art direction are top notch, and bring to vibrant life the aesthetics that anyone with passing awareness of the games will recognize in an instant. And while I'm not especially familiar with anyone in the cast, I'm very pleased with just how good the acting is here. Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, and even young Piper Rubio, among others, give meaningful weight and human heart to their characters and in turn to the proceedings; even as the tale oscillates between ideas, the actors serve as an anchor to help keep the title steady amidst any perceived difficulties.It's worth observing that while 'Willy's Wonderland' was an unremitting, unabashed horror-comedy romp, 'The Banana Splits movie' took a different tack and rooted those same flavors in an earnest sidelong exploration of the relationship between mother and child, and the significance of childhood innocence - while also, regrettably, lacking the utmost punch that would have helped its horror or comedy to land. I bring this up because FNAF fits rather neatly between these two spiritual predecessors: more grounded and earnest than the riotous Nicolas Cage vehicle, and boasting more vitality than the Hanna-Barbera blast. The writing team concocted an amalgamated story and a screenplay that try to split the difference between humor, violence, and heartfelt beats, and while none of these are specifically as strong as in the kindred flicks, the result is a fine success all the same, warts and all. For the genre purists in the audience, I would even argue that of the three FNAF might well offer the most pure horror experience. Employing the same finessed, delicate hand that she demonstrated even in first full-length feature 'The wind,' in 2018, or in 2021's 'Blood moon,' director Tammi swirls these facets together as smoothly as she can to keep the whole centered. The carnage may not be as visceral or heavily visualized, the emotional beats may not hit as hard, and the humor may not be as robust as we get elsewhere, yet the combination of them all is admirably sure-footed. Even if I hadn't previously dallied with Tammi's other works, on the basis of this alone I look forward to watching her career develop.For any number of reasons this won't appeal to all, and for any number of reasons it will not meet with equal favor among all. Videogame connoisseur, film buff, "casual" appreciator of fiction generally - there are a lot of ways to consider this, and there are a lot of ways it could have gone wrong (and may have, depending on one's perspective). All I know is that I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I sat in the theater, and even though I don't think it's perfect, the strength it can claim handily outweighs its faults and shortcomings. I had a swell time with this, and think it ably scratches the itch for whatever it is one might want out of horror entertainment. I really am of the mind that it's something anyone could appreciate, whatever level of familiarity with the games one might bring to the viewing experience. It's not something that wholly demands viewership, but it stands tall on its own legs, and if one has any passing interest then it's well worth checking out. 'Five nights at Freddy's' is a minor delight as far as I'm concerned, and I'm glad to give it my recommendation!

                      Five Nights at Freddy's is a great concept. A person is provided a job as a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and things become weirder each night. That sounds like a great horror movie. It's a shame this isn't remotely it.The movie is an actual slog fest that is more focused on adapting the lore, rather than being a competent horror movie. The games are notable for their jump scares and this movie only had 2 which is mind-boggling. I dislike horror movies that are reliant on jump scares but this movie would have actually benefitted if it had more because it was so boring. This movie not being scary at all, is my biggest disappointment. The plot is stupid, the characters are uninteresting, and a lot of the scenes are incredibly goofy (that fort-building scene sticks in my mind).Still, the animatronics look terrific and the set design feels like it was pulled right from the games. It is also filled with easter eggs that fans will love. The sound design is also great and can be quite unsettling. I can see fans liking this movie. However, a YouTube video talking about FNAF lore is more interesting than this.

massive let down. It starts out with some horror promise, but this quickly deflates once the main characters and story come into play. My main question was- was this written during the writers strike by stand ins because omg. What. A. Mess. The dialog and acting borders the ridiculous and then pole vaults waaaaay over it once "Vanessa" arrives on the scene. What is wrong with this character? Her lines, moods, and acting is ALL over the map! Calm and demure one second, then with her very next sentence is ready to murder. ROFL! People in our theater were laughing after every one of her completely over-the-top lines and not in a good way either. She was an absurd character with almost zero purpose other than to provide poorly written plot exposition and unintentional comedy. "If you bring Abby back here, I will SHOOT you." Comic gold offered up with complete seriousness- this line had our theater in stitches. One of M. Night Shyamalan's over the top disastrous characters would be hard pressed to keep up w/ ol' Vanessa's "acting" lol!The rest is a forgettable mess of wretched acting, boring family drama, boring pacing, a needlessly convoluted "plot", and lukewarm "horror". Honestly this felt like a throwaway movie of the week by a first time director. Nothing to offer. Josh Hutcherson's done much better and it was sad to see him in such a turd of a film. Maybe it will reach cult popularity due to its awfulness and stupidity a-La Rocky Horror, but even that'd be a stretch. Avoid it unless it's streaming and you need to numb your brain.

he was 5. He has been so excited to see this movie & as parents we were hoping it wouldn't be too gory. This was just the right amount of scary that he didn't want to walk to his room alone, but not enough he didn't need to sleep in my bed afterwards. That's a good level of scare, just enough he enjoyed it, not so much he couldn't watch it.It also was entertaining enough we were able to watch it as a family. Matthew Lillard for the parents, Josh Hutchinson for the kids.Visually the movie was flawless. & All your favorite bits were in the movie! We got to watch this the day before it came out on theaters due to streaming it on Peacock which was also really nice.Overall the entire family was impressed & hoping for a sequel that's just as good!

like to say I have never played the games but I watched the game theory videos when I was younger and thought the lore was interesting but never got too into the franchise. Despite this I genuinely enjoyed the film. The horror in the film is more like security breach where there are jump-scares but they are very predictable and not too scary. The plot is really where the movie shines, it's surprisingly sweet and had me hooked. The ending could have been better and felt rushed but thats only the real part that felt that way and everything else was great. There is so much here for longtime fans of the franchise and I think that you will really enjoy this if you love the games. "Tl;dr" critic reviews made it seem terrible when it's not that bad.

The horror was darker tone to it and it wished it went an Hard R Rated horror that way it would of made more sense.Coming out of watching the film last night, I have to say that this film does not meet the expectations that I had as a fan. It is worth saying that the film was not awful, but I had felt that it gave the impression that the script was rushed and very choppy to say the least. The film failed in the aspect that it was more focused on appealing to the general audience, however this is a huge weakness of this film, rather than sticking to the original material( which is difficult, especially it is a video game) the film feels like a huge jumbled mess of cameos. Unfortunately I was wrong. I knew that it would be very unlikely (and probably difficult) to follow directly to the lore. The movie had aspects from the lore but it just felt all jumbled together, especially the 'I always come back' scene, kind of cheesy and it felt forced. The movies storyline was rather random, bringing in two random characters which make no sense. The only good things about it was with the animatronics design and how the end with spring bonnie entering but just a heads up for those who have not watched it. DO NOT WATCH IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THE LORE, THE WHOKE AND LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS. It does not link to lore at all. The story was off track and had security breach and FNAF 1 together. Two different time periods, two ends of the spectrum literally. The acting was amazing imo, but that was about it. The "Springlock" scene was super hype at first but as it continued it was so demoralising. It was more like an PG horror back in the 70's towards early mid 80's. So, the entire theatre/streaming services like peacock was making jokes about it, laughing, and overall mocking the film because it was so childish. Most people had dressed up for the occasion but only ended up ruining it with the shouting of matpat showing and shouting over the iconic lines and just chucked them all in at random points. I respect the actors for they did amazing but the script did them not justice throughout the film and had led them to not having the praise they deserve. They went away the aspect of being able to see them and to only see how the tracing back to his dreams at those moments. The advertising and hype for the movie but shows that it had none of realism of the games have and not having all the iconic moments when they were necessary. The fact that springtrap under going the springlock with not much blood or gore and the fact that it had happened then just went over and gabbed the mask before saying 'i will always come back' and just carried on and getting dragged away. It gave no context on the pain that would have been shown. They could have stuck with the lore and not try to focus on a hidden message. It most certainly did not deliver the hype & expectations of the audience whatsoever, despite stating on news interviews that they have delivered what the fans would want, I beg to differ. There was barely any soundtrack or sounds linked to the games which might have made the experience better or might have been able to add more context for the fans to appreciate. The only noticeable sound or song which was in the film was living tombstone which only appeared right at the end. The movie had aspects from the lore but it just felt all jumbled together, especially the 'I always come back' scene, kind of cheesy and it felt forced.The movies storyline was rather random, bringing in two random characters which make no sense? Abby/Abbie (I don't know what way it's spelt) there was absolutely no point in her, making the film corny with the 'oh I see ghosts and they're my friends!!😆' trope and don't even get me started on the table scene. I get that it was just some fun and all, but it just didn't feel like FNAF. In the game lore Mike was William's son so even if that link was made it would've been better. Also random point but it would've been cooler with some gore, like an actual springlock scene or being stuffed inside a suit since those are big things in the games.Maybe I'm just being too critical but I guess I'm just mildly disappointed. I'm sure some people loved the film and fair for them! Everyone has their own opinions. I just feel like it could've been written a lot better rather than a film which was trying a little too hard to appeal to fans with the mushed up storyline, when it had so much potential. (Literally could've just watched a few game theory videos and followed that story and it would've been a lot better.) The movie did have some good things to it, like the few Easter eggs (sparky was cool!) and also the cameo appearances were cool, like the living tombstone song at the end! The Animatronics were very well made too! The actors did a good job as well. To be honest even if they did make a sequel, I'd still watch it. I'll always love FNAF and just hope that if there was another movie it'd be better.The end of the day, I hated when we get like off screen kills just a plan shadow, it does frustrates that intention, Willy's Wonderland was a better film because Nick Cage does not use dialogue in this film only screams and yells, The Banana Spilts Movie was similar because animatronics was designed differently and when the computer system was created an demonic animatronics then it did have on screen kills. If you really want to watch something without dialogue watch Willy's Wonderland (Skip Five Nights AT Freddy's). If you wanted to watch something that talks about the last performance with animatronics and a demonic computer hack system and went on a decent path, watch The Banana Splits Movie (Skip Five Nights AT Freddy's). This is a 3/10 it's not like I hated the movie with hot relish and/or two hours lost it did however have positive factors but nothing that would make me feel enjoyable.

trailers or a lot of promo material and just was fantastic. I loved the attention to detail in this from the smallest of nods to how the animatronics are actual working ones instead of CGI to how well the cinematography was. Saw this in Xtreme Screen and it was so worth it. Took two of my friends to see it with me and it was the same reaction. I would say if you know the basics of the game you will love this, but if you have no clue about them, maybe give it a skip. Once the credits started to roll, hand were clapping, because of how great this was.

It follows the storyline to the original game almost exactly, and the acting is phenomenal! I really liked the work they put into this film, and including a lot of background scenes about Mike. Jump-scares are incredibly done, and the animatronics are terrifying! The overall plot of the movie was well maintained, and had me on the edge of my seat for the whole length of the film. Very little CGI was used, really bringing the animatronics to life. For diehard fans of the original game released back in 2014, the movie set, from my observations, was exact! Fantastic film overall, 10 stars!

                                                               I have been a massive fan of the games watching every theroy i could get my hands on for the last 9 years\nand i was really excited to finally get some things answered\nthis movie does answer some things but it really doesn't if you're a fan of the games you kinda already expect the story to go exactly when it does and it falls so flat on its delivery of ground breaking plot reveals this movie thinks it has\nthey ruined the animatronics they had them building forts and laying down under the stars with our main characters\nthe acting is piss poor ngl\nall and all i went to see this with my girlfriend and she hasn't ever played the game but she was so bored we kept waiting and waiting for it to get good and it never did near the last 15 mins they gave us a bit of fan service and things fans of the games will be happy baout but like i said it fails to really hit home on its reveals and "wow" moments in my cinema people clapped and it made me very mad that movie didn't deserve the claps it was getting\ni walked out of the cinema legitimately depressed i was so disappointed we waited 9 years for this movie and it failed to deliver on everything the only thing they got spot on was the visuals the setting and everything looked incredible but this movie it falls flat on everything else no matter if you're a die hard fan like me or a causal movie goer like my girlfriend\nskip this one trust me\nit's just a huge disappointment and you will walk out disappointed skip this one.

with its visuals and intrigue. However, when I reached the end of the film, I truly couldn't believe how poorly they concluded it.First of all, the makeup, costumes, and visuals were quite good. But apart from that, the other elements were not satisfying at all.I couldn't understand why they tried to commercialize the script. The idea of finding children's spirits inside robotic monsters was just unbelievable. Also, the character Vanessa, who didn't do her job throughout the film but was only involved in the events because her father was in charge, really dragged the film down. Let me first address what I initially mentioned. Whoever came up with the idea of searching for his brother in a dream and communicating with the child spirits inside robotic monsters did a really bad job. Instead of turning this into more of a detective thriller and strengthening the family drama (now I'm moving on to the second point, Vanessa), they gave Vanessa's character a very simple and elementary-level script connection to her father, William Afton. The absence of police in the events or the incomplete presentation of any mystery element is a total disaster for the film. Like I said, if they had turned this material into a detective-style thriller, they would have created a much stronger film.In short, the movie,although visually beautiful, was ruined by an unsuccessful script that tested my patience and tried to be meta but couldn't. You can see this from the ratings on all movie review sites. Our time is precious and this movie is not worth it.

First of all, the costumes and the set were great, I didn't have any issue with the acting (big fan of Josh and Matthew) and it was amazing to see the game kind of come to life on screen. I understand that one has to make some modifications to the original source, but I feel like the reason why movies or series made of loved videogames fall short is because they very often become so different from the original source and either add or change story lines that don't require any change, which just makes it weird for the viewer if they happen to be a fan.I think producers and directors should have learnt from the last of us adaptation, since it's one of the most well received adaptations like this. When you make this kind of content for the fans, use the source they already love. I'm probably going to see the second movie if they do end up making it, I'm not gonna lie, because I love the games and I wish the next one would be catered towards the fans who have waited years for this sort of a movie.I think the movie is still worth a watch, esprecially if you go into the movie expecting more of a humoristic spooky movie, don't really care about the details of the games and just want to see the animatronics come to life, I'm sure you'll enjoy it more! I just might have had a bit unrealistic expectations and the hype around the movie got to me.

watching in some anticipation.It doesn't take long before you realise this film doesn't know if it's a horror, a ghost story or a suspense thriller (and nor does the audience)As predictable as a Scooby Doo Cartoon (complete with the actor who played shaggy in the film)It ruins the good start with lots of WTF? Plot holes.The big failing is using writers who clearly think the audience are idiots. Who won't ask silly questions like 'how did 5 bodies and all the blood and gore get cleared up? Or this was portrayed as supernatural now it's become mechanical - which is it.The writing is lazy and glib, throw in a nasty auntie because they can't think of any more credible reasons for X and Y to happenIt starts off respectably enough but you soon realise it's garbage . Shame as I think the storyline had real potential.Seeing many of the 10/10 reviews 'best film ever' from first time users confirm my suspicions that reivews are paid for or bogus or both.

In these phrases there is nothing recognizable from the original series, except perhaps the animatronics themselves, as if this film is trying hard to seem like canon, but it's not him. And judging by the introduction, I can already say that this film will be a weak thriller of category B for the young target audience of fnaf, BRAVO SCOTT!!It was once a horror, but it became a children's entertainment, because it is more profitable to work for a children's audience...The ending where Steve Raglan (William Afton) dies from spring locks in a springbonnie suit is literally taken from Scott Cawton's 2017 book silver eyes, but unlike the book version, where the suit slams shut because he was pushed away by the main protagonist Charlie, whom he took hostage, then in the film spring locks are triggered from for the fact that an animatronic cupcake jumps on Springbonnie, biting off part of the belly of the suit and touching these springs...... What a cringe......The villain himself, William Afton, did not seem interesting to me from the word at all, an ordinary sadist. For the children's audience for which this film is designed, it may work, but as a character it is empty and simplified.The costumes, especially the Springbonnie costume, look worse than many fan cosplay costumes. I mean, William Afton's suit looks bulky, carelessly made, as if the designers did not even try to make a nice costume design, and the material from which it is made looks like some kind of sponge.The pizzeria itself, especially the office, has absolutely no atmosphere of the first part, and looks cardboard. In fact, everything in this movie looks hastily done. As if the creators abandoned this project for years and after a long time decided to make a film with the most simplified story and collect money from the youngest audience.I'm not waiting for a sequel or prequel, because as a true fan of the series, I don't want to suffer seeing how fnaf buries itself deeper into the grave. Not that I expected some very atmospheric and dark thriller with a very charismatic film adaptation of William Afton, but in my opinion it turned out to be the worst option.

                                    Creating a story in the context of a franchise like FNAF should have been a relatively straightforward task, given the rich lore and established characters. However, it appears that the creators managed to falter in significant ways. While the visual elements of the movie, such as the scenery and costume designs, were commendable to some extent, these superficial aspects should have been just the tip of the iceberg.The fundamental issue lies in the mishandling of the established lore and the names of the characters. FNAF already possesses a complex and intriguing backstory, and it is disappointing to witness how the film failed to honor and expand upon it in a meaningful way. Instead of capitalizing on the well-established universe, the creators appear to have disregarded it, leaving fans and enthusiasts deeply unsatisfied.Vanessa's character, purportedly intended to lead a suspenseful narrative, was one of the movie's glaring disappointments. Her portrayal lacked depth and substance, rendering her unable to effectively carry the weight of the story, ultimately resulting in a dramatic failure.Additionally, the movie's pacing left much to be desired. A well-constructed horror narrative relies on a careful balance between tension and release, but it seems that the film failed to strike this equilibrium. The result was a viewing experience that felt disjointed and lacked the necessary buildup and payoffs expected from a FNAF adaptation.In conclusion, it is regrettable to witness the mismanagement of such a promising concept. While the visual elements demonstrated some effort, the core elements of storytelling and character development fell far short of what the FNAF franchise and its dedicated fanbase deserved. The film's shortcomings raise questions about the decision-making processes involved in its creation and the missed opportunity to create a compelling addition to the FNAF universe.

A comedic horror film with killer robotic animals. It's like chucky cheeses murder style!!!! Well I hate to say this but, this movie isnt how I expected it to be! Everyone in this film was good with performances! Some moments are just plain stupid. For my personal opinion, It's an unfunny, non scary, horror film that tries too hard to be scary and funny! It's good for younger people bc it's not intense but this movie was flat as anything for me and extremely boring. I feel bad for the actors bc trying to be scared of robotic teddy bears and crap is RIDICULOUS!

 This movie has all the feelings of a great idea but with no conviction. As a horror movie it sucks big style and as a comedy it isn't much better. The actors act like they just want a pay check. There are some "scary scenes" but they just aren't scary, they are predictable. You will not be jumping out of your seat to this film. I want to say something good about it but there is just so little. The whole movie just has an air of cheap new actors and old has beens. It is also way too long for a movie of this appallingness. 88 to 91 minutes would have sufficed but they made it 110 minutes for no obvious reason. Just an extra 20 minutes for the poor punter to endure. My advice is to just not bother....you will thank me for it in the long run.

                     This movie put me to almost to sleep. The main character was asleep for half of the movie reliving the same dream which is boring. The cop lady was saying the weird things. She said she can't help him but yet come and saved his ass without even struggling with the fact that the person he was gonna have to shoot is her dad.The main character said at once point that the cop was scared in the back room when they were there cause he saw it in her eyes but yet the actor didn't look scared at all.Feel like all of the plot points ended in a weird way.For example aunt wanting the girl for money. It ended by having animatics kill the aunt then try to take the girl.The plot overall was boring, weirdly done and not in a good way.

you have zero knowledge about the games this is a nice watch (if you don't think much), however if you do it will be both confusing an disappointing (Do still watch it though),Firstly, all the characters and family relationships are really mixed up, all of William Afton's motives for killing children is gone. For some reason Vanessa is William's daughter instead of Mike, who had his younger brother Garrett (supposedly CC) kidnapped (what?!?) and is taking care of his sister Abby (who?!?). What I mean is fnaf has very (VERY) deep and confusing lore, but the writers had Scott to ask questions, there were a lot of good stories opportunities about what is already known about the stories (like following mike going from restaurant to restaurant, etc).Even if you don't know the franchise, there are a lot of plot holes, like the five children are in the animatronics (freddy, bonnie, chica, foxy, and I guess cupcake?), but where did Garrett go? Why are some children in animatronics and other not. Also, why would William want to employ Mike? He had no reason to kill him, is it just for fun orrr???I enjoyed the movie, the acting is nice and its well filmed, it isn't scary, but it's not bad. It went above my expectations (they were really low), except in that one scene where the animatronics are all laying down in the "tent", that was the only real horror in the movie... Anyways, I think Mike is a good character, but Vanessa is useless and only there for exposition and "HE IS MY FATHER!!!".I say watch it and make your own opinion about it.

they should combine the 2. Why? I have no idea. Perhaps they saw the Nick Cage movie and decided they needed to keep elements of the game in it.The book itself is really good, from the child killer to the possessions, to the main girl's backstory. But they removed it all to fit in a main character who is a security guard for 5 nights (like the game).They kept the elements of the book with the serial killer and instead of a female lead with a tragic loss of a brother, the security guard has that. It's interesting how they decided to play it.All in all it's not perfect, but it isn't bad. I think the picture drawing parts were weird...and the jump scares were cheap. I will say the ending of the book series is awful, so this is a nice compromise.

                                       I usually like the cheap and cheerful Blumhouse movies but this one properly sucks. A really terrible story that is totally pointless and feels like it was made up in the fly, terrible dialogue, cheap special effects and worse of all its not at all scary, how this got a 15 certificate I'll never know!! I was happy to see Matthew Lillard get a big screen movie as it seems like ages since I've seen him In anything, after this I think it'll be a while before he's back on our screen, awful performance. This is the worst film I've seen in ages and the first one I actually considered walking out of. This film is soooo bad it should have been shown at thanksgiving. Do yourself a favour and avoid this turkey.

                                                                                                                                                                                               It was fine until exactly 1 hour and 10 minutes, when the generic exposition cop woman randomly threatened to shoot the main character for no reason whatsoever. Until then I was like "this is fine - fan service, a predictable insertion of tons of female characters because it's the 2020s, a kids rating, so no violence, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad, so overall - nothing too surprising or bad."But yeah, the cringe factor got cranked up so hard in those 5 seconds that I legit stopped watching it, because I lost all interest, this is bad. I should've expected it to be cringe and misandrist considering it's proudly directed by the same woman who made M3gan, I guess, but I did expect some competence.But yeah, overall, it's a really bland and generic movie based on a game that had no lore whatsoever until a youtuber pulled some out of his rear end for views, singlehandedly creating some (bad one).That same youtuber also has a really corny cameo, I guess for the kids to cheer over, but... yeah...Cringe.To be fair, though, the visual presentation is great, and the acting is surprisingly good, at least from the main guy. He goes above and beyond with what he gets to work with - a silly movie with a ridiculous plot - but he carries his weight and shows a great range of emotion throughout. Too bad his efforts were wasted in a movie this bad.

As a big fan of the original games, I approached this release with great enthusiasm, hoping for a bone-chilling, suspenseful experience that would do justice to its gaming origins. However, much to my dismay, this cinematic endeavor left much to be desired. Despite a few redeeming qualities, I regret to say that the final product only deserves a 4/10 rating.The film, directed by a promising newcomer in the industry, had the potential to be a horror masterpiece. The premise, which centers around a security guard surviving nights at a haunted animatronic-filled pizzeria, was ripe for suspense and terror. Sadly, it fell flat in execution, leaving me longing for the scares that never came.One of the biggest disappointments of Five Nights at Freddy's was the lackluster character development. The film introduced a cast of intriguing characters, from the tormented security guard to the mysterious animatronics. However, their potential was squandered, and we were left with underdeveloped, two-dimensional figures who lacked depth and personality. We needed a reason to care about their fates, but it never came.Moreover, the film's pacing was sluggish. While the games are known for their slow-building tension, the movie felt like an interminable waiting game, much like the protagonist's nightly vigil. Instead of suspense, we were subjected to long stretches of monotony, punctuated by occasional, tepid jump-scares that failed to evoke the heart-pounding fear we hoped for.Speaking of jump-scares, this is where the film truly faltered. The jump-scares were lukewarm at best. In a horror movie, these moments should be used to jolt the audience out of their seats, leaving them breathless and terrified. Unfortunately, Five Nights at Freddy's seemed to mistake repetition for effectiveness. The animatronics' predictable and lackluster appearances drained the film of any shock value. It was a missed opportunity to genuinely scare the audience.The film's lack of innovation in its presentation was a significant letdown. While the source material is known for its unique and eerie atmosphere, the movie failed to capture that same sense of dread. The pizzeria, a central element of the story, felt uninspired, and the film lacked the creepy ambiance that made the games so unsettling. The creators could have drawn inspiration from the games to create a more immersive and visually arresting experience, but it felt like a wasted opportunity.Five Nights at Freddy's also suffered from a disjointed and incoherent narrative. The film hopped between different time periods and perspectives, leaving viewers confused and detached from the story. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to cram too much of the game's lore into a single film, resulting in a messy and convoluted plot. It was difficult to invest in the story when it lacked cohesion and clarity.The film's visuals, while decent, failed to stand out in the crowded genre of horror. The animatronics, despite being a central element of the story, looked more comical than terrifying. The use of practical effects was commendable, but their execution left much to be desired. A sense of eeriness and uncanny valley realism was missing, leaving a significant void in the horror department.One aspect of the film that did shine was the soundtrack. The haunting and discordant score created an atmosphere of unease, which was one of the few elements that managed to maintain the tension in certain scenes. The music, composed by a talented artist, was a testament to the film's potential, but it alone couldn't salvage the entire project.In the end, Five Nights at Freddy's was a missed opportunity in the world of horror cinema. With the right direction, character development, pacing, and innovative presentation, it could have been a genre-defining masterpiece. Unfortunately, it fell short of those expectations, delivering a lukewarm experience that left me yearning for the true terror and suspense that the source material promises.In conclusion, the film was a disappointment to fans of the game series and casual moviegoers alike. It lacked the necessary elements to make it a compelling and truly horrifying experience. With a more skillful adaptation, it could have been a standout entry in the horror genre. However, as it stands, Five Nights at Freddy's deserves a 4/10 rating, reflecting its inability to fulfill its potential and deliver the scares that audiences were hoping for.

paid to watch. No plot, no intense scenes, no horror scenes. Everyone in the movie has no common sense and the little girl is literally a moron. The little girl becomes beasties with the animatronics, how stupid. Average acting. He man lives in a good house but is broke. They had some humor but it was short lasting. The plot of the movie too its sweet time developing. The movie is so low and the movie it's even focused on the robots and the original lore. If you are a five nights at Freddy's fan, do not waste you time and money on this movie.

fans of the games and absolutely nothing for those who aren't. I can genuinely not see any reason someone might enjoy this amateurish nothing burger of a movie other than because of a knee jerk positive reaction to seeing matpat or Freddy fazbear or the other animatronics on screen. Just a movie pumped out to grab some extra dollars for the owners and film companies by capitalizing on a name that will be forgotten as soon as it leaves theatres. I'd skip this one, it is not worth your time no matter what you think of the games or the property.

It started off strong, but then got lost when trying to implement horror elements. The result is an underwhelming and half-baked "horror". Despite being lackluster, the film is still worth a watch as it does not fail to entertain. Due to the silly nature of shots, scenes, and acting, you will be sure to forget that it is not a comedy flick. The acting performances were less than stellar, sad to say that includes Matthew Lillard. The film has its charm, and is sure to become a cult classic in the following years. All in all, it is a campy comedy and technically a horror, albeit hindered by its pg13 rating.

Every fan will love it. This was worth waiting 8 years to be honest with you guys. I loved the movie, the comedy and horror were well mixed and that ending was amazing. The whole movie was just great and you all should watch it in theaters as this is the perfect movie for Halloween this season. It will definitely become another horror classic. The Animatronics were perfect just as the cast was. Everyone fit the role perfectly and brought the heart to the movie, the set design was also greatly done. The music fit every scene and was perfectly done\n10/10 will watch it again.

The music was also decent though it isn't really in the movie a ton. The shot composition was pretty good and there were some pretty good looking shots, they definitely got creative with it. The sets were also pretty good they definitely sold what they were going for.However that's where most of my praise ends and I think the other stuff in the movie plunges it into a negative score. I think that they could have made the movie scary, there definitely were attempts at being scary but none of them really amounted to much and sometimes they were just comical. For example when Bonnie kills the old guy with long hair sometime into the movie the shot is composed as if it were a joke, like a bit about a guy who doesn't know that a thing is behind him, now if this was supposed to be a joke I'd say it was a bad place to put it but the only reason I think it might have been a joke is that the movie seems to be self aware about how not scary it is, when the bad ballon boy jumpscare happened I thought it was very dumb, then they did it twice and I was really confused and then in the post credit scene they do it again but as a joke, which makes me think that it was always supposed to be a joke but in the first 2 scenes where they do the jumpscare it seems to be to put you on edge so I'm not exactly sure what they were going for.I am also am very mixed about the characters, the main lead is fine, he doesn't have much of a personality or any interests outside of the plot and doesn't really feel like a person in any way and that's not helped by the actor just not doing a good job, he's pretty monotone for most of the movie but when he's supposed to be worked up he felt very reserved. His sister I have less to say about, she is a child character in a modern horror movie she's mostly there to be a plot device and it goes without saying that her acting is very not good. Vanessa is a white woman unsurprisingly, she's written a little odd but that might be on purpose and she does feel a bit shoved in at points but she's fine and her actor is also doing a fine job. William Afton is kind of interesting because he isn't completely new and is very different from his in game counterpart and I really don't like him here, from his first line he definitely seems off and they kinda lean into you kinda knowing that he's the yellow rabbit but unfortunately we can't really see much of him at all because I'm guessing Mathew Lilard was too much money for him to actually be in the movie because he is in two scenes on two sets one where he's trying to act normal but failing and the scene where he dies which is extremely lame and tame compared to the game or even some deaths in this movie I could probably go into more detail about the stuff I don't like about this William but I can only comment so much on a character that's in the movie for 5 minutesI also feel like the way they changed the plot from how it was in FNAF one makes some things less interesting, like how the pizzeria is abandoned instead of in the games where they are usually open and the night guard is there for what feels like an actual reason, the reason there's a night guard feel more contrived and it also disallows any scenes of the pizzeria in the day which I guess allows them to save in budget because they'd have to hire a ton of extras but it effectively removes some of the interest that was present in the games having to do with how this haunted pizza joint was also a semi popular spot when you aren't there. There are also smaller things like the animatronics stuffing people being removed and replaced with a Freddy mask "SAW" style contraption which I'm guessing is to keep the pg-13 rating since the the shoving and mincing into a bloody pulp implied in the game might be too far but they could have tried to circumvent it in a way similar to that of the "Freddy eats a chicks upper half of the body scene" which was just kinda silly and plays into my next complaint which is that the way the animatronics act sometimes feels like they are discarding the way animatronics are supposed to be possessed and not actual ghosts like in the games, the whole showing kids instead of the animatronics thing really made somethings feel less impactful since they essentially humanized the animatronics really early into the movie which makes them less threatening as a result and makes the movie fall into the creepy kids cliche. There were also things like foxy teleporting to kill someone which was really weird and probably would have been more scary if they made him run at the guy like in FNAF 2.The pacing also felt really off even though the actual plot is fine enough. There is a ton of time spent toward the beginning on very slow scenes that are more supposed to flesh out characters and start the plot which is fine but it feels like it keeps this momentum until the 2nd act ends. It is just slow and that would be fine but they really decided to put the pacing into hyper drive for the third act because it really goes by like road runner which would be fine if the movie was more fast paced before that but it isn't which gives a feeling that they should've given more time to flesh out the ending instead of having a slow pace for the entire movie and then the ending feeling underdeveloped.Overall I wanted to like the movie but there are just so many baffling decisions made that make it not good.

The movie, CONCEPTUALLY was so good. Having played FNAF since it first came out in 2014, I was so excited to see the adaptation for the movie 9 years later. If you are like me, DO NOT get your hopes up.The movie plot had potential, but was boiled down to a cheesy thriller that had maybe four or five callbacks to the incredibly extensive lore that Scott Cawthon established over the years with the Five Night's at Freddy's game series. I believe the PG-13 rating suits it perfectly- very VERY little gore, no drugs, no drinking, etc. So, if you are watching for the story-line alone, I would say it's not a good watch for you unless you are a younger teenager looking for a fun thriller with a few scary scenes.The visuals, however, were INCREDIBLE. Truly, I could not imagine a better real-life interpretation of the animatronics. You can look up the animatronic pictures online and get a good feel of how amazing they are. Not sure I would recommend the movie for the visuals.Overall, Five Night's at Freddy's is an incredibly below average thriller film with phenomenal visuals. The plot barely scratches the surface of the lore behind the entire game series. Not worth the watch.

The pixelated moment with springtrap in game was a lot scarier than the live action scene, how is that even possible? It felt like a kids movie. Very very disappointing as I have been waiting for a FNAF movie for sooo many years now. After the movie ended, everyone at the cinema just left quietly with no applause, screams of excitement or even a happy face even tho there were a lot of fans. They just made a cliche horror movie with the animatronics: little kid drawing, talking to imaginary friends and nobody believes her etc. The movie was about some family drama not about surviving the night. The security guard was pretty much in no danger and he was sleeping all the nights and dreaming about the kids. There were not even any doors that he would have had to close if they get too close. It was literally a night guard duty job with nothing happening other than bad dreams... Later on he brought his sister there as there was literally no threat there and she wanted to go. There was even a scene where the animatronics were building a chair fort together and being best friends... I had no idea FNAF could be so unscary even tho the animatronics were very well done. In the very end they became dangerous to them but you really couldnt care less if anyone died and the animatronics just werent even a bit scary anymore. They also tried to put some lame jokes around for no reason. Knowing how disturbing, scary and unique the original games are im just wondering why they decided to make it a cliche "horror" movie that has been done a million times already. Nothing made sense. They could have made such an awesome movie with the concept of the games like having the guard trying to piece together whats happening, checking the cameras, having to save power and actually surviving... They could have had some scary flashbacks as he is figuring out what happened and showing the horror that the kids witnessed and went through and getting more insane knowing he might suffer the same fate. Could have been such a terrifying horror movie perfect for halloween and for fans but nah... I am extremely sad to leave such a review but its just the truth.

                                FNaF is a goofy parody of Chuck E. Cheese which took campy horror themes and made a fun and scary game. This movie shifts the tone to a serious family drama, which removed pretty much all fun and comedy from the story. Small jokes are made tongue-in-cheek and we laugh at some common painful experiences we've all had, but overall, it missed the vibe of the game. Another version did a better job of referring to the game and its elements while translating the campy element of the game into campy movie elements. It may have been simpler, but it was closer to the games.. Honestly this movie was more like Doctor Sleep. I'll probably rewatch the Willie's Wonderland movie to get the taste of this one out of my mind.

say other than that I haven't seen a video game adaptation this bad since Paul W. S Anderson's Resident Evil series. I don't really want to fill this entire review bubble up but I would HIGHLY suggest avoiding the theater for this one, it's a mess and a big one at that. It has way too many plot holes and pacing problems that it's unbearable to sit through- the acting from Hutcherson and Lillard is good, but I cannot say the same for the rest of the cast whatsoever.Incredibly underwhelming and worst of all: not scary, whatsoever. This film's tone was back and fourth and I couldn't believe what I was watching for nearly forty minutes.As far as adaptations go, it's bad, and I mean really bad. It's own story felt completely rewritten by Hollywood executives and not Scott himself, and it's just disappointing to such an extent that it's hard to imagine Scott even had a hand in any of this whatsoever because I couldn't imagine him being ok with the final results.Of course there's the PG-13 issue but this is something I somewhat anticipated (the games were never hyper violent nor gory, just dark material as far as storyline goes) but it's held back so much by dropping the violence in favor of weak jumpscares- it's disappointing to say the least.I dunno guys, I couldn't recommend spending nearly $12 to go and see this in the theaters- luckily we caught this on Peacock but it's really not worth admission for what you're expecting. Is it cool seeing the animatronics? Absolutely. Is it frightening and dark like the games were? Nope. Is the story just like the games? Nope.Look, take it as you will but it's just not worth your money. It's disappointing and I think the best part out of it all was Corey and that's all I could gather from it.

If the acting had more heart and the storyline was better written. It was cliche after cliche. Can't writers come up with something new, ever? It's like there's not even a need for writers anymore because they all tell the same story in one way or another. It's incredibly monotonous having to watch the same thing being told over and over. I guess they say around and said what can we take from every movie ever and throw it together in a poor fashion. I gave it 3 stars for the cinematography and the special effects. Don't waste your time, you've seen this before.

                                                              This movie is lame as hell. Super slow and boring. No gore. No nudity. A few weak jump scares that you can see coming from a mile away. The acting is terrible. Two hour long movie felt like five hours. The story is unbelievably cringe. The robots look cool but they don't really do anything other than standing around. If you have a child or a newborn infant then I would recommend taking them to see this lukewarm, fake horror movie but don't expect to be scared or even feel anything at all. The aunt is a hideous hag that barely looks human. The son is a demented little weirdo that never stops whining. The only good actor is the guy who plays the pharmacist. He nailed his lines. Anyone who is scared of this film is most likely faking it just like that idiot did with the game to get views on YouTube. Save your money and buy a hamburger or a hotdog instead. This is an abomination.

worried, but don't listen to them! This is a movie for the fans and for those who want to have a good time. Not only is this about Freddy's but it has a storyline that attaches itself and makes sence into why the MC needs the job.Some Easter eggs thrown in there that were fun to spot\nYou can definitely watch this without knowing the lore or being a huge fan as it explains itself\nThere were moments where it was slightly scary in the sence you were on edge but this isn't very gory horror, ofcourse there were scenes but this isn't a saw like gore movie so don't expect to see full on gore.However there were some scenes which did get me I'll admit.There was no way to capture the scare of the games as horror games are more scary than films in my opinion and the games are first person so it's not like you're there playing it ,but it's definitely an enjoyable movie based around the first game and I'd recommend a watch!(Stick around after the credits)

I'm not a fan of video games, so I've had no idea what this movie was going to be about. I didn't even know that was based on a video game, if I knew I would probably just skipped it.I thought it was going to be like that movie with Nicolas Cage something Wonderland, but then it reminded me of another one with the Banana Splits that was supposed to be horror. I don't remember their names, but I'm sure they made more sense than this one.One thing is boring, but this was boring and stupid.Can't care less about a sequel tho it seems that there's going to be one.

haven't played them all that much, was always high on my list for top scariest games I've ever played. So this movie should be right up my ally right? Well not in this case. The movie focuses on hitting that feature film length so much that you get a jumbled story with so much going on that the movie ends up just leaving you behind. Oh and Animatronics we're great for the 5 minutes they were on screen.The characters are not interesting at all and that's a shame because we are stuck following the main character Mike through un interesting repetitive dream sequences that lead to nothing. The others acted in such an non human way, it throws you out of the illusion.This movie had a story already written out that scared so many people already, why they didn't just stick to that and flesh out the already told story is beyond me. They need to tone it down and stick to what they already have if they plan on doing anything else with the franchise.

     As a fan of fnaf, I didn't mind that the movie kinda broke out of the lore. But it wasn't a great movie. The writing felt lazy, the characters were just fine, there wasn't a whole lot of tension. The whole thing just felt fine, which is weird to me because the cast was great and the animatronic suits were really impressive. The sound design was kinda bad in my opinion, but something that I actually really liked was the lighting. The scenes felt super empty and lifeless, like the places around them weren't real, and even in scenes with extras it felt dull. The movie just fell flat. I'm genuinely happy that so many people enjoyed it, but I feel like you can make a movie that's a love letter to a series and still a good movie on its own.

only this movie is really bad.Nic Cage's movie was fun and gory. This movie is downright dumb. I have zero knowledge of the video game, but I had a hard time following the plot.Mainly because it's a very, very, very boring movie. The entire first half has no action. Then when the action clicks in, it's disappointing.The writing is really poor and the direction worse. I can't say much about the acting because the actors don't have much to work with.Frankly, I was shocked at how much this looked like Willy's Wonderland! Only no where near as good.

Screening.I was Interested throughout Some of the Film, but after a while, I realised that it's just a Dull Film but I continued watching.The Plotline was there, the Soundtrack was there, the Horror was kinda there in a Couple of moments. But the Director just Couldn't Pull it all together Effectively.And then you have other problems with the film -1. 👎 The Lead Actors Performance is just not good enough to lead a film.2. 😶 (is this Horror at the level of Tweens and 13 & 14 year olds?) There were a couple of half decent Horror moments, but then it just Dissipates into thin air.🙇🤷3. 🐻 The Plotline, I liked the Plotline, but again it's a very ehh execution, it's ehh leaning into a dull execution.4.🐰When the Rabbit takes the mask off, whatever interest I had left in this film(which was already evaporating by the Minute) was completely extinguished after that.5. 🎬 The Director just Couldn't make the right choices and get this thing Firing on All Cylinders.Overall, Five nights at Freddy's starts off with interest and then it's just an egg timer ⏳ of losing all interest and losing whatever Horror Element the film had in the First Place.

I've been a Fnaf fan since day one when I was only 14, now I'm 23 and I waited years. I knew I was going to be disappointed but this movie doesn't work on any level. As a stand-alone movie it's just plain bad and as a fan of the games I'm severely disappointed and disgusted with Scott's desire to ruin his own franchise with references to anything but the matpat m-preg story he wrote. If you think the story went down hill after pizzeria simulator you won't like this movie. Some people say this movie is for the fans but my friend and I were so beyond upset after leaving the theater because if this is what fans like I severely worry about their judgement in other parts of life if they can rave over a lack of story, 8 plots that go nowhere and a complete betrayal to everything the first games were.

There is not a single redeeming quality. The writing is poor, the acting is mediocre, and it is not scary at all. It seems like the only positive reviews are coming from prior fans of the game series who hold a bias, but for the average viewer who's just wanting to watch a good film this is a fail. The pacing in the movie is very jarring, and there is also far too much dialogue and not enough action. The plot is a convoluted mess and the final showdown was a huge let down. The run time of the film is rather long yet it still wasn't able to make any sense of the story. Completely forgettable and generic.

Just not enjoyable.No clear storyline, no likeable characters, predicatable as hell.It was so boring, it felt like it was on for about 3 hours, it just wouldn't end.The costumes/animatronics were good but very underused.I had just watched exorcist believer and thought that this year's halloween movies couldn't possibly get any worse but then I saw this and realised, yes things could sink even further, a lot further.Let's hope this put and end to this franchise before it gets going. I couldn't possibly sit through this or anything like it ever again.

first game. How wrong I was. I really wanted more footage of the security guard "surviving". He spent like three nights there...dreaming about his brother. I wanted Freddy to show up at the door with the theme song and him like freak out like everyone did when they would play a fnaf game. I understand the directors needing to place the base layer of info for people who haven't played the game, but it was incredibly slow. Also, there was maybe 1 halfway decent jumpscare! I think every fan wanted a handful of scares just like the games. One thing I did like was the animatronics. They seemed to behave properly like the game, but that was 1 pro and way too many cons. I hope when and if they try to make a sequel, they will change it drastically.

There is no horror at all in it. It actually reminds me of a bad part 2 of The Banana Splits comedy horror movie and that was bad. Freddy's is worse than that!. They could have made it so much better and should have. PG13 says it all really. They should have bumped it to 15 or 18 and actually showed the horror instead of cutting off any potential horror. I just do not see the point in having somebody get killed but not get killed but they are killed. What I mean is, person about to get killed then scene changes to something completely different and of course, they are dead but no death shown. Make it a 15 or 18 and have it like saw. Show it all. What a big let down. I would say watch Banana splits, it is bad but it is better than this rubbish.

blood thirsty horror as the original games were. I understand this was all based on Scott's decision and rightly so but it 110% would've been better as the games if the horror was there. Yeah we only got a few blood scenes and a few jump scares but I really wanted more man lol! I also wish that the animatronics were scary af like I thought it was weird that them, Vanessa, Mike and Abbie huddled on the floor together like im sorry wha????????? XDJosh hutcherson and Matthew Lilard were good as Mike and William Afton but I felt the storyline was just stiff and un scary. But hey if it's a thing there is a sequel going to be announced in the future , I will try to attempt on checking that out and hope that it would be better than this first one.

And it's because of the living tombstone's song.If that doesn't tell you about the quality of this movie, I don't know what will.My review has to have 500 more characters to post, so I'll just go ahead and break it down for you I guess. In the least spoiler-y way possible.Whoever made this movie has no idea how to make a horror movie. Who is your audience? Children? Adults? It's not at all clear who this was aimed for and that's probably the biggest reason it fell flat.Had it been a gory horror movie, maybe it would've been better. But since there are several scenes in the movie where it seems to be pandering to little kids, it feels like the whole movie is a big identity crisis.Also the writing just sucks.Allow me to clarify (I edited this in since I had some time to think about it later and talk to other people about it). A major character died. No funeral, no police investigation. The body wasn't hidden it was in a house, the MAIN CHARACTER'S house. Yet? No mention of it after? Just nothing, like it never happened.On top of that, a major plot point is about the main character's brother. We find out who did it, but it was NEVER elaborated on. WHAT happened to him. WHY did it happen. WHERE is his body. Just nothing at all. It's like the writers forgot that was the literal main plot of their story. (It would have made much more sense to make the brother like... one of the animatronics... no idea why they didn't just do that. EASY solution to all of those questions.)Then there's a scene where the cop is asking the main character about why he didn't lock a door. Instead of him saying "I did lock the door" or "I'm sorry I forgot to lock the door" he instead replies "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND". Wha? Huh? Then he walks the cop to a little creek, sits down, and goes on a giant boring exposition about his brother. HOW is this related to locking a door.You wasted 10+ minutes of screen time retelling something we were shown at least 5 times by then, but had no clear response to the question he had been asked. So when you look at the WHOLE situation, the conversation went like this:"why didn't you lock the door" "you don't understand, my brother is dead and here's how that happened". DID YOU LOCK THE DOOR OR DID YOU NOT? THIS ANSWERS NOTHING.On top of all of this, no police investigation into the missing victims that are shown on screen dying. No mention of them after. Everything just resumes as normal.WHY did Afton want the main character to work at the pizza place as a night guard after finding out he was the brother of the kid? WHY didn't the girl straight up tell the main character about her dad and instead "hinted at it". WHY did she have to hint. It's not like he was watching her. Nobody was. She could have just straight up said it.By the way, she was supposed to be on duty, yet she stayed there the whole night with the main character. What about the rest of her route? Makes NO sense. How did she explain it to her coworkers when she was MIA for so long.WHEN THE TAPE MESSES UP, WHY DID THE MAIN CHARACTER HIT THE TV? INSTEAD OF THE VHS PLAYER? Hitting the TV will do nothing to effect the tape messing up, come on guys.WHY didn't the animatronics whip around quickly, like they did in the games? Why were they so slow the entire movie? All of the jump scares fell so flat because everything was too well lit and the animatronics moved too slow. Whats the point of a flashlight when everything's so well lit nobody even bothers to turn on a light to see.Why are they scared of the Balloon Boy doll? You have to have CONTEXT for him to be scary. My mom, who barely knows about the FNAF series, watched the movie on her own and was completely baffled by why there were jump scares with the doll. It just. Looks like a doll. You have to know WHY it's scary for it to BE scary.It's just not a movie made for anyone. Too bloody to be for kids, too boring for teens, too kiddish for adults. There are so many things in this movie that DON'T MAKE SENSE.They don't even do a good job convincing you that he's poor, because there are government programs for people who need help with child care. Yet he is never shown reaching out about it and decides to just take his sister to work with him.He also acts like the animatronics being alive is. Normal. He isnt freaking out about it. No reaction just. Huh? Oh. This is normal.How did he know the kids were the ones from his dreams. Why did he just decide they were ghosts in his dream instead of just a dream. He looks at them and is just "OH! You're the missing kids!". What?So people that are mad about people rating this movie poorly, understand that you can enjoy things and they can be fun, but that doesn't mean they can't be critiqued by people who expected the movie, that was inspired by a game, to be more like the game.I wish I could give it a higher score for the puppets and for Matthew being in the movie, but there were no many negatives that it cancels out the positives.That's my honest review. I'm not a "hater" I'm not someone who never played the games. I'm a person who likes horror and likes good horror media, and this was not that.Thanks for reading.

out that I haven't played or owned any of the Five Nights at Freddy's games so I won't compare the movie to the games at all. With that out of the way, let's see what this movie was and was it worth the hype?Eh. I like horror movies and this sort of captured that horror feeling but not a lot. Matthew Lillard was somewhat okay but I was underwhelmed by his performance considering I was excited to see him in this movie. The CGI is good, I can't say it's perfect but it is practically a replica of the characters in the games from what I've seen. I know I've mentioned Lillard's performance so I won't glance over that again but what I will say is the acting in this movie is below average, mostly because the bad actors get more screen time, like the security guard (you may think he's good but I don't) and the child actors who try and I'll give them props for that but like most child actors are mediocre at best. I like the plot but the execution lets it down via the acting. I reckon if it wasn't as hyped as it was, Five Nights at Freddy's would be an okay movie, nothing special about it, but considering the popularity of FNAF and the hype this movie got, I was disappointed with the movie and I think I shouldn't play the games if they were a carbon copy of the movie. I would watch it if you like FNAF but if you don't, then I would pass.3/10.

                                                      Hmm, so this DIDN'T turn out to be the Halloween gift I was anticipating. I've played the first FNAF game on my PC back in 2014, and the only thing the film gets right are the animatronic designs. I can picture the director's passion in wanting to stay true to the game's lore, but as a horror film, Emma Tammi utterly fails to deliver the goods. The film sets up a backstory for its protagonist played by Josh Hutcherson, but the pizzeria and its fascinating inhabitants barely get anything substantial.The tone is all over the place, and the film just doesn't let anything circumstantially funny be treated as funny. I think the makers went down the wrong path when they decided NOT to make this into a horror-comedy, which it well and truly could've been. The animatronics don't startle at all, and even for someone who hasn't played any of the videogames, this will come across as tame and lacking in thrills.Hutcherson puts up an okay show, but I absolutely did not enjoy Elizabeth Lail's performance (or characterization). You could literally call her "Exposition Dump" and it'd make no difference. Matthew Lillard is sort of there too, but what's even the point? I'm guessing the PG-13 rating is in line with what the original games wanted to offer: less gore, more atmospheric. Here, they achieve neither. And that's certainly a knock on the game's creator Scott Cawthon, who's part of the writing team here. There are too many scenes where violence is implied, but never shown. Ugh, bummer!

this brief and spoiler free as possible but too say this is bad is a understatement, it's a absolute disappointment to any merits of filmmakingThe "Five Nights at Freddy's" movie, based on the popular video game franchise, fails to deliver the scares and excitement one would expect from such a beloved source material.From the get-go, the movie's pacing is completely off, with a slow and tedious build-up that lacks any real tension or intrigue. The audience is left waiting for something interesting to happen, but unfortunately, that moment never comes.The characters are underdeveloped and uninteresting, making it difficult to feel any sense of connection or sympathy for their plight. The performances are wooden and lack any real depth, further adding to the movie's overall lack of appeal.The special effects and animatronics, which should have been the movie's saving grace, are surprisingly subpar. The animatronics lack the creepiness and realism that made the video game so frightening, instead coming off as cheap and unconvincing.Moreover, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the video game franchise so popular in the first place. The suspenseful gameplay, the eerie atmosphere, and the intricate backstory are all lost in translation, leaving fans of the franchise disappointed and frustrated.In conclusion, the "Five Nights at Freddy's" movie is a massive letdown. With its lackluster performances, poor special effects, and failure to capture the essence of the source material, this film is not worth your time or money.

of the movie came out claiming it would be a 3 hour long R rated movie I was ecstatic, only to later find out it was an hour 50 and pg13. Still I went into it with hope, and when I saw news of the first to watch it hating it I excused it, many people aren't fans of the games so maybe they just didn't know enough about them to thoroughly enjoy it as I hopped I would. Went in exsited, found myself wishing the movie would just end not even half way through, a major disappointment, the film had no atmosphere, the gore was non existent, the horror franchise I grew up on was adapted into a movie I would more describe a comedy, no scares what so ever, I predicted every single twist and reveal, I even predicted the lines the characters would say before they even said it. I grew up imagining getting springlocked as a horrific brutal and gory endeavour only to find it so tame and bland i nearly walked out of the theatre, the actors did a fine job but nothing outstanding, I wish Matthew lilard went full stu maucher with the "I always come back" line. I found the story to be the most boring strung together peice of work, to the point I was thinking of ways I would have changed the movie to make it better and found not one element of this "movie" to make the cut, so disappointed im genuinely sad as I hoped this would be a fantastic film full of fun jumpscares and gore, only to stumble upon the worst film of the year, possibly even the worst film I've seen that's come out since I was born, not to be dramatic, I was just so let down. I do really hope the fnaf franchise gets another movie that hopefully does it right, as the kids raised on the movie have grown up, they want to see a horror film for them now, not as a gateway horror for the younger kids who may have not even been born when the games came out. We want wall to wall jump scares, brutal gore, scary ambiance, and swearing, no one says "what the heck", at least no one respectable. As a huge fan of the franchise I really hope for another movie that may do it better, to mr. Blum ik it may be way more exspensive to do it the way fans want it, but it will pay off in the long run.

He is the sole provider for his young sister Abby (Piper Rubio). Their creepy Aunt Jane (Mary Stuart Masterson) is trying to take custody of Abby. Mike struggles to keep any job for long. He starts as overnight security guard at a closed Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Police officer Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail) drops by to check on him.I have never played the game but I do know of it. I don't think that it matters. This is not scary. They are trying to tell a story with the non-scary horror. At the end of the day, it's been ten years since the video game first appeared. Since then, there has been other similar products in various media and have stolen Freddy's thunder. I do like Hutcherson and his troubled character. The movie is somewhat slow at the beginning. This is a mixed bag and I'll give it a pass.

I haven't played the game so i don't know how good the story has been adapted.For me, the movie was dull and lazy. The story and the script felt half baked and it felt that the story had more potential to have more thriller and horror elements. The screenplay was also uneven, the direction was average and the performances were above average. The suspense and the thrill were missing from the movie and it feels like a bland story from which you were expecting too much.Overall, I won't say that the movie was bad but it was neither good. It had it's moments and Irate it as an average.

                                            The movie was fantastic, okay maybe it was missing that horror element, but it just brought me back to my childhood. The cast is pretty good you have, Boy from the hunger games, mr.crazy killer from scream, and the love interest from the first season of you. The story was simple yet it wasn't boring, it never lost my attention. The animatronics were awesome. The movie felt as if you were playing the game but obviously you weren't. Obviously the movie isn't canon but it takes the elements from the game and uses them in a way where it almost explains the whole lore, well if it was simplified. A person that has never played the game can have a very simple and easy understanding of what is happening.

It's nearly as bad as it sounded, but I try to not pay to see garbage, though I certainly have unwittingly done so, but this was available on Peacock. This made a small fortune in theaters even while streaming, so I thought a look might be deserved. Wrong! It isn't scary at any moment, though I wouldn't advise it for small children. It has quite a few jump shots that just don't work and it is silly, not funny, beyond words. It's not cheap looking and it has a decent lead in Josh Hutcherson, a good actor who hasn't been able to really find much success since The Hunger Games. He's very game here taking this very seriously, though he looked weary near the end. Horrible is not strong enough word for the lead female character. The writing for this role made me cringe and the performance by Elizabeth Lail didn't help. The little girl was okay. The ending is a complete bore and it's set up for a sequel. Hutcherson has gotten his big hit, but I cannot help but wonder if he expected or wanted it to be this?!

I want to preface this review by saying that I am someone who came into this solely to watch the movie. I never played the game and know very little about the characters/storyline.I came into it with a very basic understanding - a man owning a pizzeria uses it as a guise to kidnap and murder children, and then somehow trapping their souls in the animatronics.Knowing what I knew, I was intrigued when I heard a movie about it would be coming out. I was interested in seeing how they would make that come to life.That being said, right off the bat, I was disappointed with how little gore/scares there were. The majority of "violence" happened off screen. This movie is classified as horror. Not a single moment made me jump or feel scared.The movie was both short but also felt like long stretches of nothing was happening.**SPOILERS** Now this might come from my lack of knowing about the lore, but my biggest gripe was Vanessa. So a cop knows her dad is going around murdering people? And she tried "warning" Mike by doing next to nothing. Again, maybe this might be better explained from fans of the story, but her whole character was just riddled with problems.I kinda wish this movie went into a little more depth. Everything felt very surface level. Nothing is really explained too well. I wish there more background/screen time on William.Overall, it was a somewhat enjoyable watch. It's definitely a movie you can't take too seriously. By the looks of the ending, it looks like they'll be another. Hopefully the next one will step up it's game.

As a fan of FNAF since September of 2014, this is the best way they could've done the movie.Saying the FNAF lore is complicated would be an understatement. The FNAF lore is all over the place with many puzzles still left unanswered. This movie brings the main and most important parts of the lore and puts it in the movie, which can be complicated for people who never played the games.The animatronics and other visuals are FANTASTIC! Jim Henson's Creature Shop did such an incredible job at the animatronics. I was blown away when I first saw the trailers of how accurate they were to the games! And for those who complain Bonnie is blue in the movie, he always was. The red eyes were controversial but this movie isn't in the same universe as the games and the red eyes look alright.The scariness in the movie was what I was the most underwhelmed by. In the UK the movie is a 15 which was kind of a surprise to me, the goriness to me was more like A Quiet Place level of gore (A Quiet Place is a 12). I do not believe gore is required to scare people, for me goriness just grosses you out, not scare you. Scariness for me is tension and jumpscares. Jumpscares aren't really a thing in this movie besides one or two scenes. I wish there will be more of a horror factor in the sequel (which I believe is currently in pre production).Overall, this movie is over hated. It is made for the FANS, not the CRITICS. Go ahead and watch the movie!

It focuses on a dark story and a brother / sister relationship over the horror for sure but it is done extremely well to the point that we love both Abby and Mike by the halfway point which adds a ton of tension to the final act.I've seen many people saying the story is 'confusing' which unless you are half a brain cell short of being considered a mental invalid I have no idea how. I have not played any of the games and know nothing more than the basic premise and I still followed this film easily and had a great grasp on what was going on. The story was mysterious but that worked in it's favor more than anything.My only complaint is that the third act felt a little rushed and I definitely think we should've seen the villain a lot more.Awesome movie and one of the best of the year. 10/10 for me.

                        As always, we have your typical dynamics that we see frequently in movies. When it is a male main character and a female one that has the answers.. she will refuse to give the guy the answeres that would make the guy's life much easier.. had blondie there just old him what was happening, Mike could have done something about it..\nbut of course, had the main character been a female and police officer a male, she would have gotten on his face and made him tell her the truth.The scene when mike wakes up and the police officer lady bandaged his arm.. so, the big toy cornered him at the locked door but he got away somehow? Ok, he asks her about the babysitter and the brother and she already knew they were gone.. she never told him anything about them being possessed.. dude, what kind of cop is this chick anyway.. it was the second time he asked her.. and she just babbled something and never answered...her explaining about the kids... we all know that if it were the other way around as in the male officer having kept everything from the woman and his father being the killer.. we know she would have sucker punched real good.. right?The dude from the job office being the bad guy.. it was obvious from the start since he was the only other character introduced besides the already dead ones..so in the end.. the animatronics were possessed or the kids were actually inside physically? I didnt understand and didnt make any sense.. all of this drama o mike not remembering.. only for it to be ignored.. his brother is gone and the soul.. who knows.. i thought there would be a twist .. maybe his brother was in one of the things.. but nah.. so this arc was just nonsense to make him look like he spent the night drinking.

                           I can see why some people are disappointed at the movie, because this is VERY loosely based on the video game lore. Don't expect crucial parts of the lore to be any important in this movie, nor anything scary, this is more like if a casual non-fan were to make a FNAF based movie. However, the movie on itself isn't that interesting or cohesive. At some points it felt like a drama, then comedy, suspense, then an action horror but at an uneven pace. The new lore/story was an interesting take but it couldn't compensate for how messy and rushed the movie felt. I question why a studio like blumhouse kept the movie in production for a bunch of years, and being made "top" priority just for it to come up short stacked and lack lustered. There was big potential on how to handle this franchise as a movie series but I guess long time fans have to settle for less (corprate hollywood production). But hey, it's for the kids.

play with us\nFor many years we've been all alone\nWe're forced to be still and play\nThe same songs we've known since that day\nAn imposter took our life away\nNow we're stuck here to decay\nPlease let us get in\nDon't lock us away\nWe're not like what you're thinking\nWe're poor little souls\nWho have lost all control\nAnd we're forced here to take that role\nWe've been all alone\nStuck in our little zone\nSince 1987\nJoin us, be our friend\nOr just be stuck and defend\nAfter all you only got\nFive nights at Freddy's\nIs this where you want to be?I just don't get it\nWhy do you want to stay?Five nights at Freddy's\nIs this where you want to be?I just don't get it\nWhy do you want to stay?Five nights at Freddy's, oh\nWe're really quite surprised\nWe get to see you another night\nYou should have looked for another job\nYou should have said to this place good-bye\nIt's like there's so much more\nMaybe you've been in this place before\nWe remember a face like yours\nYou seem acquainted with those doors\nPlease let us get in\nDon't lock us away\nWe're not like what you're thinking\nWe're poor little souls\nWho have lost all control\nAnd we're forced here to take that role\nWe've been all alone\nStuck in our little zone\nSince 1987\nJoin us, be our friend\nOr just be stuck and defend\nAfter all you only got\nFive nights at Freddy's\nIs this where you want to be?I just don't get it\nWhy do you want to stay\nFive nights at Freddy's?Is this where you want to be?I just don't get it\nWhy do you want to stay\nFive nights at Freddy's? Oh.

an adaptation that's light on scares and too heavy on lore. It's pretty funny and really weird but it's also almost entirely free of any terror or tension, constantly undermining itself and over-explaining everything to the point nothing makes sense.Possibly even more of a crime than any of that though, is the fact that it's just really boring, diverting almost all of its screen time to the wrong aspects. It's a serious contender for the least scary horror film of all time. Being gore free doesn't help either, it's hard to be scared of the animatronics when you can't actually see what they're doing to people.Josh Hutcherson ironically spends most of the film sleeping, his bored attitude does occasionally work in its favour until anything major happens, then he just feels too restrained. Matthew Lillard clearly understands the assignment and the only issue is he's not in the film anywhere near enough.Emma Tammi's direction has a fair few frustrating missed opportunities, even if the practical effects are cool. Early sequences use CCTV to establish themselves until they actually get to the Freddy's when that's suddenly dropped. A lack of jump scares is usually a good thing but considering the source material it's weird there's so few present.The score by the Newton Brothers is surprisingly good. It switches back and forth between being an effective 80s homage and just really eerie in a way that's actually more unsettling than the animatronics themselves, who make way too much noise any time they move and don't look creepy enough.

global pandemic and it was under Warner bros...safe hands.They wash there hands of it and so many script changes and issues has cursed this beloved video game. The fact it finished filming in February 2023 and was released 8 months later says it all.The Animatronics do look good I will admit that, but who's stupid idea was it to go against the game and have they move on screen? The whole scare point of the game is they move but you never see them move you just see them in different camera shots.The evil aunt was a stupid addition five nights has a good backstory so why change it.Apart from the Animatronics I'm really struggling to think of a positive for this film.At 1hr 49mins long it's a painful watch, I just hope the sequal does it better.

appear.Maybe budget? Maybe trying to build a deeper story but I got so tired of the kidnapped brother storyline, I get how it's important but did not need to take up that much time with it. It felt like a cop-out for production not having enough money to have the characters in more scenes. The constant flashbacks to the same scene ruined it for me.That said, the animatronics were incredible, just scarce throughout the movie, and not in a "keeping the scary stuff unseen" way. I like the characters, but especially the cop's story fell apart at the end. She can't be good and not tell them what's going on.Overall, a lazy story focused on keeping the animatronics offscreen unless completely necessary, the saving grace is the animatronics when they appear.

a sleeper-hit indie-game that took the internet by storm when it came out. Now fast forward to 2023 and the long-gestating film finally got released: and it's as 'crowd pleasing' as a film based off its source material can be; too bad the jump scares here are been-there-done-that-cliches that only leave microseconds of impression on the brain of discernible horror film aficionados out there, only to be forgotten completely by the time the credits roll.The film's puppetry is easily the star of the show here; Jim Henson's Creature Shop did commendable work with the animatronics here, and it justifies the film's existence on that front. If only the script didn't have such a... barren scope and sense of depth to it. Five Nights at Freddy's wasn't gonna be a blockbuster kind of film exactly, but the story had every right to be deserving of a deeper screenplay: instead the film uses a barebones jump scare fest that is built on sequel-bait instead of telling a complete and worthwhile story.2023 seems to have given rise to the video game film in a way that's more consistent than the one-off-megahits like the Resident Evil films; The Super Mario Brothers Movie has opened the floodgates for the battered video game film, and the quality of said films are gonna be all over the place.Five Nights at Freddy's has great puppetry but the story can't match that aspect simply because there isn't enough to it. Maybe the next one will have a better script, but usually sequels have something to draw upon. I don't know what the draw is here.2/5 stars.

This atrociously bad family-horror movie just abandons those factors and introduces us to a bunch of characters and situations we don't care about. Josh Hutcherson plays a security guard haunted by a troubled past who begins working the night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a local family diner. However, he soon comes to realise that the restaurant holds dark secrets of its own.When you look at the production design and the look of the animatronic animals, you're witnessing such incredible potential that the film should've dedicated more of its focus to. Freddy Fazbear's is a dilapidated building with so much detail cast upon every wall, floor and stage in every area. Freddy, Foxie, Bonnie and Chica are these giant machines that are super menacing when they're standing still, but unfortunately, they always seem less threatening when we see them moving around in their robotic states.Running just a minute short of 110 minutes, it would've been reasonable to have 20-30 minutes of character development towards the start before thrusting our lead character into the position of the security guard, and dedicating the rest of the film to that. Unfortunately however, this movie just goes ballistic with the amount of character development and sub-themes. It ends up being a "drama" about a man's traumatic outlook on life, the abduction of a young child that took place decades ago, and a custody battle that's been tossed into the mix at the last minute; that's not what you should be saying about a new movie titled after and based off of the popular survival game series Five Nights at Freddy's.Excluding the atrocious amount of time used to set up the main character and the story that lap over the movie we came to see, Five Nights at Freddy's is also extremely boring, and it has a major lack of terror and tension. The horror of most horror movies often consist of way too many jump-scares, but of course in the adaptation of a game that has a major focus on jump-scares delivered by the animatronics, there's only a few jump-scares in this movie, which will leave so many hard-core fans in immense disappointment. It's also worth noting that games weren't focused on extreme violence or gore; it was always the high levels of terror that made them so effective. But without any real suspense, it would've made sense to just throw in a fun gore-fest.Perhaps one of the film's most annoying inclusions however, was something you knew would take place due to the trailers and marketing, is the fact that Josh Hutcherson's character is also responsible for taking care of his child-aged sister. This is something that should've been limited to the story taking place outside of Freddy Fazbear's, and you'd expect the kid to only have real value in that other plot. Unfortunately, the screenwriters have decided that this wide-eyed, fearless and creepy little girl who listens to no grown ups would be the source of bait for the animatronic animals. In many scenes, Josh Hutcherson and Elizabeth Lail will be having a conversation that's suddenly interrupted by this girl screaming like she's being attacked, to which they run out to save her, and it turns out that the animatronics are just being a little ticklish and goofy. These animatronics look awesome, the film is directed nicely, and there's plenty of references and details that fans will enjoy picking up on. But looking past all of that, all that's left is horror clichés, missed opportunities and the fact that they made another piece of garbage out of a game we love.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.

fun, when it comes to video games you've grown to love as a true fan of many genres you like to reconsider playing, and then make a pretty good fun film based on video games, but only if you have to tell a really good story.Don't get me wrong, there are some video game movies that are good and some are bad with terrible story or writings, but sometimes you just gotta live with it, most of the time.Josh Hutcherson did a really good job with his performance, and Matthew Lillard tho, he's the right guy, and the right man for the job to steal the whole show with his powerful acting skills.First he was Stu Marcer from Scream and then Shaggy from Scooby-Doo movies, but now for FNAF, I think you'll definitely enjoy this movie when you come to realize that it's a pretty good video game movie when you get around with many video game genres.But either, I had a lot of fun, and I say this movie deserves a sequel, no matter how long it takes, but Five Nights at Freddy's movie needs another sequel, because Blumhouse and Scott Cawthon did a pretty good job with there creative skills of horror and scares, and all the fun you'll have at the movies!8/10.

Please tell me that they are gonna make an adult version of this, because this babyified version is an insult to all fnaf game lovers. Who ever made this ruined it for everyone who was anticipating it so much including me. The story is completely wrong and some of the animatronics are nice? If you cant make a movie right dont do it at all, if you cant handle violence dont make a movie that should be gruesome. The movies producer clearly wasnt a real fan and should either do some research and try again or give it to someone who can do it right the first time.........

After several movies that have taken animatronic animals to the creepy extreme, I was excited by Five Nights at Freddy's screening as a movie. I don't play video games, but based upon The Banana Splits and Willy's Wonderland movies, I had high hopes for this film seeing as these other films had ideas similar to this or based upon some idea of this video game.And Freddy's is just sort of there. Acting is good. Story is good. Production is decent. Nice ideas and decent expansion for character development.But overall, Freddy's just meanders through the story without much in terms of tension or suspense. They tie the story lines together nicely, although these were obvious. And it just resolves itself. Elements are taken out of the action, and viola, no more issue. Nothing seems to have much weight, and the solutions are pretty simple.I "liked" it overall but with much criticism. Not bad but not something that I want to watch again or need a sequel. Josh Hutcherson does an excellent acting job though pulling away from his typical type of role.(Ultimately, I'd like a sequel to Willy's Wonderland and more of that gonzo Nicolas Cage character.)

similar tone with this animatronic horror film. It's kind of crazy how rapidly this film will shift from depressing child murder drama to a happy-go-lucky fever dream. It doesn't strike that in-on-the-joke tone that M3GAN excelled at. While I think there should be some darker horror elements, far too infrequently does the film revel in the goofy camp of its premise. The dead kid stuff is just not very original and not very well executed. Add in being incredibly predictable with paper thin characters too.This film also drags on far too long. You could easily cut 25 minutes and nothing would change. The story beats get hammered over and over with some honestly poor resolution. Five Nights at Freddy's is a big miss from a reasonably reliable studio.

For a fan of the games like me, this was exactly what I have been waiting for. Jim Hensons Creature Shop and Blumhouse under the watchful eye of the amazing Scott Cawthon made a visually stunning and compelling movie that now made cannon so many speculations that fans have been dying for! The theatre was electrified the entire time and it was like playing the games or watching your favorite YouTuber play it but on a big screen. Truly Fantastic! Freddy proves that the best stuff will "Always Come Back!" Thank you to the developers for making this! Absolutely incredible!

Very controversial review. But I loved it. I mean, loved it. First off the story/plot of the game on the big screen was amazing. Some of the kills were great (even though censored heavily but I mean hey, kids in the audience). As a FNAF veteran (Since the month the game CAME OUT); I enjoyed every minute of this, even though it may seem like "typica horror schlock" to the general audience. My only gripe was that COME ON BLUMHOUSE, you underused MATTHEW LILLARD??? That and some flaws in writing were the only issues I have but honestly, as a "bad movie lover", I bypassed them. Just so happy to see the animatronics going beyond the games, and also how perfect they look. The bro-sis chemistry between Josh and Piper was also great. Gonna enjoy this again VERY soon. Definitely BlumHouse's safest play for wanting kids to go see it. Concerning the general audience, I can understand not liking it for its flaws, but fans are definitely gonna love it. I loved it.

                                    To follow the core story of "Five Nights at Freddy's", you do not need to have played the game. I have never picked up a copy of "FNAF" and went into the movie somewhat blind, only knowing bits and pieces of the lore. As events unfolded, there was never a moment when the main plot felt confusing. As a mildly creepy, jump-scare filled thriller, the film delivered.The main character, Mike, has a strong backstory with clear motives and reasoning. His character has a strong focus on a concept called "Dream Theory", which is fascinating. The performance by Josh Hutcherson is admirable and I truly cared about what happened to him and his sister.Apart from big blockbuster superhero films, I have never seen a crowd so excited and invested in a movie. On more than one occasion, the majority of the crowd went berserk with enthusiastic applause, and I had no clue the reason. While the story was simple to follow, the deeper pieces of "FNAF" lore left a portion of the audience on the outside of an inside joke.Rather than keep the film a tight 90 minutes, there is about 20 minutes of fluff that unnecessarily dragged on. The side-plot of the movie was dull and half-baked, with some of the characters falling into stereotypes. Similarly, though Mike's backstory is interesting, the end of his narrative lacks closure.As the end credits rolled, I leaned over to talk to some of the patrons who cheered the loudest during the "inside joke" moments. The two audience members had this to say: "It was a cinematic masterpiece. We know everything about "FNAF", having played all the games, and it stayed true to about 75% of the source material."If you are familiar with "Five Nights at Freddy's", this film will not disappoint. However, as someone with minimal exposure to the source material, the result was a bit lackluster.Best Character - Mike\nBest Scene - The Dreams\nBest Piece of Score - "Five Nights at Freddy's"

It is watchable. But as a fan, I am honestly disappointed. I grew up on the games and my childhood is based on fnaf. Honestly, I know the film is based on the books, and yes I didn't read them. I know that Scott said the books are canon as well as the games, but the fanbase grew up on THE GAMES NOT THE BOOKS. I just don't get why they didn't made the film based on the lore of the games, I am sure if they had done it, every fan would have enjoyed the film.Basically this film is about Mike whose little brother was kidnapped and he couldn't get over it. He lives with his young sister who can speak with ghosts. He gets the security job and meets Vanessa. Vanessa is strange but kind. A babysitter was looking after Abby, while Mike is at work. Mike had a fight before and his aunt wants to take Abby from her because she finds him irresponsible. So the anomatronics want Abby to become like them, and Mike wants to know who killed his brother. The ghost children told Mike they will give him his brother but he has to do anything they want. Mike said yes but after he regretted it and the anomatronics got mad. Soon William appeared in spring bonnie custome, and Abby showed the anomatronics that he is their killer. Also before it, Vanessa tells Mike that his father, William Afton is the killer. William stabs her. So after Abby shows the anomatronics the truth, they got mad and the springlock failure happens. At the end, Vanessa is in the hospital.All in all, this movie was disappointing for a fan, I would recommend this, just because the actors were great and the anomatronics were cool. But the plot wasn't as great as I wished)):



A good cast and the animatronics were done very well. Mike is clearly down in the dumps. Cannot keep a job, has his sister Abby whom he loves, but his aunt is seeking custody so he desperately needs a good job. He is haunted by seeing his brother Garrett kidnapped from a park outing when he was 12 and relives the scenes through dreams every night. He is offered a job. The pay is not great, and the hours are worse. It is a night security guard at a closed pizza play place. It was abandoned after some children seemingly disappeared from there. Mike plays the role of a down and out person very well. But having to chose between losing Abby and taking the job, he takes the job. All he has to do is stay awake at night and make sure no one breaks in. But things do go bump in the night. One night, Vanessa, a police officer, stops by as the place is on her beat. She tells him some of the history of the place, and shows the animatronics. A couple of days later, Abby's babysitter works with three others to break in and wreck the place, so Mike will lose his job, and the aunt will get Abby. That didn't turn out well. From here on, it starts to get excessively complex and in some ways confusing. This detracts from the movie that didn't need to happen.

                                           "Five Nights at Freddy's" is a movie adaptation that disappoints in comparison to the gripping video game series it's based on. While the animatronics and the core premise remain intriguing, the film's lack of character development, disjointed storytelling, and inconsistent horror elements hinder its potential. Fans of the games might appreciate seeing the characters on the big screen, but the film fails to fully capture the essence of what made the franchise so captivating. It's a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the lore and fear-inducing elements of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. While it's not without its merits, "Five Nights at Freddy's" falls short of its potential and earns a modest 5/10 🌟

I don't usually do this since I respect the effort required by so many individuals to create a feature film. But for this movie, I felt cheated on - I spent 13 euros on sitting through the most boring and soulless piece of media in existence.I went into the movie with a friend of mine and we both expected a fun time. We both weren't new to the franchise and had fun playing the games as kids so I assumed that it we were part of the target audience. And I was so wrong.The plot is centered around a guy whose brother was kidnapped when he was younger. This tragic event led to him trying to find the kidnapper by attempting to recreate the scenery in his sleep. This attempt, however, leads to him spacing out often, being emotionally unstable and, thus, not being able to keep a job.At the same time, there is the conflict about him being responsible for his sister since his parents passed away. His aunt tries to gain custody of his sister as a result of his financial and emotional instability. Since the guy does not want his sister to be taken away from him, he accepts a job at Freddy Fazbears Pizzeria.While this plot is not that horrible, it is executed so poorly that I could not take any of it seriously after approximately 30 minutes. None of the characters' motivations are plausible: why would the main character who is in his mid twenties, struggles with his finances, has deep psychological problems and shows no sign of willingness to interact with his sister sacrifice everything to retain custody? Why would his aunt who also has no identifiable grudge against the main character and has no connection to her niece try to destroy his life in such an undiplomatic manner (for instance, she initiates a robbery of the pizzeria to make him loose his job, which is entirely unnecessary in the context of his already existing issues). There are NO likable characters in this movie which is completely insane. The ones that are (or at least seem to be) written to be likable are insufferable in most of the dialogues. The movie probably would have been better if the lines were cut by 50%.While the movie failed to deliver a good plot, it was still true to the lore of the games. The integration of the lore, however, felt akward and forced. Some characters even outright stated some lore knowledge which totally misses the point of why the underlying plot of the games worked so well: the beauty of the storytelling in the games laid in its subtility. If you didn't want to know anything about the story, you were not bombarded with lore.The fixation on the lore was made obvious through the appearance of matpat, a known overanalizer of small details regarding the Fnaf games. While the appearance was cute and I smiled when he showed up, it was ultimately pointless and it felt like this cameo (and the implementation of that's just a theory) did not fit into a universe that wants to take itself so serious.The acting severely suffered under the poor writing, that is all I can say about that. It is pretty hard to appreciate the acting of someone that plays the most poorly written and unlikable character that was exposed to the world in a long time.Then there is the horror aspect of the movie. Well, actually there isn't. I understand that it was meant to be appealing to a larger audience but scares were basically non-existent. All the animatronics that seemed so frightening in the games were more of a laughingstock and the atmosphere of the haunted diner was destroyed almost as soon as the main cast of the animatronics appeared.I didn't expect it to be a bloody gorefest (most of the horror in the games was already really stomachable in my opinion) but I still was severely disappointed by the lack of anything remotely scary.While I almost exclusively found the movie astoundingly horrible, most of the times, the lighting, shots, music and general setting were always good and beautiful at times. This does slightly bump the rating but to be honest, the technicalities were not enough to cover up the horrific writing - If you dress a turd up nicely, it will still smell bad.Ultimately, the movie seemed like it didn't know what to be. It certainly wasn't a horror movie, took itself to seriously to be a comedy and was to whacky and poorly written to be a drama.So who is the movie even made for? Apparently not for me, that is all I can say.If you can stomach bad writing, unlikable characters, plotholes and eat up everything that a franchise feeds you, you will be having a pretty good time. Especially because there is a lot to discover regarding Easter eggs. If you are not familiar with the franchise or have standards when it comes to the quality of the media you consume, don't even bother. It was so bad that you cannot even laugh at it.

THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HOLLYWOOD AND MOVIES IN GENERAL ARE MISSING! This movie isnt scary but it has so much charm and does so much for the plot and characters. The plot was fun to uncover easier for the fans but still fun for people like my dad who dont pay attention to the games. WE NEED A SEQUEAL GOD BEST MOVIE OF THE 2000s!

Mike is deeply flawed, likely depressed, stressed, and with past trauma, which would explain why he has such a hard time keeping a job. Because of this, he cannot see the solution right in front of him, which is to sell the house.The notice of delinquency, which obviously doesn't refer to child support since Abby (his sister) is with him, is likely from the IRS or Mortgage company.Selling the house and moving would allow him to pay off his debts, give him a fresh start, and move somewhere else with more work to suit his talents. It would also allow him to get away from the toxic and narcissistic Aunt Jane. However, because of the aforementioned reasons, the obvious solution eludes him (plus the movie needs to happen, so...)The rest of it kind of falls apart, though...VCR static/damage/bad tracking seemed to have been created by someone who has never personally experienced those things. When a VCR tape is damaged or loses tracking, the whole image moves. The filter they applied (I'm guessing it was either Motion Array or Maxon Universe plugins for AE) was just applied on top, with a bit of image bleed. The entire image needed to jerk around, too. The tape was also too high resolution, and was clearly a progressive image when it should have been interlaced.The officer, Vanessa, says Mike's eyes are bloodshot, but they're clearly not.The people who broke in, what they did made absolutely no sense. They broke in after Mike had finished his shift, and after they saw him leave at the same time as the cop. So even if they claimed the break-in happened during Mike's shift, she could back him up that everything was fine up until he finished his shift.Other complaints I would just chalk up to weak writing taking the easy way to get to new scenes, or pushing the film in a certain direction...Why was Vanessa giving him a hard time about the pills? Why is he acting so shady about them? They're clearly prescription. It isn't a crime.She shouldn't even be implying he "left a door unlocked", or that he was "wacked out". She had no idea if he was even using it at work. For all she knew, it could have fallen out of his pocket or bag.Vanessa, in her own words, claims she can't wrap her head around why Mike would bring Abby (little sister) with him to work. She should already know why. Even though it's revealed a little later he has a secondary reason (the abduction mystery), what isn't a mystery is that he's Abby's legal guardian and he's struggling. A police officer in particular should understand parents (in this case, legal guardian), would need to bring their kid to work with them.Vanessa tells Mike to go home in the middle of his shift and seems to blame him for Abby getting electricuted, even though she herself witnessed sparks flying from the animatronic in question. She also knew exactly how dangerous they were from the beginning. She herself is equally to blame if blame needs to be laid.Vanessa is angry Mike brought Abby to Freddy's even though she herself encouraged Abby to stay there by helping build the fort. She's a hypocrite.The Pharmacist steps out of line by questioning a medication prescribed by a doctor to Mike. He looks at the prescription, and with a disapproving face says "you know what works for me?"... He even calls Mike a dirty name when Mike is having none of it and leaves, when it was really the Pharmacist's own fault. That was probably just a bit more awkward than anything else, since bad pharmacists surely exist.This could have been a great movie but the script needed some more time in the oven.

                                  And a 7-year-old child can watch something like that! The most horrifying part of the movie is when the main character gets scared by a balloon boy figure. Everything else was very peaceful. Very disappointed because what is promised a a horror movie ends up being something like the movie: Let's play with the animatronics and make a tent together. There were some parts of the movie that should be cut because they are very boring and existential problems. It should be mentioned that I seem to be missing something at the end, as if they worked better at the end than on the existential problems of the characters. It seemed to me that there was a strong emotional bond between Mike and Vanessa and I would have liked to see them at least kiss. In the end, instead, Vanessa ends up in the hospital bed and is in a coma and Mike comes to visit her. I feel it seems like the ending is a bit left up in the air......

            The fact that a FNAF movie even happened is just amazing on its own. I am sure lots of people just wanted something to come out just to have the FNAF name out there (they waited 8 years). It is very cool that it happened but due to a very inexperienced director and Scott Cawthon and others not having much experience in working on movies, it couldn't reach it's full potential.The FNAF franchise has so much great lore and material but a lot of it wasn't used. I'll start with the positives: the animatronics/puppets look fantastic, Jim Henson's team did an amazing job on them. They look about as true to the games as you can get. The cameos of certain people influential to this franchise were very nice to see and some parts were pretty funny. Josh Hutcherson did well as Mike and the guy playing Yellow Bunny (can't remember his name at the moment, he played Shaggy in the Scooby-Doo movies) was also good. The cons of this movie are really all based on the dialogue, writing, editing and directing. Some of the scenes are extremely awkward and even the best actors can't do much with such bad dialogue like there was in this movie. There are some shots that cut away too quickly. Lots of plot holes and sudden shifts in mood and setting that don't make much sense. We don't really get to take our time with the characters and understand them. I know this is supposed to be a simple movie and not a deep one but we should have some sense of their personalities than what was provided. The animatronics weren't as scary as they could have been and they are very scary in the games. The movie just can't decide if it's actually a horror movie or not at times. Overall, this movie had a lot of potential but it just couldn't reach it fully.

                                                        As the title says, this movie is the perfect example of a movie made for fans, that doesnt make it bad, but it kinda is. The story is made as a resume of a very big part of the games original story, but it delivers it so fast and without a real meaning that it doesnt work at all. This along with the fact that they also add a lot of new stuff, like the drawings that control the animatronics, the visions of the older brother, the aunt and her story, those things take away focus that is needed in the main story, explaing the mistery that this whole pizzeria has, they just present you with elements from the games but dont dive into them, they essentially just work as references. With tthat said, as a fan of the games, I did enjoy and understood much better everything the movie was trying to day, but to someone who doesnt know a thing about the saga, its gonna be a bad and boring movie.

other horror movie I've ever watched. Would definitely watch again! Only issue with this movie is the weird pacing. But the storytelling is absolutely amazing in this film. My favorite looking animatronic has to be Foxy, he just looks so amazingly done. Bonnie is a close second. Seriously though if you want a good horror movie to watch with your friends, this is the one for fans and non fans alike. I loved this movie, even if the critic reviews are negative, Scott made this movie with care. And he is what truly carried this movie in its entirety!

And this movie is pretty bad - even for B horror movie. Effects are fine - but these days even the lowest budget movies have fine effects.So what is left? Well the background story is kinda ok and the acting is also kinda believable.Where I think it goes wrong is when it tries to explain things with science and everyone just accepts obviously wrong assumptions about electricity and mechanics. Why not just embrace the supernatural and let that be the explanation for most things.The big brother is just stupid - I am tired of self-destructive no-good characters. It is just very hard to be sympathetic and be on his side when he keeps making so poor choices. And trauma or mental sickness does explain the choices.This is not scary at all, just kinda weird and frustrating to watch.

                                                     Didn't Josh Hutcherson used to be famous? Well here he is reduced to the role of the struggling brother of "Abby" (Piper Rubio). Their aunt (Mary Stuart Masterson) is determined that this hapless bag of bones isn't fit to look after the young girl - after he takes out a visiting father in the fountain of a shopping mall and gets fired; so "Mike" has to get another job! Opportunities are thin on the ground, but there is a vacancy doing the security night shift and an old, derelict, pizza parlour. How hard can it be? Well a meeting with the enigmatic police officer "Vanessa" (Elizabeth Lail) should have rung alarm bells, and when he has to take "Abby" there for one overnight shift - well it's soon clear that this place has secrets to keep and that it knows how to manipulate the hopes and fears of "Mike" and his sister. Can they stay sane and focussed long enough to survive this maze of malevolent mechanical bunnies? I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.

   When I saw this, I was excited. I mean, who didn't like Chucky or Annabelle right?! Another story about killer toys! Well, let me start by saying it wasnt like that. The story line was allover the place, the toys were such a disappointment and the plot has just riddled with holes. The characters were boring and had no real substance to who they are, but I think that came from the story.The opening scene had promise, but when the story unfolded, they seemed to dwell on unneeded parts of the story. The supporting characters were pointless as well. Like an Aunt who had about as much to do with the story as a toilet seat. I think there was only one point I jumped and there was next to no gore at all.Worth a watch, but don't get too excited.

                                          I have been a fan of the Fnaf franchise for years and like most fans, I've been waiting patiently for this movie to release for many years. Now that the movie finally released after 8 years of being in development, I finally got to watch the movie in theaters with one of my friends. Despite my friend enjoying the film, I personally left the film feeling incredibly underwhelmed and disappointed.Now, this film does have good elements, but I feel a lot of the bad outweigh the good. Firstly, the story in this film is really dull. I thought the film started solid but everything else after the beginning was dull, especially the side plot in the film. The movie is barely scary, the moments that tried to be scary literally made me laugh. The animatronics were the best part of the film... when they were actually a threat. I understand most of the lore in the games but what they did with the animatronics half way through rubbed me the wrong way. The actors in the film were okay but not outstanding. Same goes for the characters. Josh Hutcherson was solid as Mike but I kind found his character generic. Matthew Lillard was probably the best part of the movie, it's just a shame he was only in the film for only about 10 minutes. The setting for the film was cool but I knew I was gonna most likely like it. The ending to the film felt honestly rushed, would've benefited if it was a bit longer. The film could've also benefited from an R rating instead of PG-13.Overall, while I don't think the movie was terrible, I don't think it is good at all and was incredibly underwhelming. I am gonna be being completely honest, Scott Cawthon should not have wrote the screenplay. I would've preferred if someone else wrote the screenplay and Scott was a co writer or just a producer. Personally, I would only recommend this movie if you are a die hard Fnaf fan. Outside of that, I would skip this movie all together.

service who has played the games. The movie itself is uneven with its direction. Starting with a supernatural mystery film with Mike (Josh Hutchinson) suffering from nightmares about his past with his little brother. And having several same dreams of 5 children who have disappeared. The film gets repetitive with the dream sequences which slows down the pacing. Its a slow first hour start. When things do pick up. The film lacks the thrills and scares.The acting is decent. The cast ensemble is okay. The music score is cool. Does feel like a similar score that came off from Stranger Things. Its a film that has easter eggs and references to the games which fans will love. The movie itself is boring with an uneven direction and lacking the thrills.

The acting is alright, with the three leads of Mike, his Sister Abby and Vanessa being quite strong, and the rest of the cast, especially Steve Raglim, being aggressively unconvincing. Steve does have some funny moments, which is not uncommon in the film, as even though its a horror movie, there are a lot of good laughs as well. Youtube enjoyers will certainly enjoy seeing some familiar faces on the big screen. One thing that the movie absolutely nails is the visuals. Never has Fnaf looked more alive than in this movie. The team at Jim Henson did an amazing job with the animatronics, and they finally look as I always imagined then to be. Their movements are extremely fluid, and look straight out of a robot workshop. Their designs are fantastic as well, with Chica and Foxy looking absolutely incredible. The animatronics also work very well as both antagonists and deuteragonists. They are creepy, yet charming, intimidating, yet welcoming, which I think is perfect for the haunted animatronics that they are. Speaking of the characters, this is something that I am quite mixed on. Mike is done very well, the audience is given time to understand him, and he is both likable and flawed; a great main centerpiece to ground the story together. Abby is also a great addition. While her character can be simplified to a simple "little girl character", she certainly stands out in her own way. She is just as likable as mike, with a quick mouth and a smart mind. Vanessa is ok, but I just think the film did not give her enough time to develop as a character. We are told that her dad roughed her up, but thats about it. Her motivations, and deeper psyche are never really explored, which I think is a shame, since I think she could have been a great compliment to Mike. The movie even teases us with the possibility of exploring her further, with one solo scene of her just staring at a wall, but it never goes deeper than that, which I think is a mistake. As for the actual plot of the movie, this is where it loses me a little. I certainly appreciate the approach of giving the film an actual arc, and I loved much of the background behind the murders in the 80s, but the film is just very stereotypical and cliché. It is a story that I've seen around 100 times, and it really doesn't do anything very imaginative. Mikes character arc is good, but it is largely carried by how likable Mike is as a character, and his growth throughout the film is very predictable. There is also a considerable lack of tension for a lot of the movie, and the last act, where the climax takes place, is very, very short. The last thing I'd like to talk about is the horror, and unfortunately there just isn't a lot of it. The gore is very limited, and there just aren't a lot of very frightening scenes. This may be a big plus for some people, but for me, I watch horror to be scared. The film is clearly built with love, and really enjoyed the visuals and many of the characters, but I think the storytelling holds this movie back from being really great.

After losing yet another job due to an outburst of his psychosis, career counselor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) offers Mike a job working nights at the closed down family entertainment center Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. As Mike takes the position routinely sleeping and revisiting his recurring dreams of memories of his younger brother's abduction, strange occurrences appear to be happening in his new job that infiltrate his dreams.Five Nights at Freddy's is the long awaited film adaptation of the video game series of the same name created in 2014. With the initial video games becoming quite popular, development on a film began not long after their release with Warner Bros. Acquiring the rights in 2015 only for it to linger in development hell with a revolving door of creative teams and companies attached at various points. Eventually the film gained traction at Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 in spite of similar films like 2019's The Banana Splits Movie or 2021's Willy's Wonderland beating this film to release and trying to ride the franchise's coattails. After an 8 year journey to the screen, Five Nights at Freddy's looks nice but just doesn't have a compelling story or characters that made it seem all that special.To start off on a positive note, Five Nights at Freddy's is a very handsome production and considering it had more resources than Willy's Wonderland or The Banana Splits Movie it certainly can be seen on screen. The animatronics were made by Jim Henson's Creature Shop and manage to avoid looking like guys in suits and actually do feel like clunky heavy animatronics you'd seen in an 80s children's play place. However despite looking the part, Five Nights at Freddy's never felt all that scary and it didn't feel like there was much of a payoff. It's really not the film's fault that some of the novelty has worn off by being beaten to the punch by imitators, but even being imitators those films offered more in terms of memorability like the over the top gore in Banana Splits or Nicolas Cage's mute action hero performance in Willy's Wonderland gave those films that extra something to make them stand out. While Josh Hutcherson is clearly giving his all to the performance, Mike just isn't that interesting as a protagonist and my mind just went to other films that did this concept better some of which came from Blumhouse themselves. M3GAN from earlier this year had a stronger fractured family dynamic and more energy to the horror and entertainment value, and last year's The Black Phone did the concept of a serial child abductor and the victims' ghosts much more intensely. I was very much reminded of that William Brent Bell movie Separation from a few year's ago where it was mostly very stock (with the exception of one or two decent elements) and that's unfortunately where I fell on Five Nights at Freddy's.Five Nights at Freddy's might please diehard fans of this franchise with its attention to detail and plethora of easter eggs, but for me personally I felt underwhelmed beyond the animatronics and production design and I'd welcome a Banana Splits or Willy's Wonderland sequel before wanting one for this one (which they imply with no subtlety is happening).

grew up with the franchise, so I walked in hoping to at least enjoy the experience regardless of my expectations.. (I did not enjoy the experience)The jumpscares were mostly cheap to the point where people in the theater were laughing. The animatronics did not look scary, unlike the game where I used to have nightmares and call it quits after surviving only one night.I would only say that Josh Hutcherson's performance was great. I enjoyed the cameos too, more than the movie altogether.I'm just disappointed because, like I said, I grew up with the franchise and I was waiting for this movie ever since they announced making it... and it was not worth the wait.And for anyone who says it is a good film, I honestly doubt that we saw the same movie.

I never understood the back story this movie explains it well. As for horror or scares, the movie has minimal. Definitely needed more suspense, killings and jump scares. This movie lack em all. The PG13 rating hurt this movie severely. Need to step it up to R for the sequel. The characters had great potential to make something scary but didn't deliver. Every night got tougher but not this go round. The girl seeing ghosts was a bit confusing at first but played into the story which helped explain the other characters. The movie was good but could've been so much better with an R rating.

                                                              I love the FNAF games, and was so excited when I learned they would be creating a movie for the game franchise.The animatronics look very accurate and feel a bit unsettling, but sometimes they felt a bit goofy, in the games they are not like that so it felt a bit strange seeing them fort scene. Sort of split between whether or not I find this addition to be good, because on one side I prefer it when adaptations happen to not twist the original source material too much, but on the other side it helped emphasize the fact that there are children inhabiting the animatronics and they are easily influenced (thus why they would help William Afton perhaps?).The set also looked lovely, the sound and all of that was nice, I feel though that the story was a bit rushed. Overall the games and the movie don't go hand in hand plot-wise which can feel frustrating and confusing to fans of FNAF.The last problem I had is that, even though this is a horror movie it felt way too silly and funny. I feel like for a movie like FNAF they should have used a lot more jumpscares similar to the game. I did not feel scared at any point of the movie. Lastly, while I love Steve Raglan, that last line... just was not it. It felt so unserious and that whole scene could have been handled in a better way.

The story has basically 0 relation with the fnaf lore and tried to create NEW lore which isn't even true. (Vanessa being Williams daughter which is SO far from the actual truth it's painful) Sparky the dog had WAY too much effort put into it like for crying out loud it's not a real thing, the spring lock wasn't brutal enough as it should have been, who tf is Abby and why does the whole story revolves around her, why isn't there any doors mechanics, why is balloon boy in it MULTIPLE times (timeline doesn't make sense) because bb is in fnaf 2 which shows the original animatronics being withered and used for scrap parts so bb shouldn't even exist in this timeline, not to mention how the spring lock didn't happen til fnaf 3, in 2059. This entire movie was an entire joke. It's like the film directors just saw "dead children in animatronics let's make our own twist" like you can't do that. I waited a whole year for this mess of a movie. There was no scary parts, no jump scares, no true fnaf.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Honestly I wasn't sure I was going to review this movie but since I have a lot to say I thought might as well.Firstly I want to give my praise for the amazing practical effects from Jim Henson's creature shop. They really do look incredible, and it's awesome to see the animatronics moving around.Secondly I want to praise the direction, Emma Tammi seems like she knows what she is doing, the movie has a distinct look which I enjoyed.And lastly for praise I want to say Josh Hutcherson really gives it his all, he really carried what otherwise might have been a really boring protagonist. I actually really like what they did with his character. I really enjoyed the dream theory thing, and actually found it very interesting.Now to the negatives:Firstly the script itself, it's a mess. I feel like there was definitely a better script a few rewrites away, but alas this is what they went with. There are way too many plot points, and the movie feels unsure of what it wants to be. More time should have been spent fleshing out characters such as Afton, Abby and Vanessa. Characters like the aunt and her thugs could have been completely removed from the movie, their screentime could have been used on the other more important characters.Speaking of Vanessa, boy is she a badly written character, if you can even call her that. She exists to drop information. More time needed to be used on her to explain who she is. She also acts very inconsistently with one moment being happy and then in the next threatening to shoot someone.Next up is William Afton, such a waste of Matthew Lillard. He barely has a presence in the movie despite being the main antagonist. He needed more screentime so his entrance in the final confrontation isn't so random. In turn fleshing him out could also help give us more of Vanessa's backstory. Perhaps we could see her childhood and how William's treatment shaped her.Next up is the lack of horror. The movie isn't scary, and when I say that I mean like at all. I remember in one of the promotional videos Lillard said this would be full of jumpscares, yet I can only recall one. And it didn't even land since you saw it coming a mile a way. Also the lack of a creepy atmosphere really brings the movie down. The animatronics aren't allowed to act creepy, and most of their screentime is either spent in the middle of the film befriending Abby. I was also disappointed we didn't see a single scene of Mike just trying to survive the night like in the games.The final confrontation is rushed. Afton literally just appears out nowhere to taunt Mike. And then gets swiftly killed after Abby replaces a drawing of him with the kids with one where he is killing them.Honestly I hope they work to make the script more tight if a sequel is made, overall I don't hate this movie. And I actually quite enjoyed it despite all my problems with it. I'd give this movie a 6.5/10.

Five Nights at Freddy's games and for fans of a nice scary/mystery movieThis isn't a movie for people wanting an extreme horror movie or the next movie of the year who are ready to critique everythingThe movie is a departure from the games but that isn't saying much when the original game it's based on is just a guy sitting in an office for 6 hours while looking at a computer screen. The movie effectively used the little bits of lore in the first game and made an interesting story out of it.Set design was really good, lighting had many interesting moments, the horror aspect used the mascot horror effectively and the plot was decent. All in all it played to the strengths of the mascot horror genre while keeping the mystery aspect interesting.

                                                     Firstly I have to hold my hands up and admit at the outset that I'm not much of a fan of the horror genre and after watching this I remembered why. I also have to admit that I only went to see the movie so that I was out of the house on Halloween and I'd seen the other movies on offer. Why this is a 15 certificate baffles me although there is one stabbing incident in it, so. Halfway through the movie I assumed I'd misunderstood not having read much about it and it was actually meant to be a horror spoof because it wasn't scary for on nanosecond. I know it's based on a popular video game so maybe it's aimed at fans of that, but I'm struggling to think of a worse movie I've seen in recent years. I think it has to be up there in the top 10 worst films I've ever seen. When I see movies as bad as this I can't help wondering what the cast thought when they saw the finished movie. Horrified?

I agree with the reviewer that stated the film feels rushed at times. It does. I thought this film was ok, and that is being completely generous. I was interested very strongly in the first 30 minutes but that all faded away fairly quickly. I just lost interest because the plot just wasn't there. The storyline drags at times. Maybe the director and writer could have done a better job developing the characters so that the viewer remains interested but they did not so its just not as good as it could be. Sometimes hard to follow. I would say if you love thrillers give it a shot but you may be disappointed.



The sole purpose of coming to watch this movie is simply for the sake of the animatronics and because you're familiar with the games. So the story and the characters are not exactly the motivation for you to see this. Basically they don't matter to you. I'm sure most of us can be honest about that. If it wasn't for the animatronics at all, then why else would you be coming to watch this??It indeed was good to see Josh Hutcherson. Of course him being a B list Actor, we know him mostly from the major works of the past he was in such as: The Hunger Games, Bridge To Teribithia and Zathura. For him leading this movie, he did good. He's never been a person that overacts. It was also good seeing Matthew Lillard, whom we know as Shaggy from the live action Scooby Doo and Scream. The rest of the cast did their parts good as well when it came to acting, but the thing is...for me personally...I didn't seem to feel enough sympathy for either of them. I tried really hard to, but with the story not being the most engaging to me, it was hard to pay attention and really care for the characters. Plus, a lot of moments in here are quite predictable.The animatronics on the other hand were very well done! They executed the look of each of them perfectly! They look exactly like they are from the game and what makes it even better is that none of them are CGI. They are all real standing, moving animatronics. So hats off to that team for actually making them come to life! The Freddy FazBear Pizza Place in itself is also well designed. They managed to create the same look of the place, along with the classic monitor watching that we very well know of.While this is a film I probably won't watch again, I came to see it for the fun of the animatronics. And if you're coming to see this movie specifically with that mindset, then you'll have fun with it. But if you're coming to see it not for the animatronics, then I probably wouldn't bother with it if I were you. Therefore, I wasn't expecting this to be the best nor the worst. So it sits right in the middle just about where it should be. My real rating for this is a 5.5, if I had to grade it by letter, definitely a C+.

It's well made, the plot is amazing and of course the main cast brought it. Matthew Liilard is back on his game for sure and if your fan of his you will see some resemblance well you will see... I don't wanna give anything away.. just go watch that movie you won't regret it.. blumhouse really brought life to Freddy, Foxy, Cupcake, Chica, and Bonnie. I felt I was really there.. it's not gory but again it's spooky. The run down pizza place wow they took so much time and effort on those sets the details were absolutely fabulous.. I'm hoping for a part two at-least.

                                                           I thought it was great! It was a good mixture of all of the games with some newer elements and even some bits of new lore to explore further in future films.It was entertaining - full of fun easter eggs and cameos for fans, yet containing enough context through storytelling to help clue newcomers in without being too overbearing.Any "critics" who say it's bad are mad because it isn't another melodramatic, monochromatic film full of sorrow that's next in line to win an Oscar then fade into obscurity with the rest of the boring, monotonous films before it.This movie is for us, not for them. Don't let critics deter you from watching. If you like this sort of thing or even just find it interesting then good for you - I encourage you to give it a try. If not, then it doesn't matter. You don't have to watch it. But make that decision for yourself - don't let anyone else do it for you.

                                                             Five Nights at Freddy's is a horror movie that is based on the game series of the same name. It is written by Scott Cawthon and a few others and is produced by Jason Blum while also being directed by Emma Tammi. The film follows Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) who takes the role of Security Guard at the old Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, after getting fired from his old job. On his second night he meets Vanessa Shelly (Elizabeth Lail), a cop who knows a bit too much about Freddy's. On his third night, he brings his younger sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), to the pizzeria. He falls asleep on the job as usual and has the same, reoccurring nightmare about when his brother, Garrett (Lucas Grant), was abducted by a mysterious man. On his final night, Mike has to race to save Abby from becoming one of them. He is helped by Vanessa but she reveals who she truly is, and who the man that abducted Garrett and murdered the five kids was William Afton, her father. Mike stops the animatronics from hurting Abby briefly before William Afton (Matthew Lillard), in the SpringBonnie spring lock suit that he murdered the kids in, arrives and fights Mike. He tries to get Abby but is stopped by Vanessa, who he then stabs. While he deals with Vanessa though, Abby draws a picture to show the animatronics that William is the bad man who hurt them. The animatronics turn on William and the Cupcake bites at the suit, exposing the spring locks. The spring locks snap shut on William and he yells "I always come back!" before falling to the ground where he is then dragged away. Mike and Abby visit Vanessa in the hospital and the movie ends there. Overall, Five Nights at Freddy's is a great horror film with jumpscare's, comedy, shocking reveals and fan service for all the Fnaf nerds. The movie might not be for everybody and that's fine, but this is a movie that I wholeheartedly loved. 10/10 would recommend.

                                                                Anyway it's hard to write an exciting plot based on this game... I think this plot is more like a plot of some cartoon, not a film. However it's far different from the video game and for me was rather unexpected. Don't expect that the security guard Mike will be sitting in a room with CCTV through the film, he won't. Moreover, he won't be the only victim of animatronics.Except for Mike there was a police officer, who was also engaged in investigation of animatronics night activity for some reason (no spoilers at this point) as well as Mike's younger sister, who eventually was the one to get everyone in troublejust becauseofher own curiosity.I can't say it is a scary film at all. It only has about 6 screamers. Well, there also were some disgusting scenes at the end, but they are more disgusting, than scary. And in my view, they'd better didn't include them, as I find them disrespectfulfor the viewers.All in all, fans of the game can see the other, extended legend of what's happening in pizzeria. But don't think this will be a masterpiece. I would rate it as 6.5 out of 10.

Freddy's. And believe me, it was a disaster, a total disaster. I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this one, it was just terrible. The director couldn't direct their way out of a toilet. It was that bad.You know, I'm a big fan of winning, and this movie, it's a big, fat loser. I don't know what they were thinking when they made it. The animatronic animals, they were supposed to be scary, but they looked like they were made by a bunch of amateurs. It was low energy, folks, low energy.And the story, it was all over the place. I like a good story, a great story, but this one, it was a disaster. I couldn't even follow it, and I'm a very stable genius, you know. It's like they didn't even try.So, in conclusion, the Five Nights at Freddy's movie, it was a complete and total disaster. A tremendous waste of time. Don't watch it, folks, don't watch it. You're better off doing something else, something much better. Thank you, thank you very much!

Throughout the film there are intense and graphic bloody scenes, including scenes of dismembered body parts, dead bodies that have sustained grotesque injuries, and significant amounts of blood. There are many scenes of intense peril (most scenes are of intense peril, in fact). I was genuinely shocked at the amount of violence and blood in this movie, there was more of that in this PG-13 movie than in any other PG-13 movie I've seen , and even more than in some rated R horror movies I've seen. This movie has a higher on-screen body count than the most recent installment in the Conjuring franchise. I personally wouldn't recommend bringing a child to see this movie, unless they were a teen and/or has grown up watching movies of this calibre.

was she Aftons daughter and not Mike like in the games, there was barely and jump scares, the only one that actually worked was a door opening and that wasn't meant to be scary. And what was the backstory of micheal? Where was the bite??? I was very disappointed in the acting as well, Mathew lillard and Hutchens were the only good actors in this entire movie and Lillard was in it for like 10 mins!!! Where was the build up to the reveal??? Where was Henry??? Where was the backstory on the kids who went missing and Emily Henry. Where was she???

           I watched this in release day and as it started, I was reading film reviews about it. I see it has a high rating but that's where it's confusing to me because I don't get why. I know it's based on the video game franchise of the same name but even still, there's nothing about this film that makes it good. Especially for ratings that are 7 and up. I did see a preview of this beforehand but even that just wasn't appealing to me.This might be because I don't play video games anymore but this was just boring to me. It's really not even considered "horror" to me. It's more like comedy disguised as horror. It honestly was just weird to me, much so bland that I started to fall asleep during part of the movie.I didn't care for this one.

This movie has already made millions for only being cost $25m to make, exactly at this moment of me writing this it has made $295.9m closing in on $300m and is Blumhouse's highest-grossing movie. The movie is a different continuity then the games, think of it as a alternate universe then the games. This movie was made by, Scott Cawthon (creator of the games) & Blumhouse, the movie has been confirmed to get a sequel and possibly will become a trilogy. This is a must watch movie, I highly recommend you give it a watch and maybe check out the games as well!

That one was terryfiying but not too much; however compared with this a masterpiece.The story does not make a lot of sense and twists are too predictable; in fact being a PG 13 leaves most of the blood and language out.The horror is very basic and some moments really absurd; so do not expect to be scared; in fact sometimes is too tender for its own good.The actors do what they can and do not it bad; but evem for them some dialogs and scenes are too dumb to be taken serioustly.The special effects are fine but are not that used so do not expect much.

It's a confusing story with an outlandish story coupled with cringey campy dialogue and not being really scary. But in the eyes of a FNAF fan who waited 8 long years for this movie to become a reality... it's everything you'd hope and dream for! Like come on, a confusing convoluted story, that's basically the entire lore of Five Nights at Freddy's! The callbacks and references in this movie will make you want to stand up and cheer in the theater!The "horror" isn't exactly that scary but at times the movie does match the creepy and terrifying atmosphere the animatronic characters give off in the games but it's only in the beginning of the movie and one sequence at around the halfway mark when thieves break in and smash up Freddy's to get Mike, the current guard, fired. The animatronics pick them off one by one and at times can be fairly brutal.The star of this movie is easily Matthew Lillard, although it's criminal that he has so little screen time, his portrayal of William Afton is spot on and his acting skills show. One example of this is when Mike is being interviewed by William and as William reads Mikes file he notices his last name and freezes his demeanor changes almost immediately going from a normal career counselor dealing with another client to an almost nervous demeanor almost like he has something to hide from Mike (which we find out later William abducted and killed Mikes younger brother) and immediately offers the Security job at Freddy's. He almost seems desperate in having Mike take the job at times hinting that he wants Mike to go there to be killed so he'll never find out it was Afton who killed his brother. Later on in his final scenes Matthew truly shows off his ability to play this murderous psychopath ,as he has shown in his previous films, as he brilliantly brings the character of William Afton to life in the iconic spring lock suit. He even goes as far as stabbing his own daughter but Matthew portrays a moment of slight remorse and regret after doing so perfectly, and during his death scene he quotes Aftons most iconic line from the games "I ALWAYS COME BACK" although the line delivery is a little rushed ,come on, we've been waiting for someone to say that on the big screen for 8 years now! Matthew is the MVP of the movie for sure!The PG-13 rating does hold back the movie in some areas most importantly the spring lock scene which I will admit is a little too tame and bloodless for such a gruesome sounding death. An R rating would have really helped this movie convey the horror and sheer terror of these massive possessed machines but the movie does push the PG-13 rating to the limit in terms of violence and in a good way! One particular scene is when one of the characters from the aforementioned break in gets pulled into the mouth of Freddy and gets chomped in HALF! Even in the games this never happens so it took everyone in the theater by surprise but like I said before in a good way. Another scene shows one of the robbers getting there face chewed up by the Cupcake, and later on we see the gory aftermath.The other actors are fine there are some campy and corny lines but it's FNAF it's to be expected but no there is no "we are fnaf" scene but there is a scene where the night guard along with his sister and Vanessa, Afton's daughter, build a pillow fort with the animatronics. Yes it's campy and Bonnie even falls over and gives a thumbs up when asked if he's ok but it's important to keep in mind these are children possessing these robots and the movie needs a scene to get the audience to sympathize with them in some way before they turn on Afton at the end of the movie so this was the best course of action in my opinion.Overall the movie is perfect for fans and for me personally (a fan) it is a perfect 10/10 but for an average movie goer who doesn't know anything about the lore or what came before this movie honestly I can see why they wouldn't like this movie and rate it 4/10 or lower.

                                               The cast did a great job. Abby's actress was actually very good and adorable. I wouldn't change much about it. It was pretty erie. The music in it was rather creepy and weird and I actually liked it alot. The performances was great. Josh did amazing as always. The only thing I would change about it is the animatronics. I wish they were alittle less bubbly and more creepy looking. They were rather bulky. But I still enjoyed it nonetheless. The story line was very interesting. I wish there was more of an explanation to certain scenes, like why or how was the main characters brother taken specifically or why did the owner find him to get the job. But it was awesome! Perfect for a Halloween night.

                       Five Nights at Freddy's has absolutely no idea what kind of ride it wants to be. A movie that feels like it's been machine-learned and reverse-engineered from YouTube fanfic, rather than rooted in any kind of recognizable human experience, behavior, or psychology.There are moments where it feels like it could have become a more gleefully mean-spirited horror ride by really sinking its teeth into the story and actually biting down, but it remains hamstrung by the rating as well as a lack of creativity. Five Nights at Freddy's fails at being scary. The premise and setting should've made it an obvious horror win, but some baffling story choices and poor execution makes it feel like a missed opportunity.My Rating : 4/10.

and immediately goes to sleep. There isn't anything interesting to remark. Sometimes there's a classic Five Nights jump scare, but otherwise this is a bogus empty flick. I don't feel anything about the characters, and their development is uninteresting and not worth the tremendous effort. I would not recommend this to horror fans, ghost fans, video game fans, or even ceiling fans. On a side note, isn't it weird that Josh Hutcherson hasn't aged in, like, ten or more years? Anyway, this movie sucks. Animatronics look fun, but that's about it. Boo.

think I was pretty generous with my rating of 6.I found myself falling asleep at least three times throughout the first hour because honestly it was so boring to me, I kinda woke back up once it started to kick in properly but even then the storyline barely held my attention and I don't think I cared about what will happen to the characters at all. The twists were way too predictable and I guessed what they would be near the beginning which is probably why I fell asleep. That being said the acting was decent and the animatronics were pretty cool.

have no prior experience with Five Nights at Freddy's as a game but if this movie is any reflection of its quality, I'm clearly not missing much.The ideas aren't the worst on paper, there's a few effective moments here and there and there wasn't really anything wrong with the performances but the godawful execution totally tanks any interesting ideas that might've been behind this movie. It's essentially two movies in one and they don't gel well together at all. The iconic FNAF elements that people are going to want to se feel wholly and totally out of place in its own movie.The script chooses to focus on all the wrong things filled with sub plots and pointless side characters I frankly could not have cared less about. Any sentimental moments ending falling totally flat and come across as cheesy in all the worst ways. These animatronics never feel threatening at all and anything that comes close to a violent moment feels so tame in how it's executed that they never leave any impact. The script is chock full of ear scraping, cringeworthy dialogue and even knowing nothing about this IP I don't think there was a single surprise in the entire runtime.I had next to no expectations for this movie and I'm still baffled at just how bad this movie turned out to be. I might not have every played the game but if I had to guess I can't imagine fans really finding this story satisfying as an adaption. I just didn't care about anything that was going on and I was bored out my mind as a result Ans those are the worst kind of viewing experiences.

But I was baffled at how lame-brained and juvenile the writing and animatronic effects were. If this were a rated R film, I think we would have been gifted actual jump scares and a heightened sense of fear. About three times during the movie I was ready to just turn it off.Josh Hutcherson has never been compelling to me for his adult career. As for the relationship between Mike and his younger sister Abby, that was kind of cute. But excessive cuteness/cuddliness (such as the scene where everyone builds the fort) is guaranteed to spoil a supernatural thriller.A true let down.

I am by proxy. My other kids have grown up with it. They have always loved all things scary. So to say they were let down was an understatement. They actually called it "horrible". As an adult I tried to explain to them they had to make a movie that was watchable for everyone and not just the fans of the video games. That being said they were right. There is a scene in the middle of the movie, no spoilers, but it was just bad. Bad in every aspect. Another thing is, it was VERY rushed. They tried to get more story in than needed in their alloted amount of time. I'd give it a 5 for average. And like most other movie's there was so much that could have been improved.It is what it is. Another rushed Hollywood project cash in. I'm sure Scott is just happy to have it finally made but at the cost of true fans. My son was more excited by a certain cameo and close out song. There was no sexual content for the record. The movie is not scary. Some gore. Lots of cheesy bad. Since it was profitable before it was even released, which should tell you something about the rush job on low budget, there will certainly be another for them to cash in on.

                                         The fact u can't rate 0 stars is gross, the plot was garbage, the amount of cringe lines was said, it was not even jumpscary whatsoever, garbage. Whoever wrote it has obviously never written a script before, the directors forgot to tell the actors to act, and the one liners are so out of line it's awful, and did Matt part seriously make a cameo and say "it's just a theory" a peoce of me died in that moment. You've ruined my whole year with how awful this movie is, I pray to God you don't even ruin it more with a garbage time sequel. The ending was stolen from first novel book as well but wasn't nearly as good. Gross awful movie, script 1/10 costume design 8/10 directing 1/10 acting 2/10 plot -10/10.

                                                 Before the movie even came out, I read about what a let down it would be. The reviews here on IMDb have echoed the same chorus. But, especially since Future Man, I happen to enjoy Josh Hutcherson, so I knew I'd watch it.Unpopular Opinion: Five Nights at Freddy's is a pretty great movie.I liked the Saw-ish beginning with plushies, and I almost misjudged the movies based on the lack of gore (pulling punches in horror movies is a pet peeve). When it got into the story though, referencing the kidnappings in the 80s and the ghost children and all that, I have to admit that I really got sucked in. Oddly enough, the movie made me feel a bit deeply about what was happening.Based on that video game, this was a lot more than I was expecting. Not a bad movie at all. I enjoyed the direct references to the game and think the filmmakers did a great job developing the game's ideas into some scary stuff.

enjoyable to watch. Scary? No. Gory? No. Tension? You're not going to find any of that here. Drags on and on with the lame attempt at a backstory to make the main character sympathetic.Why was the writer so hellbent on making this about an abduction? It added nothing and sucked all the energy out of the film, making it drag on and on with almost no payoff in the end.It's hilarious that a movie based on a jump scare video game is taking itself so seriously. If you want countless eye roll inducing heartfelt monologues, than this movie is for you.

Absolute garbage.Instead of retelling the events of literally anything in the movie, they made more of an alternate universe thing. William is never mentioned by name, Mike's sister is now Abby, the crying child is named Garret, and Garret was kidnapped. Did any of this ever happen in the story? No, never. Mike isn't even related to William in this movie.Also, the movie is barely scary. They should've just went R instead of PG-13 and made it ACTUALLY scary.If you know nothing about FNaF, then you probably won't like this movie. If you are a dedicated fan who knows everything there is to know, you might not like this movie. If you're looking for a retelling of any of the lore, there's no hope for you.Don't spend your money or time on this movie. You will walk out of the theatre disappointed.

I was looking forward to watching a fun movie based on a classic horror franchise but instead what I watched was a rushed, poorly acted, sloppy mess of a film. I genuinely think that 400 monkeys on typewriters would pump out a better script then the finished product of this horrid movie. The only reason In was able to make it through this complete snoozefest was due to having friends to watch it with. I hope these directors can get it together for any future sequels because I do not want a repeat of whatever this thing was. This dumpster fire was a chore to watch and I would not recommend it, even to fnaf fans.

    I've been a fan of this franchise for forever, and this movie is... *Sigh*\nI liked the idea of the movie, but what the hell is this? Micheal isn't an Afton, which in the games, it was hinted that he was, the actors were amazing, and the production was great, but the storyline is disgusting compared to the games. Abby is a whatever character, she wasn't needed. But Garret? What did he have to do with anything? You could've at least named him Chris, or CC, like in the game. And Steve was the cover name for William? *Sigh*\nThey gave an uneeded storyline for what? And Vanessa's William's daughter? That feels like whoever wrote the movie was on acid or something. This movie was disgusting. Amazing graphics, amazing actors, horrible story.

                                        "Five Nights at Freddy's" starts alright, with a fairly unsettling atmosphere and a curious plot. The movie changes tonally after the first plot reveal about how the animatronics operate, but it still keeps its momentum and the plot still has the potential to entertain, since we're well past the horror at this point. However, the film just devolves into a mess after this, trying to tie its set-to-fail subplot involving the main character (i.e. Mike's brother) with several others (the missing children, Abby, Vanessa and her father) in a non-cohesive way. Each subsequent reveal just feels like an attempt to connect different parts of the larger story with more twists and turns, but it's very lazily done. It's not like the plot feels rushed at any point, some of these bits are actually too drawn out for their good. The second half of the movie is either boring or nonsensical at any given moment, and I'm left with more questions than answers at the end of the movie. The whole thing just feels contrived and not well thought-out; the story ultimately doesn't flow well. Couple the cliche-ridden writing with some wobbly acting and a very anticlimactic end, and I found myself staring at the rolling credits in disbelief as an annoying tune played in the background. The only consistent thing this movie has going for it is the visuals. I learnt that there are tons of easter eggs for fans to pick up, so... that's something. However, if you're not a fan of the games, do yourself a favour and skip this.

It is a movie based on the game of the same name. It is a nice story without pretension, with little or no blood.Despite the fact that the film is 16+ I think this is a youth film. So you are also watching a story geared to young adolescents. The suspense, the characters and the romance are tuned for this age.So it is about some mechanical dolls that take their own initiative and are sometimes very threatening. But there is more to it.So highly recommended for all FNAV adepts like my son and for people who want to see a friendly horror movie.

project made by fans of the games and a terrible video game movie adaptations of decades past.It manages to pay respects to the creepy animatronics in terms of appearance and lore (to a certain extent) but the movie severely lacks all of the new story elements made specifically for the film. A game can't just be simply copied onto the big screen especially the Five Nights At Freddy's Franchise where the story is told throughout several games and other media in a non-linear manner.For the uninitiated, Five Night's At Freddy's is about a security guard who is forced to monitor the night shift for Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a long-forgotten restaurant that closed years ago only to discover the animatronics are not as they seem.The movie tries to characterize the security guard by giving him a tragic backstory and a sister that he has to care for and protect but it doesn't work at all. The entire cast gives it their all but the writing doesn't do anyone justice. Important backstory comes across as heavy handed exposition at times and key information was withheld from other characters for no reason at all. Logic, a majority of time, is thrown out of the window and your mileage on ignoring it will vary.Five Nights At Freddy's only saving graces are the movie's beautifully haunting camera work, the iconic animatronics and popcorn-filled campiness.

everything around them when I was a kid, but lacking any nostalgic attachment, which turned out to provide me the perfect angle to approach this film from: I know enough about the original material and its lore to be able to understand what was going on, but experience a certain distance from it which allowed me to have an unbiased view. And let me tell you, the way this handles its story is absolutely terrible. This doesn't even try to walk the fine line of providing enough clarity for the unaware audience while entertaining passionate fans with hints at the bigger picture, instead it just ungracefully topples to either side of it. Either its overexplaining itself (the main character finds out about the whole 'kid ghosts' thing, spouts it to the audience as inelegantly as possible, and just accepts it as a fact in a single scene) or the background mechanisms take centre stage in what I imagine will be total incoherence to anyone not familiar with them. And that's without mentioning the awkward inserts of fan service that I imagine are what 'legacy hero stepping into the light' moments must be for people who don't know them. Revealing a character's last name doesn't mean a thing to the general audience, but it insists on its importance.The imbalance isn't reserved for only this, though. The tone itself is, to put it lightly, all over the place. In the same scene you'll have scares that are trying to be genuinely frightening (none of the jumpscares work by the way, and that's coming from someone who can usually be seen leaping in his seat) and a second later there's moments that would feel straight at home in a more campy version of this or are simply unintentionally hilarious (lots of examples to be found in Chica's cupcake, somehow the most capable force among the animatronics). It never dedicates itself to a single direction, so instead you get both laughable horror and baffling moments of levity. There's also about 20 minutes in the second half where everyone is just having a good time and it is without a doubt one of the most "what the hell am I watching" moments in recent memory.The unintended hilarity of the whole thing is only rivaled by how passionately the diehards are defending it, from the usual response to the low critics score on Rotten Tomatoes to a Reddit post I've seen where someone listed a bunch of now considered masterpieces that were not received well on release, citing, among others, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Fight Club as examples.During my showing the theatre crew was constantly kicking a bunch of kids out who were not old enough to see it (in the Netherlands it's rated 16+), but honestly, I don't blame them sneaking in anyways. This is definitely one aimed towards younger audiences (and Reddit manbabies, as it seems) who will uncritically chuck a 10/10 at this. For everyone else, however, this is worth little more than your usual Netflix Original horror flick or average Blumhouse fare.

                       I am certain fans of the games will get a kick out of this, Which they seem to like so good for them I suppose. However, it is no excuse for the poor storytelling and characters.The over reliance on dream sequences and dumb characters to move the plot is very tedious and the actual horror have taken a drastic backseat which is a shame cause I do like the first game atmosphere a lot. The actual villain is wasted and rushed at the last minutes of the movie which made the journey extra tedious to me(specially that it's very obvious who's the villain in a this called mystery movie).I really wanted to like this movie, I really did but it really didn't do anything for me. Still, go watch it and make your own opinion on it.

played any FNaF games, but I know enough about the franchise through pop culture to have expectations. I came to see evil animatronics stalk and mangle people in an abandoned pizza place. Instead I got what I get in many modern horror films: a 90 minute grief counceling session with bits of very light horror spinkeled in here in there. We spend hardly any time at Freddie's at all. We do spend a lot of time in Mike's dull and very repetitive dreams. And no, Nightmate Freddie does not make an appearance.This movie suffers from a serious case of script-itis. I get that the story needs some padding out to make it feature length, but things get so conveluted without getting interesting that the filmmakers completely loose sight of what we came to see. Killer. Animatronics.It's a real shame that the company that made the best killer doll movie in recent memory with M3GAN turned a beloved franchise with endless potentional into this terrible dud.

gateway horrorI think this is a perfect movie for kids who are wanting to watch something scarier than hocus pocus but aren't up for the conjuring.The story is of Mike (Josh Hudgerson), he gets a job to take care of his sister, the job is from a guidance counsellor (Matthew Lillard) doing night security in Freddie Fazbears, making sure nothing gets in...or out. With a disturbing past, Mike uncovers some secrets that line up with his past trauma that haunts him still, will he survive the night?Okay, so it's a 6 for many reasons, it's not bad it's just much more kiddy than I thought. The dialogue is a bit goofy and the music is, fine. There is a tone in the movie that makes it feel a little pulled between ideas, not sure how I feel about it.Josh was good, I haven't seen him in a while but he was a good fit as the big brother, the animatronics where cool, freaky at times but there was a section of the movie that again they felt goofy, still knowing they were actual props is very cool !!The end was a little rushed, I think fans of the game will enjoy it a lot as my cinema was screaming at certain lines hahaha lots of kids which is cool to see they are getting into horror early.I love Matthew Lillard, he was in this a small bit but was my favourite, probably will be a second if this makes a lot of cash hahaha fun family Halloween movie, 6/10.

As a FNAF fan myself, I think the movie is serviceable and fans will love seeing this come to life, much like I did.I loved the cinematography, the sets, the costumes especially and the design of the animatronics. They really nailed the look of this film. Freddy Fazbear Pizza had all the hallmarks of an 80's style pizzeria, and I loved the little nods to the games, the cameos from Youtubers and the visuals were great.Matthew Lillard stole the movie for me, he's absolutely perfect for this role and casting him as William Afton was a smart choice. He chews up scenery, he embodies the craziness of the villain from the video game series and while I did predict his involvement, I think introducing him this early and then potentially killing him off was a bit unnecessary.Despite me liking this film, I do have some negatives.I think Josh Hutcherson as Mike Schmidt was a huge miscast, the guy looks half asleep and bored in his role. He can't emote to save his life and upon seeing sentient animatronics, this guy is just so casual and chill about walking machines roaming about when he should be screaming his head off or running out of that place and finding a new job. He wasn't the worst, but I feel that his role should have been similar to the games, where he tried surviving each night for the paycheck and figured out unique ways to beat the machines, but that's just me. I also don't get why he couldn't ask any of his neighbors to watch his sister, this movie would not happen if he had been smart and left his sister with another babysitter.His little sister, Abby, was the worst character in this movie. She was so annoying, whiny and nonsensical. She feels like a pointless addition to this movie and I kind of find it icky that her potential autism is treated like some kind of magical gimmick. I also think she could have been cut from the movie completely and we'd not miss much.Vanessa's inclusion in this movie is peculiar. She's an alright character and services the plot well, and I like how she's related to Afton and lured Mike to the pizzeria due to her gaslighting abusive father's demands, but she has no chemistry with Mike and comes across like a manic pixie dream girl. If she's meant to be Mike's love interest, I hope a sequel film builds up their relationship if she ever wakes up from her coma. Also why is she a cop when she has other things to do when on patrol?Mike's aunt is a right see you next Tuesday if you know what I mean. I don't get why she wants to adopt her niece if she hates her so much. Even if she gets a check for taking her in, I'm sure any competent social worker would spot the clear emotional neglect were she to be in custody of her. I don't get why Mike would entrust her to babysit his sister when they both hate her guts, but that's how it is. Also, it makes no sense for her to hire people to ruin Mike's job when he's not duty. Why trash the place when he's not there, it made no sense to me.My biggest problem with this film is that the editing, sloppy pacing and illogical story beats feel like it's being taken too seriously. This movie should have been cheesy and embraced it's comical video game roots. It also should have been rated R and not PG-13. This kind of movie doesn't work when it's not gruesome or twisted. You don't need to be gory, but be tasteful with the death scenes.The ending reveal of the career counselor as Afton was great, but I don't get why this serial killer was so obsessed with this one guy and his family when he's killed other children before. I suppose tormenting him is the goal, but I dislike how underutilized he was in this film. He's the only actor who seemed to be enjoying himself, everyone else felt like a wet blanket.I wish this movie had a better script and story. There was so much potential for something else. I wish they had gone about scenes differently and it was proofread to make more sense, but for what it was, the movie was dumb fun and the fans love it, so I can't complain.

lore. It's complicated subplots and secondary character storylines that end up connecting to each other. All of which were absolutely ignored and vagely resembled the original source.Do you want to make a whole new thing, inspired by the games? That's alright (though I believe it's a huge missed opportunity), but we can work with that.However, the problem is, this movie does NOT stand by itsfelf. It has absolutely no idea what it wants to be.It starts as a drama, then turns into poorly animated gore, then suddenly it's a lazily written sitcom. This movie jumps into genres like it was Super Mario, and none of them really seems to fit.The plot is an atrocity. Spends 1/3 of screen time on a bunch of side villains that barely have anything to do with the main story. Until the script itself realizes it's a waste of time and gets rid of them.I could go on for a while, but it's not worth it. It's so bad it could be considered unintentional comedy.

"This is a movie for real people," they say. "Not elitists in ivory towers." Well, sometimes critics are right, and honestly I get annoyed that fans are so eager to line up for buffets of mediocrity and chow down like they're being gifted filet mignon. "Don't bother making any effort on our part," they say to movie studios, "we'll be satisfied with any crap you want to feed us." Wouldn't it be nice if we held filmmakers to a higher standard? If your favorite IP could be made into a movie AND that movie could also be, you know, good? It's not actually an impossible dream. You just have to stop licking boots.Oh, well. It's just a movie. It's not like lives hang in the balance, I guess. But they did get my money, so I think I have a right to complain.Whenever a much-anticipated movie takes forever to get into production, the excuse is always the same: the filmmakers are waiting for the right script. Then you see the finished film and think, "THAT was the right script? Surely at least one of the other two dozen options from the slush pile was better than this one." Five Nights at Freddy's suffers from a standard plot involving a security guard with haunted eyes trying to pull his life together so his aunt won't take custody of his younger sister. Yawn. But wait, if you were worried the dour protagonist doesn't have a Tragic Backstory, you're in luck! His younger brother (a different younger sibling than the one he's raising now) was abducted from a campsite when they were children, and Older Brother feels responsible as the only witness. Do his recurring nightmares about the incident tie in somehow with the current spooky shenanigans unfolding at the arcade-slash-pizza-place known as Freddy Fazbear's? If you think they do not, you've obviously never seen a film before.Despite the story being so thin you could use it as tissue paper next time you're wrapping a gift, the screenwriters (including FNaF creator Scott Cawthon and director Emma Tammi) stretch the rusty plot mechanics to nearly two hours. Why? Who knows? Even the pre-FNaF cash-ins like The Banana Splits Movie and Willy's Wonderland were smart enough to keep the action under 90 minutes. The film is chock full of characters that absolutely do not matter, like love-interest/cop Vanessa (fulfilling the obnoxious archetype of "character who knows more than she lets on about the scary goings-on but refuses to adequately warn the main character so he has no idea what kind of trouble he's getting himself into until it's too late for everybody") and waste-of-time-and-talent sneerfest Aunt Jane, perplexingly played by the overqualified '90s ingenue Mary Stuart Masterson. I guess everybody needs a paycheck. The screentime dedicated to superfluous characters ensures that our main protagonists, sadboy Mike and his preadolescent sister Abby, receive zero of the development necessary to actually make them interesting or complex.There's exactly one good scene in Five Nights, involving a group of intruders getting picked off one at a time by the animatronics. Tammi shows the aplomb of a PG-13 Sam Raimi, energizing the sequence with rapid-fire editing and kinetic camera movements and suggesting violence with shadows and abstractions that feel like fun artistic choices rather than concessions to the MPAA. Would that Tammi had been let off the leash more often. As we were treated to the umpteenth scene of Josh Hutcherson attempting to interrogate ghosts in his repeating dream, I kept myself awake by pondering why Cawthon was apparently so insistent that his hollow, schlocky video game premise be turned into this turgid melodrama instead of an adrenaline-fueled, no-holds-barred free-for-all. The final showdown, unfortunately, commits the greatest sin of all: anticlimax.My two notes of genuine appreciation for the film come down to the impressive, full-size animatronics created by the Jim Henson shop--thank God the film avoided CGI--and Matthew Lillard working his butt off to be the same gleeful scenery-chewer he was back in Scream, albeit with a much weaker character this time around. Other than that, I suppose I'm just glad the film avoids the same cynical, empty "wokespeak" that plagues other franchises aiming for Gen Z (not a self-conscious reference to "patriarchy" or "gaslighting" throughout the entire runtime, wonder of wonders). It's a tired movie, but at least it's merely tired in its old-fashioned storytelling rather than in a futile attempt to be up-to-the-minute as bait for "teh kidz".If you're going to see it, see it in the theater, with fans of the video games attending in full cosplay regalia, cheering at Easter eggs and applauding any moment that musters even a smidgen of genuine entertainment value. I did, and the atmosphere accounted for about 80% of the actual fun quotient of the entire experience.

                           This is not a cinematic masterpiece nor is it great. Its a fun movie that you would watch with mates or if you are a fan of FNAF.It would have helped if it featured more gore and possibly an 18 rating this would have added the horror elements that would make a good horror film. The concept of FNAF is not very scary to me. So I don't see the film as a horror movie but more as a thriller, maybe with horror elements. A few effective jump scares throughout the film but I wouldn't say I was filled with any kind of fear. Some moments have you questioning if you are even watching a horror film as it is more light despite the plot being fairly dark.The setting is amazing-the restaurant looks incredible, I'm sure game fans appreciated it a lot, the robots look great mixed with the sound which makes it perfect when we see them on screen, it all works so well together. As a fan of the games it really made me appreciate the film more due to these reasons.The films "twist" is some what predictable and almost called out earlier in the film. If you are going into this film blind without any knowledge of the games then you might be more surprised.The cast was good, Stu from Scream comes back as a creepy old guy, love it. Josh Hutcherson is great needs more recognition haven't seen him in anything big since hunger games.

story well. Everyone who knows the story lore knows it wasnt a disappointment, now with that being said i know other people moght not like or understand it as well IF and its a big if, they dont really understand the plot of the lore or anything in general. But overall i really enjoyed the movie and loved everything about it, nothing made me hate or dislike the movie in the slightest. Really hope we get another fnaf movie n the coming years. Beautiful piece of work this movie was, honestly. Cant wait to see what scott has in store for us next.

him to look so damn scrumptious, but oh boy i was wrong. The amount of times i paused the movie to make out with my screen was CRAZY. William afton shouldve been British, but since the American they replaced him with is so FINE, i wont get mad about it. He deserved that role as 1# dilf, and he played it well. And i just LOVED the 10 minute steam room scene with mike and william, it truly was an amazing experience. As far as other movies, they should have Matthew return for the role of springtrap. Anyway it was the best movie ever ong ong fr fr.

the biggest missed opportunities in modern horror cinema.FNAF effectively defined millennial and gen z video game horror in the 2010s. It dominated a decade with one long lore driven cannon that to this day entices and fascinates, for good reason. The depth and attention to detail Scott put into this world he created is ground breaking.FNAF the movie was something that would come out as an instant horror classic and a serious contribution to the genre entirely. With no right being poor in quality given the source material Scott made.I learnt something when I watched this film for the first time, something seriously important to me as an aspiring writer and director.It is often demanded by fan bases that original creators or creatives be brought onto adaptive projects to maintain not only the legitimacy of the adaptation, but also the expected quality. Scott Cawthon wrote the screenplay for the FNAF movie. Which doesn't even come into the same realm as the games he once created. This movie got me thinking that even a story's creator can lose touch and sight of what made his work beloved in the beginning. I'm not saying that's exactly what happened here. But this film brought me to the realisation that it's entirely possible.I have already said a lot so I'll just say that the FNAF movie is just a spooky movie, nothing more nothing less. It's a fast food horror movie, bringing nothing new in the shadow of the games it's based on. The simplicity that gave the original games their one of a kind tone and atmosphere, is entirely absent here. The film complicates and over explains source material that was perfect the first time it was made.All this film had to do was retell the games in a movie format. Keep it accurate to the games and don't stray unnecessarily. With that I don't doubt we would have had the next iconic horror franchise in film. That could have gone on to define the 2020s, just as the games did for the 2010s. However, what we got was a standard nothing movie that will fall out of relevance alongside most generic horror. In a manor very similar to the Scream franchise which I hold close to my heart.Looking back at the games and the impact they had coupled with the fan base they have established since. Compare that to what this film gave us. Dont tell yourself that it isn't a opportunity wasted.Have a good one.

The movie states it's PG 13 but I found it more to an adults taste in horror.The theme was fascinating as it was meant to be lovable. The stars are relatively unknowns but they held my attention with their acting skills. Most of the film is in one area but that's to be expected in a horror movie.The horror comes across suddenly and to my amazement I was shocked by it.Overall I enjoyed this movie and would have given it a TEN except for the having to write SIX hundred words to make a point. The movie, story, film was good. But really this volume of words is stupid.

I'm really glad that Scott was involved in the process of making this film and I'm glad that the Director treated this franchise with the respect that I deserve. Jason Blum did a really good job producing The film. The animatronics are amazing thanks to the Jim Henson Company. The Cameos were amazing as well I loved that MatPat was involved that was a complete shocker to me. He really kept that secret really good. I really did wish Markiplier was in there though but I understand due to scheduling conflicts he couldn't but it was still really great movie.

I have been a fan for so long this was my childhood and I'm still a big fan but honestly what was that... the animatronics building a fort with a child??? Mike not being Williams dad? Also when did vanesa get there... loved the experience to go to the movies with my friends but this is so lore inaccurate, trust I still love the franchise and fnaf in general but this was just disappointing like Scott come on... I was promised gore and all I got was some scars and a close up of the spring lock with barely any blood, I wanted it to be so bad that it was rated for mature audiences, just why??

Personally I never quite bought Josh Hutcherson in the Hunger Games franchise, but that was probably because next to Jennifer Lawrence and her charisma and star quality he looked like a joe Schmo from Idaho.I thought he was good in this, a broken every man again but in this low key project he works\nThe subject matter is dark, very dark and the situation however absurd connects perfectly with the subject matter, only Blumhouse don't follow through as with so many of their movies, it shows promise then weakens, and ends up Meh\nBut for two acts it's promising if lacking in some much needed gore, we did Hammer we don't need Hammer, give us some pay off, we don't see any body or rather baddy get any comeuppance, and they do obviously just want to make another so they forgot to actually just make a great third act, in a way the premise got too uncomfortable for them and they bailed, I genuinely thought I'd hate this, but I didn't, in the end I was disappointed because I liked it and the set up, the subject, the scenario, could have been great, it could have been The Shining but it wasn't even Chucky! Blumhouse seems to have a blueprint for a middle of the road product that doesn't rock too many boats, and so studios feel comfortable with their low budget safe box office fayre, it's a great business model but makes for run of the mill cinema.

It was stupid and pointless. Glad I saw it on peacock then go to the theater to watch it. I expected a better story to this movie. The trailer makes it seem so scary but the real viewing experience makes the perspective less interesting by the minute. The acting was so weird especially by the little girl. The writing to this movie looks like there's a fear of Chuck E. Cheese. I bet the video game would be more enjoyable than the movie. What's the point of this movie anyway? Truly this is a wild imagination. I'm surprised anybody enjoyed it. No little kids should watch this. This could traumatize them for life.

Unpaid critics. Being an 80s child, I was njoyed the nostalgia. Ripped from chuck e cheese but a fun fare. Funny it was written by a hard core Christian( not too much bible pushing). We all got to pay bills amirite?It was actually very well written and directed and edited. I brought the kids and they loved it but I did too. I caught myself nail biting a couple times( 40yr).I do recommend. Especially if you want to see a movie. It's in-depth and detailed. Good acting. Corny at times but it's not all about the acting it's about the awesome animatronics. They put a lot into this flick.$$$. Good story.

Where was the lore. Where were the jumpscares. Why did they build a pillow fort. I get that the animatronics were just kids and i appreciate that the movie humanized them and emphasized on that but i hated the vibe of "let's all come together and stop springtrap!! Together..we are fnaf!". Like i remember being genuinely nervous while playing the games and i don't think that that same thrill was conveyed to the movie. I appreciate the attention to detail and the little easter eggs hinting at things from the games, like shadow freddy and sparky, and the fact that they did that showed that they were 100% able to make the movie less like a teamwork and friendship movie and more like a horror/psychological thriller. Even though they were just kids, they were also killing animatronics. They turned against william so quickly because apparently the answer to all of this was a drawing? I wish there was at least mention of the security cams having limited battery, seeing them pop up in the cams more, but the only real good scene in that nature was when they went for the people that broke in. Objectively not a horrible movie, but disappointing.

                    I think there was A LOT of expectation I heard of the games, watched some gameplay saw the hype all those years back and so the stakes were high!Does this movie deliver? The costumes are well done CGI, the mood of the early 00s is there too aaand that's pretty much it. The jump scares and not scaring, the story is SO GENERIC literally every single plot point is visible from the first 10 minutes and not even the twist in the end is twisting. I watched it on double speed and was still a little bored..It might be a great movie for children without the 2 gory scenes and with them included I feel like this is for the people that loved the let's plays and games/books and are now in their late teens/early twenties. It's about the characters not the story or horror elements. Just nostalgia for that fangroup.For everyone else I wouldn't recommend. I liked seeing Josh Hutcherson again but that's not reason enough to recommend.

      The movie was just so disappointing, the creators promised a lore accurate movie with a lot of jumpscares. There were some lore accurate parts, but mostly it was just messed up and random stuff was added. Like for everyone who knows the games and story, it's frustrating. Like the story of the movie was patched up from different games, but I think it was supposed to be like the first part. The movie wasn't scary at all, almost no jumpscares. Everything that was scary in the game was just taken away. The whole vibe, music and sounds. It was just a generic horror movie, very predictable. The movie overall wasn't very good, even for people who don't know the story and for the fans who have waited for a long time, it's just disappointing.

faithful to the game! It made you feel like you were inside the game because of the intense uneasy feeling it provided. The animatronics were breathtaking to look at. I loved that the Jim Henson Workshop did a masterful work to make the animatronics puppets instead of CGI. I loved how they used the lore of the dead children possessing the robots, which added an otherworldly feel to the film. Josh Hutcherson was amazing as Mike Schmidt, he was a very complex and emotional character. My favorite performance was Matthew Lilliard as William Afton! He was perfect for the role because he was both charismatic and terrifying to watch! I got the chills when he was onscreen! My only complaint is the dream plot felt a little unnecessary and I wish we would have gotten more scenes at the pizzeria with the animatronics. I also wish Abby's ability was explored more because it was a little confusing at times, but other than that, it was a phenomenal movie!

                                             Brilliant, made exactly how it should have been. Everything was perfect 😍. Scary,funny,sad it was all I could have asked for and more. Can't wait for the other movies which there hopefully will be 🤞 perfect film. Any FNAF fan should be proud of what has been made and will love every moment thanks to the clever hidden details and certain scenes. Even if you are new to the franchise this is a fantastic horror made by the incredible BLUMHOUSE. The scares are sure to make you jump and the plot is great too. Honestly couldn't be better. Seeing the iconic animatronic characters come to life is truly incredible and almost like a dream come true from being such a big fan. It's a must watch for anyone.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I went into the theater with high expectations, but it isn't what I thought. The designs are cool and Michael Afton was a good character but should've gotten more screen time. While the designs were cool they brought in characters from other games. They brought in Vanesa who was really the only one, and the animatronics should've have gotten more screen time. They showed the same flash back like 10 times, the story was also a hot mess. Vanesa was poorly written, Their was a lot of talking during the movie, and for people who don't play the games had it rough. The people who don't play the games are probably wondering why would you were a suit that kills you, why are their two Freddy's and it may be tough for them. Foxy was the only one that was lore accurate and their wasn't much goor at all. Their was no screaming from the spring lock scene, no blood, it looked like he was busting a nut, and his fraise "I always come back" was cringe he only died once like shut your goofy up. I know they want the younger fans of the games to see it because the fanbase is mostly kids but the springlock scene was so PG. This movie was terrible. Trash Movie.
## 224 To preface this whole thing I do actually really like the franchise, and have been a pretty big fan ever since I watched Markiplier play the first game when it was still a one night demo in 2014, so no one can say that I'm not a "real fan" for my opinion on the film. Since that is pretty much the only reasoning/defense I have seen from people about why this movie is good and why people who do not agree are "wrong". I have also been waiting for this movie ever since it was announced to be a thing almost an entire decade ago at this point, and I kept up to date with it through all its delays and cancellations and the prospect that it was never actually going to happen because Scott couldn't settle on a script and his announced "retirement" a couple years ago, but just because I waited so long for this movie and really do like the source material (up until help wanted, all the books are pretty good though) does not make the movie any better. While I am happy that it happened, it wasn't a good movie, it was incredibly mediocre at best, but it did have some cool moments.Another thing, oh my god is the FNAF fan base one of the most annoying things I've ever had the displeasure of being in a movie theater with, they just never shut up, everything that happened in the movie was like the most insane thing they've ever seen in their life they wouldn't stop talking and going "ooooo". I've never been surrounded by so many obnoxious incels at once before, it's like they've never been in a movie theater before and I wouldn't be surprised (iykwim). There's seriously no reason ever to get up and clap in the middle of a movie and start talking because you got a reference to something, just shut up and sit down, learn how to act around normal people.Now for the movie itself, it's seriously one of the worst movies I watched that came out this year, it wasn't bad in the typical ways movies are bad. It was just so insanely boring, the majority of the movie had absolutely nothing happening but man sleep and fight with his aunt for the custody of his sister, which is insane to put into a movie about robots possessed by little kids murdering people because they're being manipulated by the man who killed them. The only actual entertaining parts of the entire movie were all the references and Easter eggs that they put into it, and while I do find it cool and did appreciate those nods that is not enough for a whole hour and fifty minute long movie to be good. I enjoyed seeing the references and cameos and Easter eggs that were there but that's pretty much all it had other than a pretty decent start and a fun ending, the entire middle of the movie was just unnecessary and a snooze fest.The parts I did like were very spaced out and only lasted a few seconds because they weren't actually a part of the plot (other than my boy Matthew Lilard, he was amazing). Like the Matpat and Coryxkenshin cameos were awesome and made me smile, I'm glad that they got into the movie since they're such a big part of the fandom. I also liked the Easter eggs like the "it's me" appearing on the security monitor in the one scene, the whole ball pit thing being a reference to "into the pit", the hiding from Foxy in an arcade being similar to a sequence in "the silver eyes", the living tombstone song at the end, the 8-bit opening, the bite (which was kind of cool but it being entirely in half was goofy), and the whole "I always come back" quote (which I have a problem with ill get into in a minute) but that was all the film had. The story itself was lacking any substance and the characters were boring and bland. I know that they banked on the references and cameos bringing "true fans" into the theater who would defend the movie with their lives but those people are just blinded by their love for the franchise.Other than that, the only thing the movie had going for it was Matthew Lilard as Willy Afton, he slayed in that role for real. By a long shot the best part of the entire movie was his performance, especially at the end when he's in the spring Bonnie suit (which I do really like the design of the suit they nailed that and the rest of the costumes), but he only had like 10 minutes of screen time which really felt rushed, they totally could've had him play a bigger role in it and that would've made it much better in my opinion. I do have a problem with the infamous "I always come back" from him though, not that he said it weirdly which he did, but why did he say it at all (I know it was to get a reaction out of the fans because that's all the movie was) but it seriously doesn't make an ounce of sense for him to say that in that scenario. Like what is he even talking about, when he has come back before, what has he come back from, why is he coming back? It was super out of place and didn't mean anything in the context of the movie, they should've saved the line for when he actually CAME BACK in the sequel or even in the third movie because they're probably gonna kill him more than once it's kind of his thing. The rest of the acting was decent enough I guess, the little kids did an alright job for kid actors (except for the little girl she did a strange job), Josh Hutcherson did pretty good as Mike Schmidt, and Vanessa's character was pretty okay, she was like weirdly bipolar with how she treated them and how much she cared whether or not they got hurt or not. Like one second she'd be super friendly and the next she'd be threatening to shoot them, like girl pick a side (I know her dad is William Afton which was such a funky decision to make but she was still super back and forth on whether or not she was helping her dad or not). The actors who played the animatronics also did really good at portraying robots, so props to them.The changes they made to the lore as well weren't bad but just felt weird, like why make Vanessa Williams daughter? What's the point in doing that other than to make it different than the games. Why add these new (pretty boring) plot points/characters like Abby and Garret (and garret im pretty sure they're gonna try and make the Puppet which is eh). It just felt disjointed to market the movie as "just for the fans who know all the lore and will understand and the references" and then change up the lore.Another complaint about this movie is the fact that for a horror movie, it is probably the least scary horror movie I've ever watched, not just because it was pg-13 which would've been fine if they had just you know filled the movie with easy jumpscares, which is pretty much all the games are, but they didn't. For a movie based on a game franchise about getting jumpscared, the movie had like 5 jumpscares, and none of them were good, the only ones that were kind of unexpected were the gag ones they did with the toy balloon boy which is depressing. I didn't need the movie to be rated r and filled with blood and gore (it should've been just for the spring lock scene alone) but they didn't even take advantage of the "horror" they could've added. Which is so disappointing to me, they really could've done a lot more to make the movie better but just settled for mediocre with a ton of fan service because they knew it was going to make them a lot of money.I really wanted to love this movie, I loved the games and even the books for a large part of my childhood and had been waiting a long time to finally see a movie adaptation on the big screen, but sadly it was a real letdown for me. It just felt like they didn't care about making a good movie, but instead cared about how to get die hard lovers of their franchise to dump money into it and ignore how bland it is just because it has the I. P. attached to it. For a movie it's one of the most boring I've watched, with basically no substance to its story, and even as a FNAF movie it's still not that great. It's just amazingly alright, I can't hate it but I definitely can't love it. I hope they make it better with the sequel.

just heavy in it it feels like such a great adventure at the same time it feels like a big mystery and it really takes a hold of you in terms of how the story is played out and you get to really love Freddy and the friends and how great it is because it's just the movie like nothing else in terms of the elements of the atmosphere everything involves into this movie it takes you and grabs you and just sucks you right in because it's his own universe that's unmatched by anything I've ever seen and it's amazing to watch this and just enjoy story!!

Sure it had its positives, like the animatronics looked really good, and I liked the actor for Vanessa and Mike. But I stopped watching the last thirty minutes because im so confused and mad.First off the inside of the pizzeria was such a let down, it didn't have any of the iconic game elements, such as the drawings on the walls, the party tables, the telephone guy, and the backdrop for the stage that Freddy stood on. Secondly, what is going on with the plot? Who are Mike, Abby, and Garret, and when did they become important..? Along with the aunt, the babysitter, and the nervous lawyer?Not to mention the kills are cheaper than five below, it's one thing to have an off screen kill, but all of them besides the babysitter are off screen. In the game the security guard is killed with a jump scare, they could have added that to the movie, especially since the jump scares are such an important part of the games. The jump scares didn't need to be directly aimed at the camera like in game, but just a few jump scares, to help build the tension would've given the movie that scary sense.The whole movie was all over the place, and really cringy at times, like when they built the fort. Why would deadly animatronics build a HORRIBLE looking fort for some random girl thats not even apart of the lore? Not to mention the girls character completely sucked and just screamed "look at me, im special! I talk to animatronics that kill people and they absolutely love me!! UwU!!"The special effects sucked, I've seen tik tok artists do better black eyes and tears. The movie lacked a ton of scary elements, shock factor, which is disappointing when they had multiple chances to add elements from the game but they didn't, which ie shocking because scott himself worked on the movie and made the games!

I disagree. The story was very good with a slow boring start. But everything changes as the film progresses. The ending is completely epic. It doesn't include all aspects of the lore, which was impossible in a two-hour movie. I don't care what others say, for me it was a super good movie. It wasn't very horror, but hey, FNAF became so famous because of the story.The actors played quite well, especially Matthew Lillard. He knew what William Afton meant. Vanessa's death was kind of unexpected, honestly. And the comedy part of the movie was also good. Some complain that the comic part shouldn't have been there. Bro, even the games had some funny parts. In the end, my opinion, as with other games based movies, is that people complain too much. The movie pleased me beyond measure, and I'm a big old fan.

                                            Let me preface by saying I'm a fan of the horror genre, and have been watching "Scary " movies for over 45 years.My 26 yr old daughter and I have been going to watch Horror movies since she was 14. When we went to see the New Exorcist we saw the trailer for Five Nights at Freddie's.I was immediately psyched. Her and I were like a Demonic Chuck e Cheese from Blumhouse. We we're extremely disappointed. If it was worse perhaps it could've been funny.I gave it a 4 purely for the Animatronic characters and premise. Otherwise the script was horrible. Some reviewers claim the rating of PG - 13 doomed the movie. More blood and gore would've saved it. Wrong a better script would've.2 better PG-13 movies this year we're Megan and the Conjuring. Better storytelling. In fact let's talk about what is scary? Not jump scares that's a cheap trick perhaps used once or twice. Suspense, the Unknown, tension these elements cause fear.For the younger or less knowledgeable fans of the genre watch "Night of the Living Dead", " Alien", even "Signs". Great scripts and stories and low on gore and violence all SCARY.

I don't care what anybody says, this movie does everything a movie like this needed to.For starters, all the acting is on point. The cast of human actors surprisingly isn't the biggest, but they all nail their roles perfectly. And the animatronics, let me tell you disney is shaking, cause they are super life like.The movie plays around with different ideas and pieces of the lore, and fits them in to tell a new story. As much as I love FNAF as a game series, making that all a movie would be a mess, So to scrap that and just give us the essentials, and then build on top of those essentials in new ways is great.I'll end it here but hardest recommendation ever. There are many things I did not mention, but honestly please watch for yourself to see them.

The story was super out of place, like literally, knowing the lore, it was ABSOLUTELY made up. Lore inaccurate, even one of the names was changed for some reason. The movie makers were trying WAYYY TOO HARD to create a horror film but just made cheap jumpscares and a boring story.Spoiler!!!!! Spoilerrr!!!There was no Puppet or Golden Freddy, only some cheapass Baloon boy jumpscares xdThe springtrap failure was the most disappointed sh.. EVER. My guy is getting his bones and guts smashed and doesn't even make a sound??? No blood whatsoever. It was also lore inaccurate.

9 years of fun and good moments reading the books and playing this game, and my honest reaction when I saw just 10 minutes of the movie was "why?". I know the movie has some things that are part of the lore of the books and games, but they have zero coherence. I dont get how Scott could mess up the movie with that plot twist. Vanessa wasn't even a fetus when the springlocks scene happened. William had 3 kids, of which 2 of them for the springlocks moment were already dead. Mike Schrit wasn't William' s son, like WTF. The animatronic were just like the memes in the last part of the movie. Everything from this movie has no coherency. The only thing I liked was the acting, and the designs of the ambience (the animatronics, the pizzeria..etc).

most of the time, I kept my expectations for this movie low on purpose.Despite this, a very small part of me was hoping this would be a character based drama/horror with a focus on the messed up story

setting.Cons: Incredibly convoluted story with many missed opportunities, rushed ending, lack of horror, jumpscares don't work at all, PG-rating, poor decision making from characters due to a terribly written screenplay.As someone who is only familiar with FNAF on a surface level, this movie just didn't work for me.However, some fans might disagree, although even the most hardcore lore fans will have to admit that certain elements or parts of the movie just don't work.If they ever make a sequel, I just hope it's better than this. This one gets a 5/10 for me.

Good Story And PlotThis Movie Made You Think Who Stolen Mike's Brother, But It Was The Same Guy Who Put Mike In The Job At Freddy's Fazbear Pizzeria In The First Place.2. Awesome ForeshadowingThis Movie Was Telling The Viewers That Whatever The Person Does, It Helped Them In Dangerous Situations.3. The Music Is Too HypeAt The Beginning of the movie, The Music Was Too Over Used,\nI Mean When I First Heard It, You Could Possibly Download The Music And Just Remixing Your Own.4. That One SceneAt The Mall Scene, It Could Maybe Be More Deep Instead Of Showing The Cuts Between Scenes.

                                              Scott Cawthon's popular video game makes its big leap to the big screen thanks to the king of modern horror cinema Blumhouse. Making a film adaptation of Five Nights At Freddy's was really easy, since the video game is not complex at all. It's a pretty simple story that doesn't need much explanation and the movie does it well. Mike's trauma contributes enough to give mobility to the plot and manages to link it with the events of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The design of the animatronics is amazing, respecting the characters of the video game a lot. They look adorable and scary at the same time. Using practical effects was a great success instead of using digital effects and adding the retro style that Freddy Fazbear's Pizza has makes the film have an eighties feel. Also, one thing that is clear is that the animatronics are actually not as evil as they used to be painted. In fact, the film gives a good justification for the actions of the animatronics and relates quite a bit to the dark past of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Even the famous song that was composed by The Living Tombstone already gave a clear explanation in the lyrics. The video game has always been characterized by its jumpscares and the movie has few jumpscares, but the concept of Five Nights At Freddy's goes far beyond that. It's not exactly the kind of horror movie one would expect to see since it's pretty soft. It is more of a horror film aimed at a child audience that really works perfectly. The Five Nights At Freddy's video games were always aimed at children and adolescents and the fact that the film is aimed at that type of audience is a success. It is quite faithful to the source material and maintains the games' level of suspense. Five Nights At Freddy's is another great achievement for the world of video game adaptations and a nice movie to enjoy with the entire family. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.

        I came into this movie during opening weekend with an open mind. I knew a bit about the five nights at freddys lore and played a few games but I'm not particularly a huge fan.I'll start with the positives, the visuals were very well done throughout the film. I found the cinematography to be the best part of this film. Another aspect I have to have credit to is the animatronic designs and the way they are presented on screen.The biggest problem I have with the film is the plot. I find that it was sequenced very poorly throughout the story. I didn't find myself interested in the story behind the main characters brother as I wasn't interested in him nor the rest of the characters. I found that my attention was focused on the next time I would see one of the animatronics. The characters were bland and uninteresting especially the police officer.The movie ends in a twist that, if the rest of the movie had been good, may have been surprising.My last problem is that the movie pays 0 homage to the video games that the movie was based on and I can't imagine how die hard fans of Fnaf feel about this lazy attempt of a blockbuster movie.

genuinely surprised by how well done this movie is. The acting was superb, Hutchinson obviously being the stand out but the others as well; I thought it was well written and those mechanical suits were insane! So well made, expressive, and interesting to watch. It was great they released the movie on streaming so I could watch after my shift. I'm a huge fan of horror movies, from old films to international ones, especially the avant garde - and I'd recommend this one to plenty of people. It's heartfelt, funny, and does a good job of making you like the characters and fear for their lives.I cracked up laughing the first night when Mike just goes to sleep, I feel like I would have done the same working a (supposedly) boring night shift. There's a lot of scenes that I never expected but was pleasantly surprised by, like the fort scene. And Springtrap/William Afton's arrival had me gasp, even though I had known it was coming it was still well done!

It was pretty good! They stuck with the original lore of the animatronics being haunted from the children that were lured and murdered (I feel like a lot of people didn't understand the story to the original games)\nKeep in mind, this is a horror movie directed towards teens, so it's not as gory as saw, but it had some good jump scares and creepiness to it. Being the game is an indie game and doesn't give the player a lot of freedom, they used the original lore and created a fun story out of it. Sure, it has flaws as every movie does, but I went in expecting the movie to be dog crap, but I actually really enjoyed it. Not perfect by any means, but it wasn't bad either. I plan on seeing it again!Advice? Watch it! Especially if you're a lover of the original game!

The animatronics, the characters, and basic lore of the game franchise are done justice in this film and so much is left unanswered for sequels. Personally, I have only played the first game and looked up videos explaining the lore and the fan fiction. And this film met my expectations exactly! It even had good cameo appearances of YouTubers who became big from playing the games on their channels (though I won't mention them).I admit, there are plot holes and dumb decisions made in this film but in all honesty, the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise has been pretty well known for being campy and cheesy. In fact, that is the basis of each game's gameplay mechanics with the limited power and unsafe demeanor of Fazbear Entertainment's locations. Overall, this film is a must-see for fans of Five Nights at Freddy's.

A 30 minute introduction of the protagonist showing in excruciating detail why he needs the job. I was worried, walking into the theater, it was going to be nonstop, homicidal, animatronic action. Luckily that's only a very small portion of the film. The real story is about a young man trying to raise his orphaned sister and overcome a tragic past. You might be mistaken, and think the villain is some sort of supernatural animatronic bear or an evil corporation that owns the arcade. Fortunately these are professional writers and producers. No, the real villain is his evil aunt. Not the murderous machines living in the decrepit arcade.. It's some woman and her lawyer. What a twist!I'm now about halfway through the movie. I really hate it. Like, before I could make light of it, but now I'm just disgusted.What I learned from this movie is childhood therapy is pointless. If you have a kid that's withdrawn, the best way to break them out of their shell is for them to see a mechanical monster kill their evil aunt and torture a crazy man in a bunny suit. You might think that would mess a kid up, but according FNAF lore it's really therapeutic.

the Five Nights at Freddy's game series for so many years now and I was thrilled to hear it was turning into a movie. In game to film adaptations I usually tend to be sceptical about how good it will turn out. I was also unsure about how Josh would do in the lead role, but I was wonderfully surprised- he did a stellar performance. The animatronics were what I was most excited about and I'm blown away by how great they looked on screen. It was so hard to remind myself that the animatronics were real puppets because they looked so good. There's not a lot of practical effects in movies anymore, most things like that are just CGI now. The movie blew my expectations out of the water. I've watched it multiple times now and love it more each time.

       Yes, I gave it a 10/10 and I would have rated it 7 if it wasn't for the people giving it low ratings due to lack of gore or "I don't know anything about this."\nYes, lack of gore to get a PG13 makes $$ sense. Movies are here to make money, it's a business like anything else and they need to recoup their losses, and expanding the age tp see a movie does just that.Rating a movie low because you don't know the background? Dumb.This movie was fun, delved into serious territory with child kidnapping and had some fun jump scares. For an app game to be made into this is pretty good. It's a fun movie that on the surface you don't have to think too hard, but has layers to it that you can pull back if you want to read more into it. It did well without all the gore, and if they make an R rated version great, but not necessary.Spoiles:\nOnly gripe was knowing who the bad guy was right away. But the fort building scene was so cute. Solid fun!

in which the extras are located. However, all this looks too exaggerated and absurd. The main character, although he has suffered a tragic loss, does not have a pronounced personality, which leads to his confused and hypo-optimistic behavior throughout the film. Originally intended for a teenage audience, the film contains violent scenes that make it unacceptable for viewing for this age group. On the other hand, it is of no interest to adult viewers, because it is built on the principle of ghosts and lacks logical coherence of what is happening. The actions of the extras in animatronic beast costumes are very slow, but when the dolls become invisible, they suddenly acquire supernatural speed and the ability to manipulate door locks. I can safely advise you to refrain from watching this movie, because it can seriously disturb your mental state. At the same time, it is worth recognizing that its cinematic component is competently executed.

so highly regarded by an army of devoted online fans again - until the sequel is made at least. It's made for fans to do the Leonardo pointing meme at the screen for the rote references/ cameos and nothing more.Such is the fan power to thrust a "horror" adaptation that is so disinterested in trying to use what made the first game a viral sensation - possessed animatronics hunting and jump-scaring an almost helpless security guard - in favour of tedious amounts of justification for nonsensical plot points and lore exposition dumps that drag the pacing to a crawl. None of the twists surprise, all heavily predictable or meaningless (or entirely expected by lore gurus) while every jumpscare attempt pales in comparison the games. Freddy and co might be impressive practical recreations but they're utterly stiff when visible, only actually able to attack when off-screen which leads to an unintentionally hilarious dream sequence. They just don't do much given their capabilities, and the cupcake gag becomes overplayed. There didn't need to be gore to be scary - just good directing, writing, staging and sound, none of which is here.Performance wise, only Mathew Lillard does anything to entertain the absurd (it always has been, just admit it) premise with a bit of hammy acting for the very few short minutes he's there. The rest are mostly monotone or just poor; I never understood why Abby hated her aunt so much and would prefer her disinterested brother Mike (a sleepy Josh Hutcherson), other than the sloppy writing just making her a greedy Karen who the script forgets entirely. The actress for Abby has the worst line reads of the lot and never looks frightened, while the police officer spouts exposition and becomes friends with Mike for no good reason at all.As for that directing, the individual shots and sets out of context look fine - altogether however it's a mess, as if she wasn't confident about how certain moments would turn out and just shot it from tons of different angles for no reason with mostly poor lighting. Tonally the film shifts from attempted horror to drama, back into attempted horror, drama again, then an abrupt light hearted family comedy before shifting gears towards drama and poorly executed horror final act. That resolution to the conflict... it's just plain stupid. If only you could draw pictures in the games, or carry a taser.But none of this matters to anyone who has an emotional investment in the reception of this film. They've waited a long time after plenty of games, let's plays and lore videos to feast on, and they'll be damned if this film isn't an 11/10. Understanding Scott's convoluted lore doesn't make this better - only lowering your quality standards and being biased towards the IP will.

end up happening for no reason, and they make no sense. But as a viewer, you just have to accept it and watch. It was written by a 12 year old at best, random lines here and there that also don't make any sense. I am extremely disappointed that they even spent money making this movie.All the character's actions and dialogue just felt very cheap, I could not follow. The police officer hid the entire plot for quite literally no reason, then decided in the end to finally say something when the time was right (because the time needed to wrap up).

a movie theater... Yours truly, 42-year-old male, went to see "Five Nights at Freddy's with his 14-year-old son. He's an avid gamer and I'm an 80s horror movie fanatic, so we saw this as a rare opportunity to bond. I felt incredibly old and out of place when noticing the theater was chock-full of loud teenagers, and my son probably felt deeply embarrassed because he was the only teenager accompanied by a parent."Five Nights at Freddy's" reminded me of a silly Nicolas Cage movie that I watched recently, named "Willy's Wonderland". That film is a blatant rip-off of the Freddy's videogame, apparently, but it came out 2 years before this 'adaptation'. Well, in that case I can only state it's stupid of the game's rights owners to wait with their own film-version for such a long time. Of course someone else is going to steal your idea of giant animatronics killer-puppets, especially when Nic "quick paycheck" is involved!The film itself is a combo of good and bad, although mostly bad if I'm honest. The script is an incoherent and implausible mess. With "implausible", I'm not even referring to the homicidal puppets, but to the background story of young protagonist Mike. Whilst battling to keep custody over his much younger sister, Mike reluctantly accepts a job as nightwatchman in an abandoned 80s-themed pizzeria and gaming hall. He uses his job as a "watcher" to sleep and re-enact the recurring dream in which he hopes to recognize the face of the man who kidnapped his kid brother more than a decade ago. That doesn't make any sense, I know, but obviously Mike's trauma somehow needs to be linked to the location where he spends his nights. Giant Freddy's mascots come to life at night and kill perpetrators, but the real monster is of flesh and blood.But let's keep things positive also, because - after all - there are far worse ways to spend two hours of your life. Any 2023 horror film that takes the effort to work with old-fashioned animatronic effects instead of digitalized rubbish and green screens deserves a word of praise, especially when the jolly creatures are made by a bunch of people known as "Jim Henson's Creature Shop".

when I learned that there will be a movie I just couldn't wait for it to come. But when I finally saw it today, I thought 'Wow! What a disaster!'Firstly, FNAF has a really interesting and deep lore, in this movie however, the main points of the plot were absent and everything else was mixed up (like what was Vanessa doing there?? Why was William Afton her father??) and felt really rushed. Also FNAF is a tragic story, but somehow there was a happy ending in the movie for everyone? Just why?? Not everything has to have a happy ending.Secondly, I, personally, wanted this movie to be scary, which could've been achieved even with PG-13 rating, but animatronics didn't seem creppy or unsettling at all, like they should have. On the contrary, they looked very sweet and friendly.To conclude I would like to say that this movie was a big waste of time and I recommend watching some letsplays on youtube, they are much better than this cinematic rubbish.

                                                       It's okay. That's what I thought leaving the theater. That's what I think now. I've played the Five Nights at Freddy's games before. They're actually fun, and scary. But this, isn't. It tries to walk a line between a kids movie and a horror movie, but it just seems silly the whole way through. It also completely defeats the purpose how Josh Hutcherson's character keeps leaving the room or falling asleep or PLAYING WITH THE ANIMATRONICS. The movie feels like a joke, but it's going to do what it needs to do, make some money before Halloween is over. For a younger audience, maybe it's fun, but the most it will ever be is a movie some parents turn on in the background at a Halloween party.

              Okok so I watched this move thinking this movie was going to be a horrible fan serviced movie and I am a fnaf fan I love the series.when I watched the movie it explained the story enough for you to think about it and someone who I watched it with wasn't a fan and still enjoyed the movie the pacing of the movie was great the cameos where done perfectly the references the end credits everything about it was awesome the only true problem I had with it was it not being more bloody but hey I think it was best that it wasn't and I also think this movie coulda made it more lore accurate but good movie. I recommend for fans you would have an amazing time totally worth the wait a lot of people hate on this movie over lore and saying it's all over the place and I'd say there wrong they obviously didn't tell u the exact lore but they showed you enough to understand it the animatronics where done well I feel like it wasn't scary but some parts actually got me and the ending was honestly really good it's not to lore accurate neither is is not lore accurate at all it's just a true gift to the fnaf fans sorry for the drag on sentence.

unnecessary plots, How the infinite repetition of the protagonist's dreams that lead nowhere only makes the film even more boring, the film also takes itself very seriously, which makes it even more embarrassing for others, The title doesn't even make sense "five nights at Freddy's", on some nights in that pizzeria the protagonist and the police officer don't do anything relevant, they just chat for the film to make it longer,The entire plot could be summarized in 3 minutes, FNAF fans are used to mediocre content that's why they liked this movie.

was rushed, plot was cringeworthy and completely different to the original games. They should have made it more like FNAF1, which had had a serious tone, creepy atmosphere and subtle, yet horrifying details. That's what makes FNAF and its lore so interesting, it's mystery and subtle details about what happened in the pizzeria, that fear of unknown. Instead, we got everything spoonfed to us halfway through and it completely ruined this movie. It feels like it was purely made for children rather than being an actually accurate movie to the games.

                                                         I guess you need to be a huge fan to seriously enjoy this movie - if you can even call it a movie. Seeing as I know nothing about Five Nights at Freddy's because everything about it bores me to sleep. This alone felt like a snooze fest for me, too much plot and not enough of everything that makes a great movie good. I am mostly glad that I saw this for free and did not waste a cent on it. This being PG-13 explains a lot of how terrible this was. If only this was a rated-R movie with a lot less plot and more in-your-face pee-your-pants horror perhaps I would have enjoyed it more. I would bet there will be a sequel and if there is it better exceed my expectations but I highly doubt it.

Visually, it's amazing! Animatronics looked perfect, set design was flawless and the actors gave it there all but the writing really made everything fall flat. I'm usually easy to scare (and I enjoy it) but I didn't feel that horror genre excitement or suspense. The jump-scares were weak and not one person in the audience seemed surprised by any of them. I was pretty disappointed because I was excited and ready to scream. Even if the scares were good, the story was a bit boring. The cameo was neat but that was about it. Overall I'm just sad to see something that had so much potential fall so flat, especially with how good the animatronics and costumes looked. The person I came with fell asleep halfway into the movie, I wish I was joking 🙃

this franchise will love it.I understand Were the critics are coming from but complaining that a Movie based on a game that has you checking security cameras to be like that the entire time like wtf.I saw someone complaining about the Movie having too much plot and that Its confusing dude FNAF is known for having a plot that doesnt make any senseI guess they could have made the Movie better for people that dont know FNAF much But this Movie is for the fans and if you are a fan go see it in theaters.Its been 8 years and Its finally out letssgooo.

If you are a die hard fnaf fan you will love this movie is packed with Easter eggs and the story is amazing. The critics are talking bs this thing is definitely worth watching in theaters with a packed room of fnaf fans to really experience How good of a movie blumhouse and Scott have put together. Definitely worth the 8 years that so many people have been waiting for. Im calling it this will be the best movie of the century and for generations to come. So what are you waiting for, go to your nearest theater and buy tickets for it as soon as possible.

deeply. I used to talk to friends about each game and watch countless hours of theory videos. I even remember coming back from school each day, holding my breath when I refreshed the website showing sneak peaks of the next game.The models of the animatronics were superb, they were nearly perfect. The only complaint I have is how their eyes just glowed a lame hue of orange whenever they got mad, which does not compare to the hollow white dots of the exoskeleton beneath that you'd constantly see in the franchise.The story and characters were underwhelming. Not at one point throughout the movie did I feel like I genuinely cared about any of it, even though I tried to. There was no suspense, horror or fun. I even started to doze off near the end.Overall, I do think that any fan of the franchise should give this movie a go, just for the sake of viewing more content. But, I do not recommend to people that haven't been invested from the start.

Ultimately, WE LOVED IT. There was a lot of references to the lore, and overall kept us on the edge of our seats. This was a fantastic movie and I would love to see a second one. I hope to see the rest of the characters at some point, too. I wouldn't recommend this as a "family movie" but I still think young adults and people who enjoy FNAF should watch this. Aside from the few jump scares throughout (I am not a guy who cares for spooky movies) I consider this to be more of a thriller rather than "scary" or "horror" which is nice. Overall, I recommend especially if you enjoy the franchise.

wish for and more. The love and care that was put down into the Five nights at freddy's movie for the fans is astonishing and I havent felt this giddy and excited about anything in a long time.While it gave us lots of what we wanted and knew it also surprised in many ways that I feel gave the move an element of surprise and some fun vibes. I love that it in some ways doesn't take itself so seriously all the time to allow for laughter and fun.Thank you Scott and Blumhouse for a job well done, for the respect for the fans and one hell of a movie!

The acting sucked but I blame that more on the poor writing. The script was ridiculous and the story was even worse. The death scenes were lame as hell, I guess to keep it of-13. The only thing this movie has going for it is the costumes.Now going into spoilers...If you have followed the fnaf lore, as I have for some stupid reason, you will recognize most of the characters. They make you believe that we are following Micheal Afton and his sister who later turns into baby. He takes the security job, which makes no sense in the context of the movie btw, and Vanessa is introduced out of nowhere flirting hard. The animatronics only ever lightly attack Mike while he is sleeping and he doesn't even know they are alive until 3 nights of sleeping there. There is no classic fnaf gameplay moment to be had. Phone guy turns out to be afton who is also Vanessa's father who stabs her. I couldn't help but laugh at that scene. Mike is revealed to be Mike Schmidt which was pretty lame. I could go on about how bad this movie was but I'm done wasting my time on it. The timelines don't seem to match up with the games so I assume it's not canon. Fnaf lore has always kinda sucked anyway.

few people would notice. In my opinion the film was amazing mainly due to the amazing design work by Jim Henson's Creature Shop for the animatronic designs, making them as game accurate as possible, while adding their own parts to make them feel as real as possible. The main part i loved about the movie was the amazing acting by Mathew Lillard as William Afton and the rest of the talented cast that performed on set. And to top it off the springlock scene at the end made all my hopes come true making this one of my favourite films of all time.

                   This movie was terrible, there were plot holes all over the place, characters that weren't even supposed to be introduced yet. Over all just ruined my childhood. Vanessa is a character that doesn't come into the fnaf scene until the tail end of the lore and games. Overall her character was confusing and didn't add much to the story? Very frustrating. As for the animatronics I don't understand why spring trap was the only character designed with the classic black eyes we all see in the games. Yes people say red eyes are canon but in the games, these characters are scary because of their eyes and the overall concept. There were so many things included or just not included in the movie lore wise. Honestly, I wasted my time.

I'm not a fan, but I seen some stuff from from a YouTuber (MatPat), with his Chanels Game Theory and Film Theory... pleasantly surprised to see a cameo with him. Actually felt like it was an A List celebrity... films should do this more. He deserved to be in it, due to the amount of work he put into his videos about this franchise. ANYWAY, besides that, I thought it was an entertaining movie for the family (kids being from teens to twenties). I personally would have wanted more horror, but if that's the level they want, it was great! Looking forward to a sequel!

It's basically a horror movie for 12 year olds.Sadly, with the film failing to scare there just isn't anything very motivating about it outside of nice set / costume design -- the plot is very straightforward with "twists" you can predict 30 minutes ahead of time and the acting is just passable.Overall it isn't irredeemable but there's nothing that makes it stand out outside of its ties to a popular video game franchise. My guess is fans of the game may enjoy seeing it on the big screen but as a movie it is too mundane to stand on its own merits.

Stick with me here: I know next to nothing about FNAF, so this is purely going off what I know.It was alright. I wasn't much of a FNAF fan, I always thought it was overrated. That being said, animatronics had a lot of character to them, which I appreciated. They all had their own personalities and actions and in turn, that made them more distinctive than the animatronics in WW.The negatives were Mike. He isn't awful but he was sort of bland. I'm not sure if it's because he is the silent protagonist in the first game so if you like more of a blank slate character, then he fits. Vanessa deserved to be stabbed for her actions to protect her serial killer father (Matthew Lillard). Lillard as Afton was brilliant and I'm happy he was finally getting another killer role, considering he last did it in Scream from 1996.FNAF did have its high points but it didn't do much overall for me. Honestly... Willy's Wonderland did "killer animatronics" better.

Don't listen to the haters. This was a wonderful story with superb acting. I was riveted the entire time. Nothing about this movie was what I expected and I'm completely fine with that. It was honestly way better than I expected.It was giving me retro, although I'm not sure it ever said when this movie took place. If I had to guess, I'd say probably early 2000's. Great atmosphere overall.I'd recommend for older kids and up. It's not really a kid's movie but r here's nothing super duper scary. It's got some jump scares and a spooky vibe. Kinda gave me Gremlins vibes, just less scary than that. I'd definitely watch this again.

                                    Pros: Animatronics are amazing, their movement and design is the best thing about the movie, design team really took their time with them. If you wanna see the movie just for animatronics you won't be dissappointed. Movie keeps fans in mind, there are some cameos and they showed parts of the FNAF lore that fans would be most interested in. Special and practical effects look really good too.Cons: Overall direction is not good, they wanted to give a whole movie this hollywood look with many colorful lights that envoke 80s feel. Now it does look pretty but it doesn't stay faithful to the original material. Story is too simple and straight forward, if you are familiar with the franchise you already know what's going to happen. Acting is kinda dull at times too. But I gotta say rating is what ruins the movie. Because it's PG-13 a lot of violent and bloody scenes took place off screen or in the dark I just wish we got more stuff going on beacuse that's the entire point of FNAF.Overall even tho it's not that great and it falls flat I would still recommend people to see it. It is entertaining at times. It's so nice to see the franchise come to life considering everything that was going on and how long it took to finally make FNAF movie. I just wonder if it might bave been better in someone else's hands.

Acting is good and I feel like the overall concept fit Well. However, I feel there were some bad scenes which were way too slow. There wasn't really ant scary moments, and i didnt really Get any jumpscares. Without going to much in detail, I think the character development was way to bad for a 2 hour movie. If they manager to Get better character development, I would definitely give this movie a 7+ rating. Just some overall mistakes, making it end up as a 5. In short terms = a decent movie, but u wouldn't miss much if u didn't have time to watch it!

expect much because obviously it is made after a game, thus its hard to tell if its going to be good. The atmosphere in my cinema was rowdy, half of the people going to see the film because of the game and the other half as a joke. The film overall had a weak plot, the acting was abismal and it was a hard watch without some jokes in between. That said though, the graphics were great and it will please those who are fans of the game, there are some special apperances and im sure that long fans of the film will appreciate it. My main takeaways are really:\n1. Definitely watch if you are a big fan of FNAF, there are special appearances and it will fill you with interesting content\n2. If you dont know anything about FNAF, DONT GO! If you want to see a good movie go to Killers of the Flower Moon instead, unless you enjoy sub par horror (which wasnt all too scary) I wouldnt go!That said, if you enjoy fnaf then eat your heart out with this one.

watch the movie (9 years of waiting). The movie started and it was great so far but then 1 hour of lore mixing hell started. It wasn't matching up with the original lore and when I seen the animatronics dancing and playing with Abby I was sure at the wrong movie. I couldn't believe how bad the lore was. But the end was good. Spring lock scene (it was alright), end credits (really good). And the acting was good don't get me wrong but it was just not enough. Overall in my opinion I will give the movie 3/10. I was expecting much more for this movie.

ruined it. It should have stick with lore instead of a alternate reality of Five Nights at Freddy's. At least could have William Afton as the murderer in it. Movie is just like any other rip off version of Five Nights at Freddy's. Not recommended at all. Acting is fine so far but for the animatronics costumes with cast inside, it is difficult for them to act like an animatronics. I understand that the writers was given script and can't make changes to it at all. Should have at least some references to the original lore of Five Nights at Freddy's.

I'm not sure what exactly. Firstly, the acting was a bit off in some places so it was hard to enjoy. Secondly, the sister was so extremely annoying that it was almost unbearable to watch. If the acting wasn't enough, the plot quickly became predictable and I knew exactly what was going to happen before, during and after the twist. I expected so much more from this movie and was left very underwhelmed. I will say that the graphics were very well done and it was visually pleasing to look at, but the acting and plot were terrible. Also, a few useless characters thrown in there as well.

incredible... a movie made entirely for fans and non-fans.The story is well developed and there are no gaps in the script or conveniences that ruin the continuity of the film. As for the jumpscares, they are not bad, obviously there are but they are not ridiculous and they are well done, the same as with the 'gore'. The humor, as always, is objective but it is not childish at all and can make you at least smile in those scenes. The acting is quite good, as is the cast, everyone is well chosen and good work is evident from each actor. And the villain... is pure perfection, you can see his perverse way of being when he unmasks himself in front of the entire public and shows his true self.Like any movie based on a popular video game, there is fan service, but in this case I don't find it poorly placed or forced. On the contrary, every detail is well placed and has a meaning, even if it is something minimal.Finally, if you are a big fan of the saga, you will love it completely and you will leave the cinema satisfied. And if you're not, I'm sure you'll find it a decent horror movie.Thanks Blumhouse and Scott, it was worth waiting so many years. <3.

                                          As a big fan of the games, This movie was amazing. From the cinematography to pretty much everything. First, the plot was pretty good. For people not knowing, in the games the animatronics have been known to be bad around adults, as stated in fnaf 2. But that story was great cause in the games there's a minigame just like the ending. For the fans they have delivered very well and also the experience of watching it in a movie theater made it so much better. Personally, more jumpscares would have been great because it's what the games are all about. But if you are a fan of the games this movie would be amazing and if you have never heard of five nights at Freddy's, I recommend you play some of the games and then go back to the movie because you need some knowledge from the games. So if you think the movie was more boring since you dont know much of the story, i recommend you watch youtube videos of it and then come back to it because it would be so much better. But yea one of the best expieriences i have ever had in a movie theater and it was a 10/10 movie would defenitely come back to it 100%.

I've been in the FNAF fandom for years now and I've been waiting for this movie for so long, only to be met with nothing, but poor pacing (introducing around 4 characters in the first 40-50 minutes), no gore or horror, wholesomeness while the movie is supposed to be scary, only one jumpscare and so on.The movie also had good scenes where I actually had hope, like the showing of Springtrap, only to be met with a character that I was just not expecting at all.I am just so truly disappointed I waited approximately 6-7 years only to be met with this bland movie.

 At first, I was a little worried that this movie was going to be treated like a cheep horror flick. But the movie played out much like one of Scott Cawthons books. The aesthetic was exactly what I imagined the books to be and I was so delighted to see that in the movie. I was also surprised and super happy about how we explored the animatronics childish side. That was always something in the fandom that I liked seeing. I never saw it in the actual games. But this just showed how well these people knew their fans!! Also the soundtrack was pretty flippin awesome! The main theme was perfect for the franchise. I also really loved what they did with the end credits. I also loved the teaser for Fnaf 2 at the end with the minigame voice. I loved the casting for this movie. I also also loved the animatronics. They looked way too perfect!! The restaurant too!! Also also also, I loved the cameos from YouTubers in the movie. There was also a reference to the dream theory in the movie. That made me chuckle. I also also also ALSO loved how the movie can stand as its own thing. It was all so perfectly wrapped up so that I could just show anyone the movie and they'd know what the franchise is like. Scott and the rest of the team did above and beyond for this movie. I can confidently say that this is my new favorite horror movie by a long shot!!

The story was really nice, i think it would be better if it was from the original series. But still it was very interesting. I loved Abby's and Mike's brother and sister relationship. I loved the fact that Mathew Lillard played William Afton, and speaking of William, I loved that they keeped his name, I think that the robbers scene could be more gory. The music was really beautiful. The Newton Brothers did a really good job. I loved the fact that they added Sparky and Shadow Freddy, as an easter egg. The movie caught me off guard at the bite of 00 scene. There was some commedy added there, horror, thriller, and a little bit of gore. I really loved the fact that Scott added a lot of things in the movie that we wanted, as the bite of 87(kinda) springlock scene, I always come back, easter eggs, cameos and many others, I don't understand why people gave this movie a really low rating, I think that it was review bombed. Anyways go watch the movie if you didn't saw it, belive me you will not regret, cya!

He loves fnaf as do many kids. I honestly thought this was a really good movie. As a parent it's even creepier with the plot. The animatronic characters were scary and fun at the same time. And from game to screen, I think it was done well.REMEMBER PEOPLE THIS IS FOR FANS NOT CRITICSNOT EVERY MOVIE IS MADE TO WIN AWARDSthis is my sons intro to horror like mine with attack of the killer tomatoes. I honestly wouldn't even be writing on here if it wasn't for my son. Just go watch the movie and remember there's way worse movies to criticize that are now cult classics.

an open mind and very low expectations and I still ended up disappointed.The games were known for having an overall creepy and disturbing atmosphere with effective jumpscares. This movie had none of the unease, none of the creepiness, none of the undertones. It relied olely on jumpscares and those weren't very good. They were tame, predictable and many seemed forced.None of the characters were likable, the kid was annoying and insufferable. The cameos were cringey and obviously not well acted since it was done by people who aren't actors and the story is very slow paced and basically lacking anything scary 90% of the times.I could have ignored all that if the plot had been the classic survive the 5 nights with murderous animatronics, but the majority of the movie didn't even focus on the nights in the restaurant.And the times we did see horror elements, they were mostly implied or just not scary at all. It was a full theater, the majority of the audience were kids aged 13-15 and not a single time did anyone scream or jump in their seat. Which is a very bad sign for horror.The movie feels like an entirely different story that was rewritten to fit the FNAF theme. The animatronics looked great, but their movements looked like humans in fursuits.The only redeeming quality of the movie is Matthew Lillard's acting. He did an amazing job!

                               I really knew absolutely next to zero about Five Nights at Freddy's when I bought a ticket and walked into the theater.Oh sure, I mean, just from sheer pop culture exposure I gathered as much through the years that it's about an old pizza place like a Chuck E. Cheese or whatever and the animatronic animals are all alive or something to that extent.But that's it.That's all I knew.I loved those pizza places back in the early 80's and I love scary movies and the trailer for this looked decent enough for me to give it two hours of my life.I wasn't disappointed.Nor was I lost or out of place with the story here.It's a good 2023 horror flick.But it's not for young kids. At all.At least not those under ten or eleven that aren't familiar with 5NAF themselves.The origin of the characters, that is, the robots it's somewhat terrifying and morbid.I'd say for teens on up this is a good movie for the season.I enjoyed several things about Five Nights.The performances by all the adult leads are commendable: Josh Hutcherson, Matthew Lillard and Mary Stuart Masterson.I also enjoyed Elizabeth Lail as Vanessa and jams by The Romantics!Love The Romantics!This movie is a tad long but not too bad. It could've knocked off a couple of nights and lost nothing.So, if you're in your fifties or older and the only Freddy you know around this time of year is a guy with skin issues who wears a red and green striped sweater, then maybe get hip to this new Freddy on the block.It's okay if you have no idea when you get your ticket.

series except that the kids all love the concept of it, and played it somewhat. Those kids are teens now, and still mostly love the idea of FNAF, including all the cultural stuff outside the games.So, I went to the movies on a Tuesday night with low expectations, except I'd seen the generally poor reviews.It's true that the acting is pretty poor and mostly wooden. The dialogue is often ridiculously inane and the ending is beyond predictable. But, that all fits with this kind of movie. It's mild schlock horror, mostly safe for kids, the story drags you along despite yourself, and with a box of popcorn by your side it makes for a decent night out. I'm glad I saw it on the big screen - it made me stick through the whole thing, and I'm glad I did.

                                                         Definitely a good movie but wasn't necessarily as horrifying as it could have been but that should have been expected with it being mainly aimed at a younger audience. The overall story though was definitely satisfying and tied very well with what is already established in existing media relating to the series, the main character, Mike, definitely has his issues but he is found redeemable through a number of ways. The animatronics are portrayed very well and the children that inhabit them are portrayed in the movie very respectfully to the source material. The movie could have had more visceral content but what it did do, it did well, even with staying within the film's PG-13 rating.

                  This movie was an absolute let down given the absurd amount of time it has been in production. The movie does not follow the title it is meant to adapt in any note able capacity. In all fairness, I do not think an adaptation has to be beat for beat, and I am all for changes to existing content so as to not be alienating to new comers. With that being said, the movie is very clearly made for existing fans, but pays little mind to them in it's story telling. I can say with 100% certainty that anyone with no context of prior material would be lost to anything that was going on.I and all my long term obsessions with the games was lost for a good chunk of it myself. The only redeeming qualities about the film were the fantastic works by the Jim Henson company on the animatronics, the set design, and the inclusion of noteable music as a nod to fans without shameless and out of place cameos. I feel many of the actors' performances suffered greatly from poor direction, so I can't fault them to much. The film would've benefited greatly from an R rating, it's attempts to balance two audiences were clearly not placed in the right hands, and any gorey scenes felt like something you'd find in Birdemic.The writers also appeared to be unwilling to stick to a tone, jumping between family friendly hallmark shenanigans and saw traps. Not to say this can't be done well, it can, but it wasn't. At the very least, it was a somewhat enjoyable watch. In the relm of so-bad-its-good through parts, and a complete drag through others. For just over an hour and a half movie, Avatar (the blue people one) feels shorter.Overall, it's terrible. A pretty shameless cash-grab through the majority, with a few moments of release that at least pulled a laugh or hype here and there. Not worth paying to see in theater, but if you're curious there is always peacock. TLDR.. it's bad. Sorry to all my fellow FNAF kids who were waiting for this one.

I loved it and thought it was great. It's for the fans and isn't gory since there was no gore i. The game so idk what people expected from a $20 million budget film. It's funny how people waited 8 years to see this movie just to give it a bad review. I loved all the work they put into it like the animatronics and the restaurant. They used actual objects instead of CGI to make it look more real instead fake. I like to see other people try to make a good movie like that with a $50 million dollar budget. Also, the movie is more of a game movie instead of a horror one.

The Animatronics were amazing, the mini balloon boy was hilarious, and just the attention to details was incredible. Honestly I hope that movie number 2 will be even better. I'm still so shocked by how great it was. Yet many people say it is bad but for me it was a wonderful experience to go to the movies and watch a movie that I have been waiting for so long. The appearance of Springtrap was also pretty good, not to mention some super iconic quotes and phrases of characters. I think this idea of movies are great and, in the end, I really am hoping to watch what they have planned for the sequel.

If the target audience would've been more for late teens-adult like the video game it could have been a great horror film, instead it was a very clean, kind of family friendly (except some gory parts) scary movie. The story line was kind of stupid and hard to follow at times. There is a lingering question throughout that never gets answered, and characters that never get closure in the story. The movie moved very slow but when there was action it was good action. A couple of good jump scares. Just didn't live up to my expectations when compared to the VR video game.

Seeing this advertise I was really looking forward to it. I can honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've seen on cinema nothing how I imagined it would be. About kids disappearing and not much action very depressing story line. I know there's a game about this which my son loves and told me all about it I can tell you guys if you know the story from the game this movies nothing like that. The whole movie keeps going back to a dream of where his brother has been kidnapped and him chasing some kids asking what happened to his brother really boring.

                                         I was not a five nights at Freddy's fan at the time of watching this movie but despite what everyone said about only fans liking this movie, I actually really liked this movie.Positives: it has great special effects, good acting/actors, some solid kills for a pg-13 horror movie, the soundtrack is amazing, the cinematography and the camera work is really well done. Despite me not being a fan I still understood some of the Easter eggs from the games, I also loved the sibling dynamic between the main characters Mike and Abby, they are likable characters and you actually care for them, Venessa and and Steve raglan/William Afton, are also good characters.Negatives: despite me liking this movie it still has its flaws, and one of them is that its not that scary, sure it has its creepy uncomfortable moments, but that rarely happens, the animatronics could have been more aggressive and scarier. And another problem is the cringe annoying YouTube cameos in this movie, they were unfunny useless and dumb scenes that took away from my experience.But overall great movie 9/10 stars (written by caseynancarrow)



                                           I've been waiting years for this and I am NOT disappointed. The story is different than the games but it gives new opportunity for theorizing like how in this story Vanessa is the afton kid. And there are many moments that make you so excited and remember the games like foxy singing his little tune, the "I always come back" (which when I saw it had the theater SCREAMING and cheering), the way Vanessa introduces herself. And then the MatPat cameo is so exciting too because he is so invested in fnaf and it made me and my friends really excited. There is a story similar to the games but so different at the same time, there is nostalgia that doesn't make you feel like it's a lot, it provides new material for theories, something new for fans to enjoy, and had enough gore to make it scary but still got to be pg-13. There is also parts that make you remember the games and things that happen that are so bad but all you can do is laugh or jump in your seat because you know the games and you know what will happen so all you can do is gasp and laugh. There is also just normal humor in the film like the balloon boy just popping up to scare people which was really funny. I'm giving this a 10/10 because it was a really nice change and different from the normal story and let fans relive these game moments in excitement. Honestly I know some people thought this movie was dumb, childish, and didn't have a good story, but I think it provided everything it needed to and I had an amazing time watching it.

Granted, the plotline was not something i was imagining, but I knew from the interviews, that the plot will be its own.As Scott said, movie was targeted to the fans and he knew not everyone will like it. As its going to be a trilogy, it makes sense that the first movies plot was kinda left in shadows to be seen. As it has been in the games and in the books.I might add that if someone who came to see it solely based on the games might not know or forget what from the animatronics came to life, they might think the movie was too boring or not scary enough on some parts.Animation, music, animatronics and the ambience was made really well and my exitement stayed all the way to the credits and a bit after it.It was such a pleasure to see my childhood horrors on the screen and "alive".I cant wait to see the rest!

I think all the go fans of the franchise like me would agree that the crossover between security breach characters and what seems to be the original final 1 movie was unnecessary. The fan service felt like an excuse and somewhat an attempt to cover up the many plot holes and confusing parts this movie has that do not go along with the actual lore of the game. I was excited from the start as the first jumpscare set a great atmosphere and some expectations. However, as the movie progress, it made less and less sense (not because it's a bad movie, because it is a rather poor adaptation to such an iconic game). Like, come on, supposed William Afton taking his mask off revealing himself and being the guy who hired mike and also Vanessa's father???? The acting from the actors of Vanessa and mike was great, don't get me wrong--I think they hired the right people for the job, but it's the script that is entirely off. It is a rather difficult job to fit so much lore and so many details in chronological order into one movie anyway, but adding random things just for the sake of creating a movie at the end just makes the movie lose its initial purpose, which is the way it's meant to be an adaptation of the game. The graphics were better than I expected, the animatronics were decent--obviously could be more elevated by creating that dark and truly bone-chilling aesthetics of the first game, but that's fine. One aspect that turned this movie from horror, which I believe what we all experienced as kids playing this game, to a children's movie, was how we constantly saw the animatronics move. The entire scare factor of the games comes from the anticipation of a jumpscare and never knowing where the animatronics are. Not seeing them move makes the games, especially the first three (and I guess somewhat the forth one too) so scary. The animatronics becoming abby's friend? Making a fort with her? Mike so easily figuring out and coming to terms with how the animatronics are possessed by ghost children? Like what...the pathetic excuse of a wrap up in the end was even more saddening. In the final games, there's no sort of 'ending'. The lore is so deep that there's almost no incentive anymore--hence it is extremely difficult to convey the events of the game in the form of a movie. Perhaps if they took the documentary/found-footage route, it would be a much more interesting and at least accurate to the events of the game. This way, they wouldn't feel the need to 'wrap up' and show everyone having a great time and get their happy ending, since no such thing really happens in the games. There'd be no need to adopt the usual intro-build up-climax-conclusion format that a fictional movie has, had they used a slightly different approach. They could even take inspiration from those fnaf vhs tapes you see on YouTube.I've waited a decade for this movie, and for me it just felt rushed and that perhaps, all the hype went to the producer's heads or something that they thought adding in just anything as long as they had fan service and many references would be acceptable. Disappointed, to say the least.Yes, they've made a movie. Great. But this definitely isn't something I'll be calling 'THE fnaf movie', nor is it something that will go down in the history books of the fnaf franchise or something. It's funny how it feels like Scott was barely involved in the scripting of this. I'm assuming he just had to be there since he...well...made the game. And in a way it is nice to finally get what we've been wanting for this entire time.Still, it did not live up to the expectations (and was even worse than I expected).

Nights at Freddy's movie, my awareness of the franchise was quite little. Though the games intrigued me, I refrained from diving into the games due to some past trauma that made it difficult for me to enjoy horror. Nevertheless, I enjoyed delving into the game's lore, immersing myself in its complex mildly incoherent narrative.In preparation for the movie, I decided to watch the video titled "Five Nights at Freddy's Lore in Only 8:47:38 Complete History, Timeline Before the Movie #Fnaf." This proved to be a great asset, equipping me with the knowledge needed to appreciate the film. It allowed me to grasp the myriad references, comprehend the profound impacts of the reveals, and stay engaged with the non-stop plot.The film itself is filled with intricate plotlines and rich lore. What stood out to me was the meticulous attention to detail, particularly in the faithful recreation of the security room from the game. As I followed the story, it became evident that the final revelation was somewhat predictable, yet incredibly satisfying.One of the most endearing aspects of the movie was the animatronics. They were so cute and cuddly! I just wanted to give all of them a nice warm (probably cold lol) hug. I already had the expectation that these animatronics weren't necessarily the "bad guys," which made it easier for me to watch the movie. Horror and tension typically triger me, evoking traumatic memories, so I often resort to covering my eyes and ears during such scenes. However, this film presented a unique opportunity, as it was essentially a horror experience tailored for a younger audience, hence the absence of excessive gore. Miraculously, I only had to shield my eyes during two scenes, a feat I consider remarkable.For context, when I watched "The Nun" in theaters, I practically hid my face and wore headphones for the grand majority of the film, overwhelmed by its horror. Similarly, during "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3," I couldn't endure a significant portion of the scenes and ended up covering my eyes for about 40% of the movie. This movie, however, offered a glimmer of hope that I could eventually watch horror films without succumbing to triggers.In sum, my experience with the Five Nights at Freddy's movie was an absolute delight. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and I'm left hoping for sequels in this universe!

everything was predictable as shi and bro if you like this movie i could understand because no one who have hit puberty or one of the human species with no disabilities who have liked this movie because literally someone with autism gave it a 10/10 like bro the characters are getting railed every now and then with no original and generic lines honestly i have watched more than 1000 movies in my life and this one so far is the worst i don't recommend it at all absolute dog shi and horrible i actually couldn't find any positivity in this shi movie.

at a theater to see this thing, I'd be pissed. First of all, I want to give hats off to the cast. I think they were great and played their rolls to the best of their abilities. The problem here wasn't the cast or the effects, ONCE AGAIN it was the SCREENWRITING falling short and missing the mark. Blumhouse use to be a reliable Horror juggernaut for a decade or so, but they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel in the writing department. If it isn't the likes of David Gordon Green screwing up the last two "Halloween" movies, it's this dreck. I will say, the first 45 minutes were promising and I had high hopes, but the second half of the movie was simply confusing and downright weird. The countless confusing dream sequences paired with poor character development made for a very bizarre first watch. It even put me to sleep at one point. After I finished the movie, I had to go back and rewatch certain parts to make sense of what I saw and didn't understand the first time. Almost more than anything, aside from all of the plot problems, the film lacked any true scares. Having a PG-13 rating is NO excuse, the first two "Insidious" movies proved that. The movie wasn't scary one bit and I'm still trying to figure out that little statue "jump scare" that occurred no less than three times.It just didn't do it for me, and I went into it with an open mind, having seen ZERO promos through and through and without reading a single review. I was expecting to like it, but it got in its own way, just like most recent Blumhouse ventures...SMH.

"Plushies", them reading books. I can honestly say they loved it and so did I. They sat here and explained almost everything that happened in the movie. I tbh thought these Plushies were just regular teddy bears kids get into but once my kids explained exactly what the movie explained I was in shock! **SPOILER** a guy that kidnapped kids and killed them and their souls/bodies were put into these animatronics. I did not know that was the backstory again I thought they was just teddy bears. Again I loved that they made a movie explaining what my kids already knew. I give it a 10. My boys have waited for this movie since they've played the game/plushies 6plus years and they did not disappoint. My kids and I are expecting another movie for sure.

and real, they did a great job with them, cast is a bingo, cinematography and design is really nice, the lore was made pretty good (even tho it felt like it was rushed at the end)\nNow let's talk about some things that I personally didn't like (just my opinions):\nThe movie lacked the point of the fnaf games and that is having a jumpscares. I feel like that was the really important thing too because that's the reason why fnaf is popular not only because of the lore but because of it's horror elements. The movie lacked that a lot. I guess there were myb 2 "jumpscares" which didn't even scare me. One thing that I really hoped that they would do is actually make it like a game where Mike needs to survive 5 days, losing his sanity, making sure he doesn't run out of power, make it feel like a real game so we can feel the suspense. Myb if they added more death scenes but since it's pg 13 we couldn't really get that and that sucks. First 50 min nothing was interesting to me, it seemed really boring but after 1h it got okay ig, we finally got some action going on. So yeah.. that's it, I do recommend the movie for the fans that know the lore.

                                                  Through the years of learning and understanding FNAF through my son I really enjoyed this film. Like many others I had my doubts on how they would develop a creative story to tells its fans through a movie rather than a video game but they nailed it! We were all very impressed from the artistic attributes to the animatronics, Freddy Faze Bears play place and restaurant. The acting was outstanding! Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lillard gave out extraordinary performances in the film as well as ("Coreyxkenshin" <- for the real fans!)This video game franchise has had significant success with their released video games and I believe that they will have more success with FNAF movies in the future!

cinema and wasn't sure what to expect as it's a game adaptation but quite a difficult one to translate to a film. They did a good job of keeping it close to the games and there were good horror scenes but at 15 rating nothing too severe.This is a horror film definitely tailored to the younger audience some jump scares and the way that Freddie and the other robots move is creepy in its own right but the story is very hollow as is the case with most horror films, chances are there will be a sequel to follow and hopefully the plot will be better filled out but if you are a fan of the games or just want to watch a decent horror film then five nights at Freddie's is at least worth a watch it's not particularly long and doesn't take a lot of thought.

                                                             I have been enjoying the games for almost 10 years and I'm immensely surprised by how much I enjoyed the film. Just the feeling I had during the entire film was constant happiness with how they could mix elements of the games for just fan fare to how well they could also juggle the plot in a way that a casual audience could understand and digest and have fun with. All the minor details to make the experience closer to the games really got to me.Seeing Coryxkenshin, The references to Sparky the Dog, and MATPAT made me lose my mind. I am so happy I avoided spoilers for the movie because I feel overwhelmed with emotions after watching it.Thank you Blumhouse\nThank you Scott Cawthon.
